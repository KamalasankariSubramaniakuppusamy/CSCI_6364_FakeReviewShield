And you can't do anything about it except cancel it, remove the bag and try the 20 more times to re-insert it.  And as I already said, it wastes a lot of the bag.

If you need to recruit Fighters and another player before you in terms of turn order does that same thing, then you may not get a chance to do so unless you try something else. And you place your workers one at a time - thus it becomes a question of which move is most important - what is your priority and what can you risk someone else taking instead of you? And so even with so limited moves, the game can be pretty compelling.What helps the game feel distinct are Intrigue cards that can only be played when you put a worker at Waterdeep Harbor. Intrigue cards have some pretty diverse effects including recruiting adventurers or forcing other players to give up some of theirs. Or you can allow an already assigned worker to perform a second job in the same turn. But again there are limited slots at Waterdeep Harbor - and every worker placed there means one you couldn't use to draw a new quest or gather more adventurers.The game is brilliantly designed and fairly well-balanced. The random draw of a Lord of Waterdeep that may potentially influence the types of quests you try to take will indeed steer your game play in different ways and helps make each game unique. And even with a mere 8 turns, games with greater numbers of players can last for a fair amount of time and yet will always feel pretty intense. And of course the Forgotten Realms setting adds some nice flavor to the whole experience.Also, the game as one of the best box designs I've seen in a while - even better than Takenoko. They really thought about ease of storing pieces and ease of deploying them again for a new game. The game board fits snugly into the plastic tray in order to better secure all the loose pieces (and those are a lot of wooden workers and different colors of blocks representing the different adventurers), and I really appreciate the fact that they took the time and effort to design the box in this way.Lords of Waterdeep is a great addition to any game collection and nice twist on the worker-replacement game genre. And yes, you don't need to know anything about Forgotten Realms or Dungeons and Dragons to enjoy the game, as I've clearly demonstrated.",5.0,"A brilliant worker-replacement game, even for non-D&D fans",1404777600,"07 8, 2014",Toys_and_Games,"{'CS': 0.798302073, 'MNR': 0.75, 'RB': 3.0, 'RC': 10.0, 'PR': 100.0, 'NR': 0.0, 'FR': 0.2, 'RSP': 0.0, 'AW': 1265.0, 'RD': 0.214689266, 'RL': 2268.0, 'ER': 1.0, 'PC': 1.083423619}",0.0

Every other aspect in design and function is worse.To start with, they've made it shorter.  On the old model, there was enough room to easily get ahold of it and clip it to clothing  There's about an eight of an inch between the back button and the edge, so now if it becomes unclipped while I run, I have to very carefully make sure I've gotten ahold of it perfectly, or else I'll accidentally hit the back button and start my song over.  I don't have big, thick fingers.  I'm 5'5, 125, so my fingers are probably best described as delicate.  This sort of precision was not necessary on the old model.Next, let's go to the software.  On my old model, I never once had to consult the Apple forums.  I keep going back on this one.  It wouldn't play podcasts.  The forums said that it's set to skip podcasts in shuffle mode.  Turn it off shuffle.  Done!  Podcasts still won't play.  Back to the forums. You have to uncheck ""Skip While Shuffling.""  Done!  Podcasts still won't play.  I finally ended up having to uncheck Skip While Shuffling and change the type to music from podcasts.  Now they'll play.  Harder to find, but they'll play.

I've had a chance to play it a few times now, so here's what I've seen:VERY HIGH LEVEL IF YOU DON'T REALLY KNOW GAMES LIKE THISThis is a worker-placement game made by a famous game designer, Uwe Rosenberg.  He has made some extremely well-liked games in the past, and this takes pieces of all of them and puts them all together into this one.  It's a very complex games with a lot of moving parts, options, and time taken (probably around 3 hours).  If you'd like a good idea of the type of game this is, take a look at Agricola and Le Havre.IF YOU KNOW UWE'S GAMESYou're not going to see a ton of originality here.  This almost feels like Uwe took Agricola: All Creatures Big and Small and blew it up 50x.  It's physically a much larger game, a much longer game, a ton more options.COMPONENTSIt's fairly standard fair for Uwe's games.  The pieces are all perfectly sturdy.  The art is OK, but nothing spectacular.  I have two gripes, and that is for the color-blind.  Two of the colors people can play as, blue and.....I guess it's blue-green, are FAR too similar in color, and I really can't see the difference unless they're right next to each other (I'm not very color-blind, but just have trouble telling very similar colors apart unless they're right next to each other).  I had to veto anyone playing as blue-green or else I couldn't tell the difference.  There are arrows on the game-board which indicate that you're supposed to restock those spaces, and some of them end up blending into the art behind them since it's a similar color as well.  We missed restocking a few spaces a few times because of this.The game spaces themselves have an issue where the art indicating what to do on a space can sometimes be VERY small and difficult to read unless you get close.  That issue is even worse with the buildings you can purchase, as they are all fairly small and there is not a good way to see them unless you're right next to them.  Cheat sheets are required to see what is out there, but then of course since there is only one of most buildings, you then need to still check to see what has been purchased.GAMEPLAYIt's mostly standard Agricola fair: you take turns placing workers which let you gather resources, spend those resources to buy buildings, expand your farm/cave, grow your family (more workers), and/or get more animals or vegetables.  The changes:-There isn't a harvest every few rounds, there's a harvest nearly every round.  To make up for it, getting food is a good deal easier than Agricola and the penalty for not feeding isn't nearly as high (it's less points penalized, and you score generally well over double the points in this game than Agricola).-On the flipside, it seems like there are less VERY good ways to get food.  In Agricola, getting a &#34;food engine&#34; going where you can turn single animals/grain into 4-5 food with few if any actions takes the pressure off of feeding.  In this, there are less &#34;engine pieces&#34; for feeding, so getting things breeding and sowed is about the best you can do for regular feeding.-It's far easier to get places to put animals and far easier to sow grain and veggies than Agricola.  It's also worth far more points to have lots of both, than in Agricola.-It's far less important to grow your family quickly, and since you have so many fewer actions to get resources early on without worrying about feeding, it feels like it is much tougher to get the resources to grow your family.-Adventuring.  You can send your workers out with weapons to get things and level up.  The higher the level, the better the things you can get.  It's a very interesting concept and a very different way to get resources.-If someone takes a spot you really want, you can pay some food to just copy it.  So there's less &#34;blocking&#34; and in that sense, interaction in this game than Agricola.-Last, but not least, there are buildings.  Boy are there buildings.  There's dwellings (generally used so you can grow your family), there are green buildings which mostly make things cheaper and/or give you more resources, and then there are yellow buildings which generally give you points.  These all replace the Improvements and Occupations from Agricola.  All of them are available each game and all are available right from the start.THE FEEL OF THE GAMEAs you can see from above, there are some fairly drastic changes from Agricola.  How does it play?  Well, for starters, the buildings are a bit daunting.  There are a ton of them, none are EXTREMELY expensive and most of them are unique, so you realistically need to figure out what path you're taking very early on.  For experienced players, that shouldn't be a problem.  For the inexperienced, it's a TON to take in.Unlike Agricola, there is no hidden information between players.  The round cards come out in a slightly random order, almost exactly like Agricola, but that is the only change from game to game.  For some, that's a positive, as there are many different strategies, all of which are viable in every game.  For some, that's a negative, as each game doesn't feel as &#34;customized&#34; as Agricola, where one game might make sense for you to go one strategy based on the cards you have, and the next a completely different one.In Agricola, other than when cards push you in a different direction, there is a certain flow of what you want to do in most games.  Early, you want to expand your home, grow your family, and get a food engine going.  Mid-game, continue to grow and start to get renovating, animals, vegetables, and fill out your farm with fields and pastures.  Late-game, you want to finish filling out what you haven't done yet and eek out the last points you can get.On the flip-side, there isn't an immediately &#34;best&#34; way to go in Caverna.  Instead, the dominant strategy seems to be going in a direction which no one else is.  If everyone is going for Adventuring, then you can be freed up for farming.  If everyone is filling out spaces on their farm, then you can be freed up for filling up your cave.  The path of least resistance is the path to victory.  Is that more fun?  That is up to you.  But it is a VERY different feel than Agricola.CONCLUSIONSo, is it better than Agricola?  It's hard to say.  I hated Agricola the first time I played it, then liked it a bit more each time, until it became one of my favorites.  Right now, I think I need to play Caverna at least another couple of times to really get a feel for it.My snap judgement is that this is a good game, but not as good as Agricola.  I personally like a game with a bit of hidden information.  I miss the Occupations/Minor Improvements as a mechanism to push you in a direction no one else wants to go.  I miss the fact that every turn, there is a fight over certain resources.  I miss being able to actually block other people.  When playing Caverna, I find myself not so much caring what people are doing on an action-to-action basis, just what they are doing overall, so the game feels a bit less interactive.  And finally, I really miss the fact that even if I do an awesome job with my strategy, it doesn't stop people from doing just as awesome, if not more awesome at another strategy and winning.If you're a fan of Uwe's other games, this is definitely worth a try, but with the hefty price tag, it might be worth trying a friend's copy first and seeing what you think before jumping in head-first.",3.0,"Caverna, the greatest thing since sliced bread?

Unfortunately the strap on this bag could be a bit more thicker than it is. Not too thin...but for a gal that carries alot like me...It was not thick enough at all.As far as the feel, the bag is a okay nice faux leather feel. Very soft. Not bad.The drawstring is nice, I had no complaints as far as the detailing goes on this bag, I loved the little pocket that hangs on the outside if the bag. So the details were ok.But because the leather is so soft along with the bag being so light weight It didnt stand up well at all. So there is no form to the bag when you sit it down. Honestly there is a split compartment inside the bag and it would be alot better if it were just a open bag. I also think to get your bag to sit upright, you will need a purse organizer with a hard bottom. Because again this bag is very light weight and soft, so the floor of the bag does not have a strong bottom.So finally the major issue that I have with this bag is the SMELL! I suffer from bad allergies and the smell of the bag completely turned me off. I tried airing the bag outside for hours and still the smell was there. geesh!So my final review of this bag is honestly if it were priced at 20 bucks and they could get rid of the smell it would be a nice buy. So I dont like to tell people what to buy, but this just my review on the bag. Take it as you will. Now I have saw a few more bag with this company that I am interested in, and I would give them a second try. (As long as they dont have the same smell as this bag did).",3.0,Ummm?

Given the advice of others, I decided to obtain smooth valve stem tubes for my road bike and shoot a bit of silicone lube into the chuck before using it the first time. Both putting on and removing the chuck couldn't be simpler.* The handle is another pleasant nod to the past. I'm a sucker for vintage touches, and I appreciate the tactile feel of a wooden handle much more than anything made of plastic. On that note, the leather pump plunger (besides being inexpensive to replace and easy to find) is another bonus.* The volume of air that this pump moves is good, as well. I didn't do any objective testing until I received the older Super Pista to compare. This pump pushes twice that of the older model from 13 years ago, due to a slightly taller/wider piston design.CONS:* The base is plastic, which is a disappointment indeed. I understand Silca's need to keep costs down and compete with other manufacturers, but still. No matter how you slice it, the cheap feel of the base diminishes the overall impression of this pump completely. I spoke to a sales rep the other day that informed me that Silca has completely discontinued the use of metal bases, and has been quietly rotating in their stock with ""composite"" ones.* The pump shaft rattles. Significantly. It appears that the air inlet is now designed in a sort of periphery around the shaft opening in the closure cap (at the top of the piston). An interesting idea for improving air-intake I suppose, but the very noticeable rattling whenever you even touch the pump is a serious downside.After a few weeks of comparing this pump side-by-side to a few others (including a new Z&eacute;fal Husky, an older Silca Super Pista, and a 2008 Bontrager TurboCharger) I really couldn't get past the junky rattling sound every time I picked this one up, and returned it. The whole idea behind my decision for this purchase was to get something without lots of plastic and a cheap feel.

Thought this would do well enough as it can go from bare floor to carpet easily.

I was impressed for a SPLIT second with my first use of this Hoover, it picks up dirt from bare floors QUITE well (but JUST dirt, WILL NOT PICK UP ANYTHING BIGGER THAN A TINY CRUMB) and this unit IS very quiet but those are the ONLY good qualities.  Horrible electrical smell when in use (afraid to use it).  Others mentioned how the hose lacks the ability to swivel, which is SUPER frustrating when trying to vacuum anything.  NEVER had that problem with my Kirby, this unit NEVER compared to the suction of the kirby, the cord was literally A THIRD the length of my kirby cord, CLAIMS to have a HEPA filter because that always seems to make people feel all warm and fuzzy inside but the canister BARELY SEALS on it.  They can say there is a HEPA filter because there is one between the hose and the motor but there are STILL dust particles flying out after that point (once it passes the motor and enters the canister)  You can see the dirt all around the canister when you remove it showing CLEARLY the just blowing right back into the air...GROSS!  I would NEVER bring this to a customers house so I guess I will stick to my Kirby until I can afford another WELL WORTH $1000 vacuum.

Admittedly, Valentina does not look as good out of the box as she does in the Amazon picture. While her face is aristocratic, her hair is soft and beautifully highlighted, and her make-up is the best I've seen on a Bratz doll so far, but she just doesn't look as classy as she does on Amazon. But I love her none-the-less, because she is beautiful and fits into every look I've tried on her from my (extensive) collection of Bratz outfits. Orianna has pearly lips remeniscent of the 60s Barbies, and if you don't like her in the Amazon picture, you won't like her when you get her. She does have a way of growing on you, but I ended up giving Orianna to my younger sister because she loved her more than I did. Both of the twins come in well-made clothes, butValentina's jacket is easier to take off than to put on. Both of them wear boots, yet they are a bit hard to put on. Once you put them on, though, they dolls look stunnig. Accessory-wise, Orianna comes with an awesome guitar and Valentina comes with a case holding two fashion sketches. Generally, these dolls have a large replay value because you can easily mix and match their clothes and accessories with other Bratz sets. This is the perfect present for any Bratz lover, and while I mentioned several negative points, both dolls are incredibly beautiful. If you want to get your Bratz lover a set that is rare, beautiful, and overwhelmingly cool, save your money and buy this set.

Caruso ""The Happy Aspie""","[6.0, 10.0]","We (my husband, son, and I) are Toy Story and LEGO fans, so this seemed like a perfect choice for a family activity and toy.LEGO thoughtfully puts the pieces in little bags with one for each car, which makes navigating the visual assembly diagrams a little less frustrating.Assembling this was a lengthy affair and there was more than one mention of the time it took to build the transcontinental railroad. It took my husband (he has been an avid LEGO fan for at least 30 years) and I (I'm the person that doesn't read the manual and likes to figure it out on her own, though I do have limited dexterity which makes LEGO a challenge for me) almost 2 hours to assemble all of the cars.Once assembled, the train and the cars are pretty cool.  Though due to the intricacies of the construction, this doesn't seem to me like a set you would really take apart and build something else (which is what I loved do do as a kid)...All of the main characters are represented and I like having our favorites (Buzz, Woody, Hammy, etc) in our general LEGO man population. I do wish they looked more like LEGO interpretations of the characters though (like in the LEGO video games of Star Wars and Indiana Jones), but they are still pretty neat to have.One of the cars has a trapdoor mechanism which is fun (my 7 year old had a ball making the LEGO guys disappear)...This is a train made out of LEGO and I was surprised that once it was assembled, it is pretty sturdy. After playing with it for a little while I feel like I can appreciate the epic instructions, all of the tiny pieces, and the lengthy construction.The one thing this train doesn't have is tracks.  For some reason, the image on the box made me think it was more of a train set than just a train.  Not that you need the tracks, as the wheels do just fine on tile, but I was hoping to add a motor and have it circle a track of some sort like a more traditional train set.All in all, it is a nice set and perfect for a Toy Story and LEGO enthusiast.  The construction is challenging though, and in my humble opinion, the construction is too challenging for the age group that would really play with this, and I feel that maybe this is more of a collector's item.  For our family, it meant that we spent 2 quality hours working together toward a mutual goal, and then all of us were proud of the results.

The games/dvd and the connector is probably a little too much for him. He doesn't have the attention span to play the games. When he sees the receiver/connection device, he wants to yank it and pull it out.As a ride on toy, I love it! He's grown to love it. At first he would sit on it and bounce, get bored after a couple of minutes. Now, he's 20 months, he LOVES to sit, bounce and spin. The little noises the toy makes (galloping sound), makes him giggle. It is VERY sturdy. Putting the thing together was a bit cumbersome and we had to use a rubber mallet to get that last piece in. (The base comes in separate pie pieces that you have to connect together and fit into the slots). Then there are metal prong/legs that slide into the green base to hold the horse in place. It's definitely sturdy. I don't worry about my son tipping backwards (or forwards) in this. He does have short legs and he's able to bounce and climb on and off - so that's a plus for smaller babies.Why the 3 stars? I think it's pricey for what we use it for.

Unfortunately, it was designed to be looked at, not played with.  Right on the back of the package it clearly states DO NOT move Rex's head or his arms or you might damage the product.  That's right, you're not supposed to play with this toy.  The legs barely move at all (maybe a 1/2 inch).  So you can't make it walk like Rex does in the movie.  My daughter is a huge Toy Story fan.  We bought her the Toy Story Collection: Buzz Lightyear and she plays with it non-stop.  But with Rex, she can't do anything with it but sit it on the table and listen to it talk.  On top of that, the tail unscrews very easily.  You unscrew the tail to replaces the batteries.  But the slightest twist of the tail by a child whom might pick it up by the tail or, *gasp*, swing it by the tail will cause the tail to come right off.The first thing my daughter did when she got this toy was try to turn the head and move the arms.  But when she did, you hearing this ""clicking"" sound indicating that the head/arms aren't meant to be turned by themselves.  So, yes, the box is right.The toy lasted all of 72 hours before we decided to return it to the Disney Store where we bought it.  It didn't break.  It just wasn't fun since my daughter couldn't actually play with her new toy.  We ended up buying a Rex plush doll (the only other Rex toy they had) and she's had tons more fun with it that she did with this $60 collectible.In summary, if you're looking for a collectible to sit on a shelf and admire, this Rex is perfect for you.  It looks just like Rex, and the toy is programmed with the original actor's voice from the movie.  But if you're looking for a toy that you or your child can actually play with, do not buy this.  When there's a warning on the back of the box telling you not to move it's head & arms or you risk breaking the toy, well, that pretty much tells you it's not meant to be played with.",3.0,"Not a toy, a collectible",1268956800,"03 19, 2010",Toys_and_Games,"{'CS': 0.670624965, 'MNR': 0.0, 'RB': 0.0, 'RC': 3.0, 'PR': 66.66666667, 'NR': 33.33333333, 'FR': 0.0, 'RSP': 0.0, 'AW': 957.0, 'RD': 1.666666667, 'RL': 1989.0, 'ER': 0.0, 'PC': 1.348747592}",0.0

With the waist straps you relieve your left shoulder of some weight but I just would not recommend this bag for long hikes.  For me, since the sling strap was on my non-dominate shoulder, fatigue was an issue during long hikes.  And after awhile, taking the camera put while you're tired from hiking is just a bear.

Christmas morning they were very excited and we got right to building one of the structures shown in the instruction manual.  At first, I was very pleased with the purchase.  However, shortly after we completed the ""fort"" my two year old used one of the bars to pull her self up which instantly lead to two of the yellow connectors breaking.  Apparently, there is a failure point on the connector where they attach to the ball joint which sheers relatively easily rendering that connector (and by default one of the bars) useless.  Shortly after 2 more broke.I did not let this setback deter me and I convinced myself these were probably a handful of pieces that were not cast 100% correctly.  The next morning I called Toobeez and emailed them in hopes of getting some replacement pieces mailed. On the phone I was met with a recorded message claiming they were on the line with another customer and I should leave a message, which I did.  Since then I have called between 40 and fifty times, and without fail, I am met with the same recorded message without the option to hold.  Nobody has returned my call and I have received no response to my emails.  Clearly, the automated message is just a shell to avoid providing any customer service what so ever.Since Christmas, 8 connectors in total have broken, all at the same place.  As if it weren't bad enough, there is no way I could even order just the connectors since I can't talk to anybody or get any response.  At first I thought I would be buying anther set for their birthday to expand our building capabilities.  Now, I am pretty hopeless since each connector that fails means fewer and fewer parts we can use since the set is designed to have a connector for each piece of the structure.I think the idea of the set is great in that it provides a mechanism for younger children to develop their motor skills in construction and then their imagination playing with the structure.  However, it appears that it will ultimately be a waste of $150 since I cannot find a way to get replacement pieces and I am most certainly not going to purchase another set.My advice...........look for a manufacturer who provides a similar product but stay clear of this one.",1.0,Great idea but poor execution & customer service,1390521600,"01 24, 2014",Toys_and_Games,"{'CS': 0.0, 'MNR': 0.0, 'RB': 0.0, 'RC': 0.0, 'PR': 0.0, 'NR': 0.0, 'FR': 0.0, 'RSP': 1.0, 'AW': 0.0, 'RD': 3.481481481, 'RL': 2351.0, 'ER': 1.0, 'PC': 0.529941706}",0.0

The Blacks are good. Not the best, but def solid. It almost appears that the screen itself while power is off is slightly gray, which makes the blacks suffer a bit.I would rate this as 5 stars on picture quality alone, but there are too many issues for me to keep this TV. This was also my first Plasma TV.The number one issue is the buzz. It's no joke, it's loud and it's very annoying. I'm not sure if it's the acoustics of my room, but I swear it's louder 16 ft (where I sit) away than it is with your ear right next to the TV. The other thing about the buzz is, it's a very focused sound. What I mean by that is, picture a flashlight's beam of light. That is how the buzz sound is. My chair which is obviously the best seat in the house is the only seat that you can hear this buzz. You sit in my wife's seat, which is right next to me and nothing. Even if you stand up from my seat the buzz disappears. So, this might not be a major issue for some who sit slightly off angle.Now you can turn up the sound and wash out the buzz, but after any break in sound you hear it. In the morning at normal listening levels I hear it over the sound. Even with the news on where there is no reason to have the sound turned up, you can hear it. Too distracting to me and it's all I focus on now which is unfortunate.The other issue I have is when I use this on my HTPC. When I display an all white back round, such as a webpage, I notice the middle of the screen from top to bottom about a foot wide has a slight greenish tint to it, while the screen to the left or right has a slight pinkish/reddish tint. No matter what setting or cable I use I can't get rid of this. Although, I do not notice this while watching TV while a white screen comes up. The LCD it replaced never displayed that. This would also be a non-issue for most consumers.The other issues isn't from the TV itself, but rather the technology. Again back to a computer screen, while browsing the web where the back round is white and you have a solid darker image on the screen it will cast a shadow of that image across the entire screen horizontally. Even large bold fonts on a white back round will display this ""shadow"". And then we have the risk of image retention. Since I use this as a computer monitor as well I am in constant fear of the dreaded IR. I always switch the image up, but I know when I'm gone my wife will not do this and leave static images while cleaning or talking ETC... Also, the heat factor. These babys burn. They get hot which tells me I'm in for a much higher electric bill this month. I knew most of the issues going in, so shame on me.The last issues didn't bother me, but my wife and family commented on the fact the TV isn't very bright and doesn't have the bright as they called it, but over saturated colors like a LCD/LED. Believe it or not, most people actually love the ""torch mode"" with dynamic contrast turned way.All in all, looks like I'm going with the LCD/LED model.",3.0,"Great picture, but can't be overcome by issues.",1297382400,"02 11, 2011",Electronics,"{'CS': 0.71780588, 'MNR': 0.0, 'RB': 0.0, 'RC': 1.0, 'PR': 100.0, 'NR': 0.0, 'FR': 0.0, 'RSP': 0.0, 'AW': 0.0, 'RD': 1.166666667, 'RL': 3079.0, 'ER': 0.0, 'PC': 2.218570255}",0.0

I really do.  The problem with them, is they don't wash well.  You know when you put something through the washer accidentally with the towels, and they come out all bumpy and such.  Well this is what happens after the 2nd washing --- and that's even without being washed with towels.  The most annoying part was that the part that was bumpy, was the cloth that went up against your skin, so I ended up ALWAYS wearing them inside out.Maybe there was some special wash directions, but being a new mom (whether it's the first time or again), you're just lucky to get laundry done, and add in special directions - and those will never happen.The other thing I noticed was the stretchy band that lays underneath the bra would roll or get a kink in them (I have multiple bras).  It never did stretch though, but it always did roll or fold on itself.All in all, as long as you wear them inside out and can tug at the band here and there - they were comfortable. I changed the rating from 4 to 2 (even though I recommend them) because the quality isn't as good as they should be.It's a love hate relationship. :)***Original comments***I have yet to wash them, ( I know I should wash them before I wear them but I was desperate)... but these are so darn comfortable.  I'm a plus size girl, I wear size 20ish or XXL tops.  My bra size during pregnancy and after is 44D, and the XL fits awesome.... they are light and flexible and soft to the skin.  I honestly feel like I'm not wearing anything, but I have the support I need during the night.I only plan on wearing them at night, but if needed could wear them in public.I will update this if I have a bad experience after the washing.. but these are a must.

They slip and turn easily in the shaft and do not stay where they should no matter how tightly you set the bolt.  I lined the insertion bar with duct tape to give it some grip and that works for a while before I have to do it again.My son did have trouble peddling at first.  He is two and has never been on a bike before, so that was to be expected.  After a couple of months of practice he has had no problem peddling the trike.  He is now two and a half years old and still plenty small enough to get quite a bit more use out of the tricycle.  Until he figured out the pedals, he was able to walk the trike.This tricycle has not tipped while my son is riding it.  For a two-year-old, he gets it going pretty fast - believe me, this child is a total kamakaze.  He has already fractured his skull, cracked his cheeck bone, and is always one giant bruise with his wild antics, but he hasn't had a single accident on this trike.  My older kids (4,5, and 6) could probably tip this trike, but they really are too big to be on it in the first place.  This is the smaller model of the radio flyer tricycle and is for the little bitties.  It is rated for 2-4 but I would say 2-3.  It's ok for smaller 4 year-olds, but if you are buying a trike for a 4 year-old, a larger model or even a small bike with training weels will be a better investment.Overall, I love this trike, but the shifting handlebars have been an enormous headache for me having to constantly fix them and for my son constantly unable to steer his trike.

I won't know how the battery life is for awhile, so I can't comment on that now.The keyboard is fine, some reviewers say it is loud, but they are probably younger, or newer to computer people who grew up on the soft touch keyboards that are relatively silent. I have been using computers for quite awhile, and like the tactile feel and clicky sounds a keyboard makes, let's you know when they have been pressed. This isn't as loud as the old ibm clackers of yesteryear, but is a bit louder than your average softouch.The function keys are a bit smaller than I would like, but usable, even though they are covered with symbols for all the other funky things they do, and the F numbers are barely readable as though an afterthought. There is also the usual conglomoration of multimedia and programmable keys that are now all the rage, though I personally find most of them just annoying. I do like the volume being able to be adjusted, as well as the one touch key to bring up the calculator.I usually don't install the software to make all the fancy keys do their fancy tricks, but I did on this one. It has some Windows 7 specific keys and functions in it, and since I am running that OS, thought I'd give it a go. You get 5 special keys that open the first 5 programs in your taskbar, no big deal, think I've used them once to see if they work. They do, but... for me... no biggie...The mouse.... now that is a good news bad news issue for me. It works great, on multiple surfaces like they claim, and the buttons have a nic click and feel, not too easy to accidently press down, not too hard. The scroll wheel.... that's the sticky point so to speak. It scrolls fine, but it doesn't have and clicks to feel while you are scrolling, it is totally smooth. Whoever thought that was a good idea must have had too many coffee's or redbulls, or something. It's not hard to use, but it does scroll pages while your reading if your not careful, not to mention for gaming it is horrible if you use that to switch weapos as you don't know when to stop and it shoots past the one your trying to get.It's definitely a step up from 1000 series, the keyboard actually has a rubber pad on the wrist rest for one, not as cheap feeling either.

When I ordered and received this pair of binoculars instead (Melissa and Doug is always a reliable bet, right?), I was really surprised at how small it was.  Its okay, since they are for small kids with small faces, but its not really a &#34;substantial&#34; item.  I guess the compactness and lightness can be considered a &#34;pro&#34; since it doesn't take up much space and it actually folds down even further.I do think the neck strap is a danger however.  I understand that part of the fun of having a pair of binoculars is wearing them around your neck -- but kids know that too and thats the first thing they do is to put the string over their neck.  My issue is that it really is more of a flimsy string, and not a real thick safe strap.  Its the kind of cheap string that twists up around your neck as soon as you put the binoculars on and start to move around.  Total strangling hazard in my eyes, and this is for an item that is recommended for as young as 36 months.The string is also cheaply done, and is threaded from back to front, rather than left to right, which means that the binoculars don't really lay flat on your chest, but rather twists to one side, even further promoting the twisting and the choking of the neck.I'm going to be removing this &#34;strap&#34; with a pair of scissors.

I've been averaging about a loaf every other day and the machine has worked flawlessly.My only flop with this machine was trying an overnight bake to have fresh bread in the morning.  As others have stated, the manual is pretty crappy.  The display shows time to completion for the bread so pressing the ""time"" button ups that time; the actual prep and baking time remain constant.  My bread came out with a sour dough which no one in my family liked; none of the ingredients should have spoiled.  I will be trying this again soon as I do believe it was user error.I've been experimenting with various recipes from web and books and put on some weight :)  The paddles generally stay in the pan when I dump the bread; a very pleasant surprise and they are very easy to remove when they don't. The holes created by the paddles do not interfere with making sandwiches (Yippee!)

The wrenches do not fit all rear sights and are very easily lost due to their size, The picture shown in Amazon reflects it to be an 11 piece tool, the one I received has only 9, parts missing are the extra steel punches, plus it shows one allen wrench and there are two, I would highly recommend that the company either change the representation of the product to what you are actually receiving. The quality of the product is strong and would be a true benefit if it had all parts shown in their add good, Because of missing items I can still only give The M&P ARMORERS GUN MAINTENANCE TOOL 3 STARS E.C.

I liked the idea of the carafe-less design and the overall look of the machine.Since I am not a coffee expert, I will leave the taste tests to those who know more what they are talking about. I generally drank darker beans, black with this machine and the flavor was fine for me.As far as the way the machine works in day-to-day use, I was pleased, but not wowed. For it's task, making coffee, it works. It's not horribly fast or slow, just does what you would expect which is good. However, there are a couple of flaws that make the experience less than ideal. First, the reservoir is not removable, which is fine, except that there is no easy way to pour water into it. My solution was a 4 cup Pyrex measuring cup. Second, there is simply not enough room for tall travel mugs to fit under the pour valve. Again, the solution was a Pyrex measuring cup. While neither of these situations are ideal, they really weren't deal breakers.The deal breaker is Cuisinart's apparent lack of quality. After roughly a year of service, the DCC-2000 began turning itself on and off just as my old DCC-1200 did. After some research, it seems the likely issue is water rolling off the lid, down the back of the unit and getting into the electronics and shorting something out. I have no way to actually verify this, but I can tell you that water would routinely run down the back of both machines. If this is the problem, why Cuisinart has not waterproofed the area where the electronics are is beyond me. The good news is that Cuisinart has an excellent warranty with excellent customer service. They are sending me a DCC-2200 to replace the DCC-2000 because of backorders.If you really want a carafe-less machine, this definitely fits the bill, and the coffee, in my opinion, is good. However, be prepared to have it replaced as it seems Cuisinart's quality is not what it used to be. Even though their customer service and warranty was excellent, I have decided to go another direction with the Bunn My Cafe and leave the replacement from Cuisinart in the closet for backup.",3.0,Great until it dies.,1262908800,"01 8, 2010",Home_and_Kitchen,"{'CS': 0.406407427, 'MNR': 0.0, 'RB': 0.0, 'RC': 1.0, 'PR': 100.0, 'NR': 0.0, 'FR': 0.0, 'RSP': 0.0, 'AW': 0.0, 'RD': 0.496626181, 'RL': 2198.0, 'ER': 0.0, 'PC': 1.961883408}",0.0

Feinberg ""Philip Feinberg""","[2.0, 2.0]","For background info purposes, let me first say that my Samsung is rooftop antenna-connected via an RF modulator, and it is not connected to any other units (VCR, DVD player, ...). This is the same setup I maintained with the 18 year old TV the Samsung replaced, and I simply ended up reusing the RF modulator as a preference option. This decision, however, turned out to be one supported by a Samsung tech support person, who said that the modulator would enhance the picture quality all the more.Whether or not picture quality is enhanced by the modulator connection, I cannot say, as I haven't tried my setup without it. All I can say is that the picture quality is excellent, and that is without having had to do any adjustment tweaking (sharpness, contrast, brightness, ....). Thus, I would rate picture quality as my Samsung's best, most satisfying attribute.I am also pleased with the user-friendly remote. The numerals are generously large, and are color-contrasted with the remote's black background, which adds to visibility ease. Other icon and identifier buttons are likewise easy to ID and access. Moreover, buttons are nicely clustered, enabling easy location/activation.Samsung also gets kudos for the user-friendly owner's guide, which even I --- a tech-challenged hater of instruction manuals --- was able to navigate for set-up and adjustments, thanks to the thorough and easy to follow, step-by-step instructions and helpful illustrations. I surprised myself by completing the set-up, including programming the remote, with little angst and no tantrums!With regard to dissatisfaction, I would rate Samsung's overall sound quality as its primarily negative feature. It is woefully sub-standard and most disappointing. Without exaggeration, the sound quality emitted by this Samsung model is actually inferior to that of my old TVs, low-end computer, and even my inexpensive radios. The sound is tinny and""echoey"". And unfortunately,neither the manual-based sound adjustment options nor Samsung tech support contacts were able to completely overcome the sound deficiencies. I'm thinking that the type and location of the TV's speakers --- on the bottom of the unit --- may be part of the problem. However, I was able, by strictly trial and error, to achieve some sound improvement by playing around with the bandwidth adjustments (per the Sound Customizing section of the manual). I have since found that the sound quality, whether due to my happenstance adjustments or not, is just a bit improved, but tends to vary with channel (including digital), as well as with voice vs. music output. Actually, at times, the music-based sound comes through well. I don't understand the sound variability enigma here, which is somewhat annoying, but I have determined that I can live with the sound in its current state, though reluctantly so.The one other negative feature is the ridiculously small, channel ID caption square (blue background/white numerals) which appears at the top left on the screen when making a channel change. Now, my distance vision is quite good, and I have watched TV from the same distance for 32 years, never having a problem seeing any emergent captions, etc. on any TV. But with this Samsung, especially when channel surfing, I literally have to get up from the couch and move a bit closer to the TV to see the caption figures. And with the multitude of adjustments that one canmake for so many of the Samsung features, you'd think that the caption could be enlarged. But alas, a Samsung contact revealed no such option.Would I have purchased this Samsung, based on knowing what I know now relative to the above? I think I'd probably opt to check out other Samsung models or other brands altogether beforehand, which is my recommendation to other potential buyers.",3.0,"Samsung, a So-So",1238716800,"04 3, 2009",Electronics,"{'CS': 0.361026943, 'MNR': 0.0, 'RB': 0.0, 'RC': 1.0, 'PR': 100.0, 'NR': 0.0, 'FR': 0.0, 'RSP': 0.0, 'AW': 0.0, 'RD': 1.180451128, 'RL': 3800.0, 'ER': 0.0, 'PC': 1.55604954}",0.0

Boy, they were like ovens heating up the hard drives inside. I had to resort to methods such as using (expensive) thermal pads to create a conducting path from the AL enclosure to the hard drive, and blowing air at the enclosure with a Thermaltake mobile USB fan to keep temperatures down. It was a messy and unelegant solution. That was in 2010.Enter Rosewill's enclosures.I have 3 of these enclosures (from the early e-sata/ usb 2 model to the latest e-sata/ usb 3 model), and I am still very happy to have discovered them. I first found them on NewEgg in 2011, where they have a huge fan following.1. TemperaturesThe Rosewill RX-358 U3C enclosure has an 80 mm fan that keeps my drives cool at about 40 degrees celsius. I do not have to worry about my drives failing prematurely due to prolonged high temperatures. It even has a switch to turn the fan off should you wish to do so for whatever reason.2. Durability/ designThe RX-358 U3C's aluminum exterior is also very sturdy and I dare say built like a tank. While its matte finish is simple and somewhat dull looking compared to the glossy plastic finish that is so ubiquitous today (sadly found in everything from LCDs bezels to cellphones and what-not), it still looks way better than that ex-sexy glossy finish when it - and it definitely will - gets scratched up over time.3. SpeedThe articles on the USB 3 interface that I've read, such as those by Tom's Hardware, conclude that getting a good speed over USB 3 depends not just on the host controller, but also  on the device controller. The USB 3 chip used by the RX 358 U3C is the AsMedia 1051. It is the same used by the Thermaltake BlacX 5G which scored well in the USB 3 speed benchmarks. On my PC's old Renasas UPD720200A USB 3 host controller, the Western Digital 20EARS has an average read speed of 90 MBps when connected through the Rosewill enclosure.4. OthersOne thing that I am still unable to find is information on its warranty period, if any.** Disabled the LEDIf you dislike the bright blue LED as I do, it can be disabled easily. Just follow these steps:Open the enclosure and turn it in the direction such that the circuit board is further away from you than the fan.Pull out the 3rd white connector (the one next to the USB 3 jack) which is connected to with blue and black wires. You should see that it is labelled ""LED Con"" on the circuit board.",5.0,A very good enclosure.,1344384000,"08 8, 2012",Electronics,"{'CS': 0.696781861, 'MNR': 0.0, 'RB': 0.0, 'RC': 16.0, 'PR': 31.25, 'NR': 25.0, 'FR': 0.3125, 'RSP': 0.0, 'AW': 1235.0, 'RD': 0.544444444, 'RL': 2492.0, 'ER': 1.0, 'PC': 4.367245658}",0.0

So we bought it as a christmas gift for her. It did seem to take a while to set up, but it didn't bother us much. We popped the disc in and were disappointed to find out that the software included is only just a sample... which meant another trip back to the store to get games for her to play. Once we had purchased the additional software we sat down for some fun learning. But there is a big problem. The response time (from the time you push a button until something actually happens on the screen) is very lengthy. It took so long that my daughter made no connection that her pushing the button was what made the character on the screen move some 30 seconds later. Needless to say, she became very bored of this very quickly.

It seemed logical to spend the money up front to play some fun courses and practice at home. I received my Optishot within a week and took the time to set it up correctly. I didn't have any trouble with the lighting requirements and all my clubs seemed to read the ball flight well. At first the Optishot responded well to my shot type- I was able to draw and fade the ball as I normally would on the golf course. As a low handicap player I wanted to practice shot shapes and other ball flights with my irons to really hone my game. After playing the Optishot for a week- I ended up returning it for a refund. Don't get too turned off if you are a beginner or a weekend warrior though...Here were some of the issues I faced:1. The Optishot mat sits about an inch above your feet so be sure to build or buy a mat where you can strike the ball level to your feet. I added a door mat with a rubber bottom to level it out.2. It can't distinguish a good shot from a bad shot because the sensors only read swing speed and club face orientation. For instance, if you top the ball but still have a square face at impact, the Optishot will think you hit a great shot. Thin or fat shots just can't be read with this type of simulator.3. Low handicappers who hit down on the ball to produce spin will not like the Optishot. You will end up hurting your wrists and shoulders because hitting down on this hard mat is not as forgiving as hitting a real ball on turf. Plus, your club will bounce upon impact resulting in an untrue shot.4. Using a sand wedge for chipping around the greens is not accurate. If you hit a low trajectory ball with spin into the green on the golf course, you will not be able to do so with the Optishot. It simply reads your swing speed and produces a typical trajectory.Having said this, the Optishot can help beginning and higher handicap players who want to learn or correct your slice or hook. It can be a good tool to bring your game up to par for those who are looking to practice on their own time in their home. But given my experience, the Optishot can develop bad habits because you may have to alter your swing slightly to hit a good shot on the simulator. The first time I played on my local golf course after using the Opitshot was not what I expected. My swing was different because of the Optishot and it took me 7 holes to return to my normal swing. I then shot +1 on the reaming holes for an 81.In conclusion, I don't think the Optishot is worth the money for low handicap player. It is more of a glorified toy. However I can see the usefulness of this simulator for others, but it just wasn't for me. 2 stars out of 5.",2.0,Useful for Beginners- Not Worth the Money for Advanced Golfers,1363910400,"03 22, 2013",Sports_and_Outdoors,"{'CS': 0.582844132, 'MNR': 0.0, 'RB': 0.0, 'RC': 1.0, 'PR': 100.0, 'NR': 0.0, 'FR': 0.0, 'RSP': 0.0, 'AW': 0.0, 'RD': 1.897959184, 'RL': 2739.0, 'ER': 0.0, 'PC': 0.873563218}",0.0

I was also drawn to the length of the cable and the price which was half of the cost of the adapter alone. My disappointment was when I went to plug in the HDMI connector to the back of the tv.

Finch ""NTFinch""","[20.0, 21.0]","I am not disappointed with the Time Capsule, but am disappointed with some of the consequences associated with having it.  First, let me say that it offers a lot more customization than most people are willing to admit.  The network settings and ability to customize your network are just as good if not better than every other router I have owned.-The USB sharing works like a champ.  I am currently sharing two hard drives and a printer from the USB port.  I don't like that the drives won't mount to the desktop, but rather just show up like a shared folder.  It works though, so I have no real complaint.-Time Machine works well, although you can't transfer a hard drive with an existing TM backup to the Time Capsule.  You have to format and start over, which sucks.-The TC is a bit noisy, but no more than the quietest hard drives I have used.  It is definitely not as noisy as a Lacie or similar.-As of right now, I cannot connect my XBOX 360 to the TC.  I suspect that this is a flaw in the XBOX wireless adapter, and not in TC.  I will try hooking up an old router in bridge mode and see if I can get it to work that way.  I have also heard that there is a Linksys Wireless-N Gaming Adapter that works both with XBOX and with Airport Extreme-It is a bit large, but looks great.  I have heard others say it gets hot, but mine hasn't become anything more than warm.-I have experienced what others say is slow performance, but I have been told that the Time Capsule regulates network traffic depending what it is, which usually only applies to Time Machine.  It won't allow Time Machine backups slow down your network, which I like.

After unpacking it, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and the appearance of the umbrella. Even the zippered outer protective shell which incases the umbrella looks of quality. The zipper is that of good construction and stamped with the wording London Fog and there is also a cloth tag with the wording London Fog. The handle is made of wood and it is stamped with black lettering which says London Fog. There is a silver colored metal collar above the handle and includes the automatic open and close button which is nicely done. There is also an elastic black band attached to the collar of the handle to be used as a wrist band. The automatic open and close mechanism works flawlessly. This umbrella does not appear to be one of those typical cheap flimsy type of umbrellas. The umbrellas brackets and braces are made out of plastic and metal and seem to be fairly well designed. The canopy is also of a decent size. Compared to all of the other compact umbrellas that I have had, this one by far beats them all. Also, this compact umbrella is far from being small when opened, it has a nice size canopy. You just might be able to fit two people under it. I think though that it is better suited for one person. I am very satisfied with this purchase and as of right now, I would buy it again. I haven't been able to test it in adverse weather conditions, when that time comes my review could change, we will see what happens. My initial take on this umbrella although is one of a positive nature. Update, today I was able to test the umbrella to see how it would perform in the rain. It was a little breezy with light rain. There was no issue with the wind, the umbrella performed okay. As far as the rain is concerned, the umbrella did it's job to keep me dry.

Interior HD antennas are a joke to say the least most are not as good as rabbit ears, I had tried a few with no success over the years.I saw on another post one could go to [...] to find out where the broadcast towers are&#8230; in my case the broadcast towers are 35 to 40 miles away with a one tower being 10 miles to the right of the main towers.  Because there is separation I can&#8217;t use a highly directional antenna. Generally the longer the range an antenna is the more directional an antenna becomes. After reading plenty of reviews this Channel Master 2016 antenna seemed ideal for my application. It also help it had few returns. Most of the other brands people complained a lot and had a lot of returns. Most issues I would say was due to poor application, buying a highly extended range antenna means more adjusting to find a tower. I have an exterior roof mount with 65 feet of coax to my television.

I got the package and the box was badly beat up and taped all over the place. I kept my fingers crossed and hid the box until tonight (Christmas Eve). Upon opening the box and starting to put together, my husband told me that one of the training wheels was missing. When I came down to check, I saw that the bike was not pink, but BLUE! I checked my account thru Amazon and this bike showed up. I knew I did not order the blue bike because I was not fond of the color, its not bad, just not what I wanted. So I checked my email confirmation and sure enough, the PINK bike in 16 inch was what I ordered. Out of curiosity I clicked the link and it came up on the BLUE 16 inch bike. So basically, the pink does not exist in 16 inch, only 12 inch. I noticed Amazon has since fixed this. But, as Christmas is a few hours away, I can't exactly do anything. This is her big gift and she has been asking Santa for a bike like crazy. So, not only do I have to explain the missing training wheel, now I have to  figure out what to do about this bike.

It's been a real workhorse and has been restrung many times.When I saw that Ektelon released a larger, lighter version, I knew it was time for a change. The old Toron weighs in at a whopping 250g and delivers a fair amount of power, it's just a bit hard to get a good snap on the ball at times and the extra weight puts more stress on my arm.My impression of the new EXO3 RG Toron Lite is very favorable. It weighs in at a svelte 195 grams, has a much larger sweet spot and swings much easier. The extra bit of reach has allowed me to snag balls I would have ordinarily missed and has made my back wall play much more consistent.The new, tacky grip took a bit of getting used to since I've been using leather pretty much since day 1, but it's growing on me quickly. Shifting the racquet for backhands is a bit trickier because of the extra friction and only affected my play for a couple of games.I'm astonished how much of a difference 55 grams has made in my play. I wish I'd picked this up much sooner.Followup after a couple months use (May  14):I'd read a review about fragility, but haven't had any issues in spite of banging off the wall more than a few times. I'm sure it's possible to break the racquet, but it seems at least as sturdy as my original Toron.I'm still very happy with the racquet, especially when using the Ektelon red balls.",5.0,Excellent Racquet,1394064000,"03 6, 2014",Sports_and_Outdoors,"{'CS': 0.731626437, 'MNR': 0.142857143, 'RB': 1.0, 'RC': 129.0, 'PR': 80.62015504, 'NR': 9.302325581, 'FR': 0.093023256, 'RSP': 0.0, 'AW': 4032.0, 'RD': 0.571428571, 'RL': 1509.0, 'ER': 1.0, 'PC': 1.732673267}",0.0

Your price may vary, see dealer for details....  ;)I went through 14 different vendors/brands and only found FOUR that were 1800mAh or above, the rest were counterfeit. What does counterfeit mean?

I'm a serious photographer, so I'm really picky about the quality of my optics.  Normally, I don't have a problem paying money for good optics, but unfortunately I'm on a bit of a budget at the moment.The mounting hardware I found a little puzzling.  The instructions don't seem to state how tightly they should be torqued,  There's definitely a gap between the half's, but I'd be very reluctant to tighten them all the way down.The turrets turn crisply and have a nice little ring for locking them... Major plus.  I was impressed that the unit came with two batteries, another thumbs up.  The caps and sunshades appear reasonably rugged and require a bit of effort to remove, which is a good thing in my opinion.The only thing that I have to say is a bit of a disappointment is the clarity of the reticle.  When simply leaving it powered off, it looks good.  You can definitely separate the dots from the cross hair.  However, once you turn it on, that's where things get a little meh.All three brightness's of red, it's pretty difficult to separate the dots from the lines.  The greens are difficult, too.  I had better luck with the blues.  My only real gripe about the illumination is that it's rather difficult to differentiate between the highest and lowest brightness settings on both red and green.  Blue is a little better.Just an observation here, but I'm thinking that of all the colors, blue might be easier on eyes readjusting to the darkness, if shooting in low light situations.

The foam comes with a mattress topper that you insert the foam in. The topper seems sturdy and keeps the foam fairly well centered on bed. The topper can travel an inch from center, but that is about it. I don't wake up in the middle of the night needing to turn and I don't have any back problems.

I figured in the long run this was the cheaper alternative.  I gave the alarm three stars as it did everything it was advertised to do and the set-up couldn't have been easier.  However, after setting it up I realized that the people who reviewed this alarm must have never owned one before, because the system is missing basic functionality which was all present on my previous system.1.) When the system is armed it does not tell you if any windows are open.  Ergo, you could arm the system and think everything is fine but have rendered it useless as the thief comes through the window you left open.  Unless you live alone and know exactly what was opened it's a pain to have to go to each room to check before you arm the alarm.2.) The system does not tell you in any sensors are unoperational.  Eventually the batteries on these things fail (after about 2yrs from my experience), or you accidentally knock it off a window or door without noticing.  So it's the same situation as above, you arm it and think everything's fine when multiple sensors might not be working.3.) There is no delay on the sensors.  While the siren should go off immediately if any windows or front doors are tripped, there should be a 45 second delay on the back door so you can walk in and punch in the code. This is not possible with this system.  They do give you these handy key-chains, which are actually easier, as you can disarm it before opening the door.  But what if you misplace them or have guests? It would be nice to have the option to disarm it by hand.4.) The main panel can't be put on silent.  Whatever you do, don't put this system near a bedroom, the chirp when arming the system is loud and you can't get up before someone, leave, and re-arm the system without waking them up.So, yes, the alarm does everything it says it will, but if I were you I'd get something else.

I had about a quarter of the ice left in the bottom.  Sunday night, I drove back home and that ice was gone.  It lasted my three days, sort of.  But on day 4, there wouldn't have been any ice left.

I bought the SAME EXACT plane from Toys R Us but know that more people will see the review on Amazon's siteI had purchased the Spitfire version and on bringing it home to my son who loves all things to do with airplanes started setting it up. When I got to the part where you insert the battery into the plane just a small push ripped the front of the plane off so it was hanging like a hinge. The plane is made from a very weak styrofoam and I cannot tell you how angry I was. This was Christmas Day 2012 and my son was so excited about getting it out of the box. I had to rush and get some masking tape to hold the pieces together which proved to be a good temporary measure. After that I set it all up and thus began the flight. The plane took off and the flight was amazing until it just stopped mid air and fell to the ground. The battery had come loose on the plane, I pushed it back in and started again. Again the plane just dropped out of the air, the battery had come loose again. This happened time and time again at which point the enjoyment was lost and fustration had kicked in.I returned the plane to exchange for another hoping the new one would be different, maybe the first one was a manufacturing reject that somehow got through the screening process. The replacement was amazing, had non of the faults of the previous plane and it worked an entire evening. My son was so happy and so was I, but I had spoken to soon. The next evening after a couple of good flights during which the propeller is designed to break off in any bad landing to prevent damage, I pushed the propellor onto it's coupling like I had done numerous times already and it caved in thus preventing me from reattaching the propeller again. There was no fix for this, the plane was done. Another result of using styrofoam for the main fuselage.The real shame is that this is an amazing concept and when it work, it worked really well making it very enjoyable for young and old. It just seems the manufacturer is making maximum profit with very very cheap materials. Also when it says complete flight system it does NOT include a secondary plane for the price you are paying. I found that to be unbelievable when the price of this toy was so high. So you're saying I have to spend close to $200 and own two whole kits before I can play combat with my son.

It does come mostly assembled, and the set up instructions are fairly easy to follow (though the instructions indicate that the safety pin is on the left, it's actually on the right - at least on mine it is. Several of the knobs were damaged and/or broken during shipment, and there are some scrapes and scratches in places. The monitor is easy to read, and they did at least think to put a holder for a water bottle or a TV remote on it as well. The handles are long, which seems safe. It doesn't make too much noise when you're on it, so if you were listening to music or watching TV or someone else is in the room, it doesn't cause too much of a disturbance.Though the picture and description indicate that there is no incline, there actually is when you set it up, and there's no way to adjust it. You'd probably have to put some books or a piece of wood or something underneath the back end to get a level walking surface, so this treadmill is probably not good for those just beginning an exercise routine because you're stuck with the incline.My biggest complaint is that the belt does not stay in the middle of the walking platform. It slides one way or the other. I've tried to adjust it, but it simply won't stay permanently in the middle.

Honing (sharpening) with a butcher's steel does keep the blade somewhat sharp--but not like a good sharpening on a stone would do. Since they don't last very long it may be wiser to purchase lower priced knives and replace them more often--that's what I'm looking for now. BTW most internet sites use honing and sharpening interchangeably (see Wikipedia and Consumer Reports). The material and tool actually make the difference. I have solely used a butcher's steel on the Henkels serrated utility knife (and delicately at that).",2.0,Favorite but with Reservation,1195689600,"11 22, 2007",Home_and_Kitchen,"{'CS': 0.568782259, 'MNR': 0.0, 'RB': 0.0, 'RC': 8.0, 'PR': 62.5, 'NR': 37.5, 'FR': 0.0, 'RSP': 0.0, 'AW': 2163.0, 'RD': 2.805555556, 'RL': 842.0, 'ER': 0.0, 'PC': 1.156069364}",0.0

Roll a die, move your pawn, answer a question. Questions come in 4 flavors. You have Left and Right Brain questions, which as far as I can tell are not different in any way. Third is 'Spot the Liar' which is a 50/50 shot at a right answer. These questions are written so badly the true answer is always extremely obvious. ""How did this Historic person die? A) Poisoned by a lover or B) Bats trained by a wicked witch drained him of all his blood"" Hum I wonder which of those could be made up. Lastly you have ""Enlightening Round"" cards. With these you must answer 3 questions just to get one point. Then you can risk that point to try to earn an extra turn. So this gives you a chance to work 3 times as hard, and get no extra bonus. FUN! You also start the game with 2 ""Mental Block"" cards that let you retry a question, or make someone lose a turn. Pro Tip kids, save these for the 50/50 Spot the Liar questions.

The quick summary is that it works, I&#8217;m OK with it, but I prefer my Max Burton unit by a wide margin.This unit tries to be too much without being really good at anything.  More specifically, the controls are poor.  The fact is that this thing should be a great burner before trying to add complexity.

I want much smaller steps because none of these set temperatures are quite right.  Also &#34;sear&#34; at 160F?Or&#8230; if you select &#8220;boil&#8221; you can select power levels P1, P2, &#8230;, P6.  I don&#8217;t know that these are all that useful.

Although this TV has been left behind by technology, there is actually nothing wrong with it - the picture and sound are as great as they always were.  It sits in our basement entertainment center, connected to an old DVD player, and an even older VCR.  I mainly used it for exercise videos and to allow my grandchildren to watch movies without disturbing the entire house.However I thought we could get better use from the Old Sony and wanted to use it for streaming Amazon Instant videos.  I didn't know exactly how to accomplish this, so I took it to my local office store and asked one of their computer tech guys to recommend something to convert PC to CRT, making it possible to view computer tv programs and movies on the old Sony Trinitron.  They didn't have the correct set up in the store, so we went online right at the service desk and searched Amazon for a solution.After reviewing several possibilities, we decided that this gadget would do the trick, and I ordered it online there and then.  I didn't know if it would really work, but at this price it was worth a try.  It arrived within a week, and was simple, straightforward and effective!  Everything was included, and it was all very easy to do.  The instructions were brief - they didn't need to be longwinded because the set up is so seamless and idiot - proof.  First, I found an unused input on the TV and plugged in the red/white/yellow plugs on the converter.  Then I attached the appropriate connections to my laptop and turned everything on.  Voila!  The TV became and instant computer monitor and speaker for my computer.  I proceeded to play a movie on Amazon instant video and everything worked like a charm.Now when anyone in the house wants to watch a computer movie on a big TV screen, all they have to do is connect to this great and inexpensive converter!  The flat screen TV we have in the family room will do this without a converter, but who wants the whole house filled with the noise of movies and TV programs playing all the time.  It is nice to have a place that is not so central where people can watch programs without disturbing everyone in the house.  And I like having access to the exercise videos that are available online.This is everything I like in a computer device - it is simple and reliable.

If you want to see a wide expanse of nature or the heavens downrange from your position, these are the way to go.  I got them specifically to frame smaller constellations and asterisms, the detail of which can be further examined with a scope.  They help tremendously to put the object in the scope into context.  Ordinarily, observing half a degree of field tends to abstract objects almost entirely from their surrounding.  Since it's not practical to really ""zoom"" in using a single optical instrument, using these in combination with something of higher power is ideal.  Don't get me wrong, I do have a zoom on the scope... it zooms from 25x to 50x -- amazing but you have to understand that this is a field of view of 2.4 to 1.5 degrees -- essentially like looking through a pipe to a drinkstraw.  These Nikons however, show over 9 degrees field of view -- something which is unsurpassed in the highest-end binocular out there.There are compromises necessitated by the optical principles used to make these function.  They do not have a very flat field of view, meaning objects in the center of the field (circle) can be focused, but objects nearer the edge of the field are out of focus.  This is because the focused field is curved not flat.  This problem is also evident in most 10x50's for example.  It's less of a problem in good quality 8x42's like Nikon's Monarch for example, and obviously the high end Swarovski, Leica, Zeiss etc.  This problem matters more when you have a narrow field and highly magnified image where the subject tends to fill the field of view.  It matters less when the subject is focused in the center of the field and the background surrounding it is slightly out of focus.Still, even if you pay the biggest bucks for bright, flat, and sharp images from the top of the line binoculars, you'll still only see about 8 degrees true field of view, whereas these give you over 9 degrees.  Furthermore, they give an apparent field of view of over 59 degrees, rivaling the top-of-the-line binoculars.If you're looking for a handy, all-purpose binocular, the roof-prism 8x42's are proven to be far more popular for a number of good reasons (more compact, more magnification while not yet needing a tripod or IS like 10x does, more competition and choices etc.)  But if you're looking for the best field of view with high quality optics, this is it, and fortunately it comes at a very reasonable cost.  I don't know what other 7x35's are out there, but I can tell you this is far better than Celestron or Bushnell.",5.0,Field of View,1351555200,"10 30, 2012",Sports_and_Outdoors,"{'CS': 0.762867843, 'MNR': 0.0, 'RB': 0.0, 'RC': 103.0, 'PR': 43.68932039, 'NR': 37.86407767, 'FR': 0.13592233, 'RSP': 0.0, 'AW': 2943.0, 'RD': 0.470588235, 'RL': 2612.0, 'ER': 1.0, 'PC': 0.331125828}",0.0

Prior to owning this unit, we owned the original Bose Acoustic Wave Machine. When we purchased the original version, it was priced similar to what this one is priced at. At the time, and even when I purchased this one, I felt that the price was justified for the high quality performance that the system delivered. My feeling is that the high price of the original unit, as well as this one when it was first released, was justified because of the years and years of research that Bose put into the design of such a marvelous device. Now, since it's been almost 30 years since the original version was first produced, Bose should realize that prices for electronics have come down. The Acoustic Wave music system ll is very similar to the original version. The way I look at it is this. If you purchase a High Definition TV today, you'll end up paying about 75% less than you paid for a similar TV just 6 years ago, yet the TV you buy today will be a lot better. The same applies to most consumer electronics. With the Bose Acoustic Wave music system ll, you're basically getting the same thing that you would have, had you purchased the device when it was first introduced back in the 1980's. Yes, there have been some improvements and additions, but none that would justify the price being kept so artificially high.There is no question that the performance of the Bose Acoustic Wave Music System II is phenomenal. Compared with much larger systems with separate speakers, the Bose performs admirably. On this scale, it definitely deserves 5 stars. If you've never listened to it before, you'll be astounded that such a small music system could put out such incredible sound. Even in a very large room, the sound produced by this device is nothing short of phenomenal. It has rich bass, and crisp mid range and treble. It's truly astounding when you hear it for the first time. The problem is that there are other companies that are producing similar systems for a fraction of what Bose charges. They may not be quite as good, but at a price of less than half of what you pay for the Bose system, you could purchase one from a different manufacturer that would sound almost as magnificent as this one does.The bottom line is that this device gets 5 stars for performance and 1 star for price.

However, and for some strange and unknown reason, those extended batteries tend to cause a problem!!!!! After using the battery for about 5 minutes or so, my HTC Sensation XE froze for the first time ever!!  I actually had to remove the battery, and insert it again in order to restart the phone. Was that a coincidence? I don't think so, because about a year ago, I faced similar problem with my HTC Desire HD when using a 3rd party, high capacity battery which I also got form Amazon. That problem with my Desire HD happened 2 times within 10 minutes timeframe, which got me worried thinking that it could damage my phone, so I stopped using that battery, and reused the original HTC battery without any problem.Anyway, and back to my Sensation XE with the Anker 1900mAh battery; the freezing problem happened again after an hour or so, however. this time the screen went totally black!  And again I had to remove and reinsert the battery.  I decided to try the new Anker battery for longer time, and see what happen.  So a day later, the battery didn't cause the phone to freeze, instead, to restart itself!!I am in the 4th day now, and that problem seems to vanish which is a good news, well, so far at least. The strange thing is that I also purchased a1800mAh extended battery made by Mugen for my son's HTC Desire S, and his phone also froze (for the first time) within 5 minutes after using the new battery.  He also had to remove and reinsert the battery in order to restart the phone.  By now, I am sure you agree with me that this cannot be a coincidence!!It's also the 4th day for my son, and the good news so far is that problem did not happen again with his Desire S.  He is also reporting that he is noticing much better battery life with the new 1800mAh Mugen battery, even though it is still at the 3rd charge/recharge cycles.

Although I knew the route I wanted to travel I also wanted to test out my new device so I loaded in my destination and took off. Well the GPS kept directing to get off the highway, (fastest route) and take a route which would have me going through city streets and hitting all the traffic signals etc. It was directing me to do this all the way to my destination but since I knew the route I didn't follow the device's recommendation. After I arrived at my destination I checked the settings and they were correct,or so I thought, I had chosen fastest route and the avoidance's were set for traffic, unpaved roads, U-turns and car pool lanes. On the way back to the airport I bit the bullet and followed the device's instructions, BIG MISTAKE!!! I was routed to a road which took me on an 18 mile trek through heavily congested business districts with many, many traffic signals and many, many trucks cars etc. It added at least 30-45 minutes to my trip plus a lot of anxiety. I contacted the Garmin customer support center when I got home and explained my problem, I was told by the first rep that there was nothing wrong with my device and that was ""just the way it is"" not accepting that answer I told them there was a problem with the device's logic for it to route me the way it did and I was still not satisfied with the device. After a couple of days and a different rep I finally got a rep who seemed to know something he told me the avoidance for traffic would tend to take me off highways because they are usually heavily traveled which made no sense to me because I also had the fastest route as a preference, but the rep said to try it so I've removed all the avoidance's and will give it another shot but I'm still not a happy camper.Update to my earlier review. We just took a trip to Niagara Falls,Canada and then on to Toronto. We flew to Buffalo from Boston then drove to the falls,the Garmin worked better,only one screw up when it took us off the highway leading to the border crossing and we immediately got the ""recalculating"" message even though we took the route it directed us to take. Other than that one error it worked great, so to anyone considering this unit I would say to dis-able the avoidance's in the tools settings and you should be OK.Update to my update, we recently were in Clifton Park, NY and wanted to get to the Mass. Turnpike in Lee, Mass. I've traveled this route several times but I wanted my 1450LMT to pick my route so I followed it's suggestion and it failed again. Instead of the route my old Nuvii 250 always suggested, (also Google suggested) which was US 87 to NY 7 to US 787 the to I-90 the 1450LMT directed me to NY route 9 which is 6 minutes longer (per Google) and a route which took us through business and residential areas with numerous traffic signals etc. This unit has serious logic problems which Garmin engineers can't or won't fix. Anyone contemplating purchasing a GPS would be advised to steer clear of Garmin products. I'm sorry I wasted my money on this piece of junk.

I took care not to spray my device with the supplied solution and only sprayed the sticky side of the clear shield.  This did a good job of deactivating the stick yet any area not wet maintained a strong adhesion.  I used 2 sprays to cover the entire sticky surface and applied it to my phone.  I used the supplied squeegee to work out any bubbles and move the liquid under the shield towards the edge where I had a paper towel set to soak up anything that came out.  Some of this solution managed to work its way under the screen showing as a large blob about twice the size of a quarter.  I left the phone without a battery for 4 days and went so far as to place it in a zip-lock with a silica packet from a left over electronics purchase (hoping this would draw out some of the moisture).  Nothing changed and on the 4th day I opted to fire it up to see if the problem persisted.  The touch screen is completely dead.  I contacted Zagg customer service and was instructed to remove the protector to see if the device was broken.  I did this and found that my screen was in fact dead.

I knew the Impossible Project had created film, but it's about $23.00 for eight shots.  They're incredibly vivid and look amazing, but my budget couldn't handle the high cost.  I was very close to purchasing the Fujifilm Instax 7s, but I was unsure of the small, credit card size of the pictures.  After doing a little bit more research, I found that there was the Fujifilm Instax 200 and 210.Appearance: Yes, it's huge.  After spending days looking through size comparisons, I figured it wouldn't be too big.  When I received it, I thought the packaging was ridiculously big, but I then realized upon opening the box that I was met with something larger than my face.  The plastic is also very flimsy.  Looking through the camera, I noticed that one drop could be fatal, so I keep it in a camera bag.  I was hoping that I could possibly fit my small point and shoot with it too, but it's impossible.  Also, be very careful with removing the plate for changing batteries.  I almost broke the little hook that snaps it in place.Features: The ability to turn flash off or on made it for me.  The lens that comes with it for portraits is also a great feature.  I decided to take a picture with and without the lens, and it's definitely noticeable.  However, I tried doing a double exposure, and I found it to be impossible.  If I find a way to do so, I will definitely update.  I generally leave the settings on normal with 3m~infinity, and it takes great pictures.Sound: You know the sound of a Polaroid once you take the picture?  It's loud and impossible to bring to small gatherings or quiet venues.  I was surprised that once I took the picture, I heard a very low motor noise and nothing else.Pictures: They really are beautiful.  I've mostly used them indoors, and I'm very impressed with the quality.  I'm really loving the wide screen photographs as well.  As usual, I spend the first ten photographs just to learn how the settings work.  I would recommend this product more for outdoor shots, whether a little overcast or sunny.  There's something about the way the pictures are that makes them seem almost surreal.  I say this because whenever I take a picture indoors and I have to use flash, the images turn out flat.Price: The camera on its own is roughly $65.00.  It's a bit steep considering early models of point and shoot digital cameras are the same price.  But if you're purchasing this camera, you're doing it because you miss or want to learn about instant film.  There's something magical about a picture being produced before your eyes.  It's something tangible, one of a kind, and you almost feel like you're able to grasp moments of your own life.  It's sentimental yet functional.  I was very surprised by the price of the film.  If you buy ten pack, you will spend about $85.00.  Each shot is roughly $0.85, a steal considering you're getting a large photograph.  I remember paying $25.00 for a double pack for 600 film.  It still isn't cheap, but it's a major difference.Overall, I am very happy with my purchase.After a very happy year with my camera, it died from water damage.  I purchased another one for a friend, and his died from dropping.  So beware, these are very fragile.  While I wish they would make a sturdier camera, it would increase the price, and I like the price point it's at right now.  I am definitely going to buy another one (I have at least fifteen packs left).I LOVE the macro lens it comes with as well.  The flash can be a little too much, so I just use a couple pieces of tape to diffuse the light.While I do love this camera and film, I did purchase some Impossible Project film for my SX-70 and 680.  The film (from 2011 - mid 2012) is really tricky sometimes.  However, the quality is a lot different than the Instax film.  In some ways better, because pictures come out so dreamy.  In some ways worse, because I have gone through a lot of film with horrible results.  It all depends on what you have the patience (and money) for.

This thing was HUGE. I don't even think my regular size of 36 F would have fit judging by how big the cups were. I know there isn't a very firm standard size for bras between different manufacturers but I was a bit surprised. The band was also a smidgeon tight on me, but probably true to size (this, too, seems to vary from brand to brand).When I was searching for bras, I could not find a back view of this particular one. I was worried that it would be thick in front and the sides and thin out to a one or two clasp back piece, but the thing really is pretty sturdy with at least three clasps (maybe four? I can't recall exactly as I've already returned it). I can see why this is a popular bra for larger busted women who really need the extra support, especially if it's strapless! It does have thin jelly threads through the inside of the bra which is meant to cling to your skin so it doesn't move around. It seemed a little bulky to me but perhaps some of that had to do with it being way too big on me.. but it might not work on some very low cut dresses or tops (in the front or back) because of how much area it covers on your body.The bra came in a standard plastic package in the mail.. I was confused by this because the bra is somewhat firm and made to hold a specific shape, it's not as if it's flimsy, but by the time it arrived here the cups of the bra had been flattened in the mailing process. They should really ship bras with firm material and a shelf (as opposed to thin fabric and underwire) in a box so that they don't arrive wrinkled and deformed. The fabric it's made of isn't anything really special, but it's not disappointing either.

All this stuff needs to be in good condition, clean, lubed, and adjusted properly.  One fly in the ointment and shifting and even pedaling may be noticeably and negatively effected.There are so many factors in problems with bicycle drivetrains that I have to read some of the less-favorable reviews for these and other similar cassettes with a grain of salt.Skipping, bad/slow/missed shifts, noises, and other problems can come from many sources.Often just replacing one part like this and expecting a magic bullet to fix all your ills is a bit short-sighted.  If your old cassette was bad it's almost a certainty that the chain was bad too.  Chains wear out faster than cassettes -but a worn out chain will grind away the favorite cogs of a cassette in short order.  Replacing a worn out cassette and not replacing the chain will cause the problem to come back in short order.  A worn-out cassette will also chew up a new chain in short order too!It's a good idea, if you are not an experienced bicycle mechanic to review Sheldon Brown's excellent articles on bicycle drivetrains and derailleur adjustments.  Do a websearch for ""Sheldon Brown Derailleur Adjustment"" and just keep reading that page and other linked pages on the Harris Cyclery Website until you have more of the big picture of what you are up against here with modern indexed-shifting systems.If you are getting a cassette with a bigger largest cog for a lower low gear be aware that you may need to adjust your B-tension screw to keep the derailleur off of the cassette.  This is a mistake a lot of people make and can cause serious damage to the chain, cassette and derailleur -even bend the derailleur hanger on the frame if it jams up and/or do serious damage to your wheel.  Know what you are doing here please.  Us bicycle mechanics really do not enjoy seeing people bring in mangled bikes and having to tell them that the cost to fix the mess will probably cost more than a new bike. Also, be aware that a larger biggest-cog may require you to run a longer chain or risk derailleur damage if the Large/Large cog/chainwheel combination is ever selected (not a good idea to cross-chain like this but still the chain should be able to do it should a mistake happen.)In my opinion the only downside of this cassette (and any decent bargain cassette for that matter) is a small-medium weight penalty.  More expensive units will weigh much less -and may shift slightly better, but not too much -the most important thing in indexed shifting is a high-quality cable and housing followed by a good high-quality indexed shifter lever/brifter.  But don't forget proper adjustment of all the components being essential also for everything to work well together.  The skill-set necessary to do this is beyond many home bicycle mechanics, at least for the first couple attempts until they learn the tricks.The tools needed to remove this cassette are a cassette locking tool such as:Park Tool Cassette/Rotor Lockring Removal Tool - FR-5/FR-5G a wrench capable of holding the tool, and a chain whip like this:Park Tool HCW-16 Chain Whip/15mm Pedal Wrench.  It's not a hard job to physically remove and re-install the cartridge.  If your bike was working well when you swapped it should be fine with maybe a small adjustment of the cable to account for small manufacturing tolerances.  If you put a bigger largest cog on you will need to adjust the B-tension screw for more clearance.BEFORE ORDERING:  Check your derailleur rating by searching for it here on amazon to be sure that it is rated for a larger cog than you have.  Most Shimano medium-cage derailleurs are rated for 27-tooth max but you can usually get away with 28.  30 might be iffy.  30+ tooth largest cogs really need to have a mountain derailleur with a long cage and not a medium-cage (or small cage) road derailleur.Sorry if this review seems super-long but there is a lot of material here to cover.  Good luck with your new cassette, riding should be fun and there is nothing wrong with wanting your bike to shift well and be geared for your type of riding.",5.0,This is a good budget 9-speed cassette,1336435200,"05 8, 2012",Sports_and_Outdoors,"{'CS': 0.792082519, 'MNR': 0.111111111, 'RB': 1.0, 'RC': 139.0, 'PR': 81.29496403, 'NR': 6.474820144, 'FR': 0.258992806, 'RSP': 0.0, 'AW': 1926.0, 'RD': 0.8125, 'RL': 4485.0, 'ER': 1.0, 'PC': 1.608944641}",0.0

Not wanting to rely on Comcast's CableCards for High Definition network feeds I pulled out an old RCA antenna to pick up the OTA signals. The results were okay, but not consistent. Some channels come in crystal clear. Some macroblock every couple seconds. And for some reason I can't seem to pick up the local CBS affiliate's HD channel at all (not that I watch much on CBS, but it's the principle of the thing). After a few months of reading reviews and looking at other antennas at Best Buy & Fry's I finally pulled the trigger on the Terk HDTVa hoping it would be the solution I was looking for.When it showed up and I opened up the box those doubts immediately began to creep in my head. First off, the HDTVa is huge. Much bigger than I was expecting it to be. And ugly. I knew what it looked like and I get what they were going for from a design standpoint, but this thing stands out like a sore thumb, especially if you're trying to partner it with an elegantly designed flat-panel TV. As other reviews have stated, the footprint of the antenna is pretty small and as a result you can knock this over pretty easily. The coaxial cable coming out of the bottom doesn't help either. As I was putting it together, on top of my own dislike for it's design, I thought my girlfriend was not going to stand for this jutting out from behind the TV. Still I thought I needed to see how it performed before I made any decision.I hooked everything up and checked the signals coming through the Tivo. The results were just about the same as the RCA rabbit ears. Some channels were clear. Some had drop outs every few seconds. Still nothing at all coming through for CBS. We're in the Western Suburbs of Chicago, only about 14 miles from the broadcast towers, so it's not like we're straining to pick up a signal. Adjusting the antenna didn't seem to make much of a difference for the better. Either the signal strength stayed the same or dropped. When my girlfriend came home it took her a while, but when she finally noticed the antenna, she gave me a look that said ""what the hell is that thing doing in here.""After a few days I disconnected the Terk and packed it back in its box and reconnected the RCA. If the Terk's performance had been rock solid, it might have made up for its lack of looks. It wasn't, so I went back to the less intrusive antenna.I'm sure that it works perfectly for some people and the design doesn't bother everyone. But in my case it's not the be-all, end-all I had hoped it would be and so it goes back. If you're looking to use this with a flat screen Plasma/LCD/DLP, I wouldn't bother unless you can expertly tuck it away somewhere.It amazes me that, in the age of the iPod, a TV antenna hasn't been reduced to the size of a computer mouse that could be inconspicuously placed next to or on top of your TV set and works without constant fiddling.Time to start looking for something else...",3.0,"Decent, but not spectacular",1199664000,"01 7, 2008",Electronics,"{'CS': 0.749635978, 'MNR': 0.0, 'RB': 0.0, 'RC': 2.0, 'PR': 50.0, 'NR': 0.0, 'FR': 0.0, 'RSP': 0.0, 'AW': 0.0, 'RD': 0.878182726, 'RL': 2993.0, 'ER': 0.0, 'PC': 3.375}",0.0

The people who rated this poorly must be using it wrong.  You can't expect a 15.00 blender to handle large hunks of ice to begin with.  Nutribullet struggled with ice as I tried two of them, the 600 and 900 watt models.  I have been using this Hamilton Beach single serve blender every day for over a month now and it is great.  I put my liquid in first (6 to 8 ounces), then add partially frozen fruit, crushed ice (just a little), protein powder, banana, ground flax seed, spinach, and honey, and it works wonderfully.  Just as good as did the Nutribullet which cost 80.00 to 150.00!!  Plus, it makes very little noise and you take the entire blender cup with you, with cover attached (just stick in a straw), and off you go.  Clean up is a snap, just one item.  Don't believe what you read with the negative reviews.  They try it once and are disappointed, yet they probably didn't add enough liquid, or too much ice, etc.  You do it right and you have the best 15.00 blender, worth way more.  Plus it comes with a year warranty.  Try it more than once.  You have to experiment to get the right ratios and then you will love this blender for one serving size.  Also, it is soooo quiet that you can use it and not have to worry about waking someone up.

I outgrew the Onkyo because I ran out of optical ports, and it did not support HDMI.Do not buy this if you plan to use it with a TV!  Read more to understand the problems with this design:1 - If your TV does not have a fiber optical out, you will not have any way to connect your TV sound to the sonos.  I do have an optical cable from the TV, but so does my DVR, my blu Ray player, and my Apple TV.  SONOS has One input, and that is not enough.  (This is why they created receivers with many inputs.)  Some people say that you can switch this through your TV, better make sure that your TV supports this.2 - Almost all modern receivers support HDMI switching, and video processing to improve color and resolution.  Incoming picture from the cable company is terrible because they compressed it and scrambled it.  These modern receivers restore the picture to full quality by up converting to 1080p, and doing color correction.  SONOS does not have any way to improve the picture quality.3 - Wireless?  Really?  It still requires a optical connection to the TV and a power connection.  For $400 less, my Onkyo receiver also requires an wired connection to the receiver and wall outlet.  The receiver provides a lot more benefit.4 - SONOS sound bar cost $700.  I bought an Onkyo TX-NR717 from amazon for $490, and it does HDMI up conversion on all connected devices (DVR, DVD, AppleTV, VCR, etc), supports every surround sound spec ever invented, supports iPAD/iPHone integration, Network Music, and the list goes on and on...  SONOS gives us 1 optical input... that's it, nothing else.  How long before you outgrow this system?  Maybe you have outgrown it before you even buy it!5 - Sonos requires that you buy, build, and maintain a proprietary wifi network for it to operate.  Each bridge has a retail price of $49.  The Onkyo uses my Netgear Router and plays network music beautifully.  With Onkyo, there is no extra network to maintain, no extra work to trouble shoot and diagnose a network problem when the sonos network fails.  Look out for when you need to do a OS upgrade!6 - The onkyo setup required more work, but that is because I took advantage of all of its amazing features.  If I only used it for a center channel, left, and right speaker, then set-up would have been very easy as well.There are countless advantages that the Onkyo receiver has over a sonos sound bar. Interestingly enough, the reasons why I got rid of my 12 year old Onkyo (no HDMI ports and ran out of optical ports) are the same reasons why I returned the SONOS system.I hope that I have you thinking about these, and not just accepting the SONOS marketing hype this is running rapid.  You are truly trapped from evolving to new technologies when you are locked into a very expensive SONOS system.",1.0,"Beware.

This kept my local wired connections at the original router and gave me great wireless coverage from a central area of the house without difficult additional wiring through the house (and 100' of CAT6 ain't free).

Then I contacted Sony Style Customer Relations. It only took me four (4) calls to get the right person. Their solution was to send the machine for repair.

I like Sony equipment so why not just replace it with one that works? Sadly, that is not Sony policy. However, you can return it, wait to be reimbursed and then buy a new one. What they did not say was that I would have to fight them for another week to get them to pay for the return shipping. So, ten days later and about ten phone calls later, I can send the machine back to them (we will see if they try to mess me around after they receive it).I am so disappointed in Sony customer service that I have decided not to buy another Vaio and I will certainly think twice about buying any Sony equipment.

The little T20's are given a fighting chance by way of reasonable quality components and simple design that doesn't try to defy the laws of physics. The woofer is woven glass fiber (aka fiberglass) with a rubber surround. It's not kevlar as I had originally thought, but still something more than the plastic and cheap paper drivers found in the majority of computer speakers. Creative doesn't specify a woofer size, but it's small...likely in the 3"" range. The cloth dome tweeter has a similar appearance to many European made dome tweeters I'd tried and heard in other highend speakers over the years. Neither driver is expected to be remotely close to state-of-the-art at this price point and for this application, but they at least mimicked what the real McCoys offer. Even the placement and proximity of the drivers appear to have been conceived by an actual audio engineer as opposed to a marketing major. The drivers were as close together as physically possible, which cuts down on phase shift and offers a better sound stage to the listener. Driver placement also effects the ""sweetspot"" formed by the blending of two drivers to form a single soundwave. Locating the woofer above the tweeter makes sense, as it assumes a placement where the listener will be seated with ears at a higher level than the speakers, which will typically be the case in most desktop situations. The same logic is used with many highend home speakers that are angled back when the tweeter is located at the top of the cabinet closer to ear level. The T20's have separate knobs for on/off/volume, bass, and treble control. It's pretty obvious when the system is in the on mode because a beacon blue LED glares blindingly from the main powered speaker. The 20's also have a headphone output and auxiliary inputs. They're backed by a 12 month guarantee.The enclosures of the Creative Gigaworks T20s are small and are made of heavy plastic...not my first choice of materials but certainly understandable given the price point, size, and intended application. They are however at least impressively solid...most we looked at are featherweights, which is an indication of their poor lineage. The enclosure of the T20's is ported like many smaller speakers to offer a bit more bass punch, but to the Creative's credit, they allowed the woofer to do the bulk of the work which improves the musical accuracy of the bass notes. Interestingly, the grills are removable too, much like many higher end systems, so you can remove the grills and eliminate any possible defraction and masking of the sound. I did not venture inside the enclosure to investigate the crossover design and components. It's safe to assume it's a bare bones design with inexpensive components. Being self-amplified means that there is a pre-amplifier stage and amplifier section inside one of the enclosures that replaces the receiver of a typical stereo system. Creative states a fairly believable 14 watts RMS per speaker (measured @ 4 ohms @ 10% THD @ 150Hz - 20kHz, two channels driven). Realistically there are probably closer to 3 or 4 usable clean watts from the amp, but they'll play loud enough to mildy rock most dorm rooms. Creative also claims a more suspect frequency range of 40hz - 20khz....I'd guess more like 80hz - 20Khz, as that bottom octave isn't overly deep or prominent.Specs aside, the diminuitive T20's play with surprising clarity, sufficient volume levels in a moderate size room, lack of gross cabinet coloration, punchy reasonably well defined bass, and best of all have a pleasant midrange where the vast majority of music frequencies are found. Creative's designer have done a nice job balancing the output of the two drivers. Bass notes aren't deep and powerful and won't rattle many windows if that's what you're looking for, but it is reasonably neutral and is able to change accordingly when bass notes in the music change. The vast majority of competing speakers with little subwoofers have such hyped up bass that the sound you actually hear is largely produced by the enclosure itself and may or may not be part of the original music signal. Imagine the enclosure as a large bottle that resonates when blown across, which is exactly what many of these little sub systems do. It's intriguing to even begin to listen critically to a class of speaker that is usually downright void of anything resembling realistic high-fidelity music reproduction. The overall tonal balance leans toward the thin side which tends to make them sound just a tad ""bright"" to me, but they're really quite pleasant to listen to. Placement will actually influence the sound a bit, and of course there are always the bass/treble adjustments if needed. There's even a hint of a stereo soundstage! Their strongest attribute is the lack of glaring flaws, which is really a strongly positive comment from a critical listener remarking about computer speakers. These are not ""amazing"", ""best ever"", ""startlingly realistic"", or even remotely competitive with true high end speakers, but they are enjoyably ""not awful"", which is actually ironically complimentary in comparison to the horrid noises produced by the competition in this class speakers.As I step down from my audio purist's soap box, it's easy to recommend the Creative Gigaworks T20s for use in a PC, or other application where there's a desire to get sound that remotely resembles a good stereo system. The sound quality is head and shoulders better than most other computer speakers and even better than most portable am/fm/CD/MP3 players. Wherever they can be hooked up to a line level music signal (MP3, CD/DVD player, etc.), and a 110v outlet to power the amplifier, the T20s will do their best for you. How ""good"" they actually sound to you is subjective and is partly influenced by what else you've been exposed to, or what you're used to hearing.

The only &#8220;odd&#8221; things I saw were in very old cookbooks I had on hand.  There was no converting, but rather some amount of guesswork when a recipe called for a dollop of butter the size of a walnut.The only thing metric in my day was a short gloss over of metric measurements.  Now there is more integration on many levels, especially cookbooks.  For example, if you weigh your flour, you can be assured of a consistent recipe every time.  A cup of flour can be lightly packed, weighing much less than one firmly packed on another baking day.This Kitchen Conversion Chart makes converting temperature, weight, liquid, spoon, and cup measurements into metric a snap.  Probably most of us are a step or two away from a fridge, where this can easily be housed.  It&#8217;s magnetic and stays nicely in place.  Now if a recipe calls for a moderate 180 C, I&#8217;ll know that&#8217;s the 350 I use so often.Weights are probably the category I&#8217;ll make the most use of.  The weight section goes from 1/2 ounce (15g) to 64 ounces or 4 pounds, 1.8kg.  Most of the measurements are in the realm of what you would normally use when you are cooking.

The parts seem solid and durable. But, if you order one, be prepared for the possibility that you'll have to send it back or exchange. The neck on ours is faulty and holds the handlebars substantially crooked, so one grip is about 1.5 inches higher than the other. You can easily see this with the naked eye and it looks clearly defective, though the part is so sturdy that it couldn't have happened in shipping. There's no way I can see to make a home fix without possibly damaging the part, and I shouldn't have to anyway considering the price tag is premium for a toddler's bike. Also, whoever installed the back wheel at the factory didn't use care in matching up the threads and cranked the nut down anyway, so one side is now stripped. This is just pure laziness. I don't think the wheel will fall off, and it would last as long as my daughter will use it, but this bike should last through many hand-me-downs and if the wheel is removed too many times the entire hub will need to be replaced. Basically the assembler was careless, knew there was damage and a defect, but boxed up the bike for sale anyway. This is incredibly irritating, wastes my time and money, and guarantees I won't be buying anything else from this company sight unseen, if at all.Note: if you have no experience tinkering with bikes, you'll probably find the brake system doesn't work well and won't allow the back wheel to roll freely, and the headset (part that holds the handlebars and forks/front wheel to allow them to turn) is adjusted very poorly, so tight the handlebars take a lot of effort to turn - unacceptable. These aren't hard to fix, but you do need extra tools and time. Another note: I gave 1 star for durability because the hub threads are already stripped when it came out of the box - they won't last now. The whole bike would probably be pretty durable if it didn't have the manufacturing issues, because the parts themselves seem strong.",2.0,Quality Control Problems,1344556800,"08 10, 2012",Toys_and_Games,"{'CS': 0.0, 'MNR': 0.0, 'RB': 0.0, 'RC': 0.0, 'PR': 0.0, 'NR': 0.0, 'FR': 0.0, 'RSP': 1.0, 'AW': 0.0, 'RD': 2.857142857, 'RL': 2070.0, 'ER': 0.0, 'PC': 0.238237046}",0.0

I had to send it back right away, however, as it does not fit a 15&#34; MacBook Pro with Retina display. This surprises me. Typically any bag claiming to hold a 15&#34; laptop will hold one larger than the svelte MBPR. It was just small enough that the zipper would jam on the laptop edge while closing it. That's not acceptable. I won't let a $120 backpack destroy the appearance of a $3000 laptop.As for other aspects, the space inside was good for my use which is to carry a Fuji X-T1 with 23mm f/1.4 lens and 55-200mm lens. It could probably carry more.Other space was well suited for carrying my extras such as iPad Mini with Retina Display, pens, cables, extra batteries for the camera, etc.I wasn't impressed by the shoulder straps. They are fairly narrow. Since switching to an Incase designs compact backpack for the last year, I have become very fond of wider shoulder straps and disjunct (where the harness is attached to a piece of material at the top which is then attached to the bag rather than the harness attached directly to the bag) harness style. I could have lived with these straps, though. I rarely carry the bag for very long.Ultimately, I would have kept the bag. I wouldn't have been extremely impressed, but, it did the job.

Downes ""Cindy Downes""","[4.0, 4.0]","After using the Basis for a few days and reading the various reviews already posted, I decided that the Basis is one of those products that some will love and others will not. Therefore, I&#8217;m going to attempt to explain what I feel is the reason.First, this is more of a man&#8217;s product. It is not the kind of device that many women will willingly wear for any length of time for two reasons. One: it&#8217;s not very attractive, even if you do switch to a different color band. It&#8217;s just plain clunky looking &#8211; there&#8217;s no getting around it.  Two: It&#8217;s uncomfortable. I found it heavy and moisture got trapped under it within a day.Next, this is a good choice if you are looking to replace a watch with a device that motivates you to keep fit. It provides motivation to take more steps and develop good sleep habits. It also tracks your heart rate. On the other hand, if you do not need a watch, there are other options that do the same that will probably work as well, if not better.This device is great for most activities; however, it is NOT the device for those of us who swim for exercise. This is where I get half my exercise each week, so the fact that I can&#8217;t wear it in the pool makes this not worth the money for me. For those who do not participate in any kind of water sports, this would not be a problem.Are you looking for a calorie counter that tracks your food and exercise? This is not the device for you. This device does not measure calories for specific exercises or for food. It only tracks steps. In fact, although it says it tracks steps, you have to be swinging your arms for the device to register. If you hold onto the treadmill rails, your movements won&#8217;t track correctly. You have to be swinging your arms or using an elliptical with moving arm handles. Depending upon the kind of walking you do, this device may or may not be for you.Finally, if you have vision problems and cannot read words in low contrast, you do NOT want this device. I understand the reasoning behind the dim readout &#8211; to save energy &#8211; however, for those of us with less than best vision, this is not an option. Better for us to charge our devices more often so we can read them.That&#8217;s my take. I hope it helps.I am giving it two stars based on my needs.

I know that drinking tea is healthful, beneficial, but I don't (didn't): coffee has all it's own pleasures, but it's a bother to brew; OJ, Ocean Spray, seltzer are quick tasty thirst-quenchers.  So as long as I was buying an infuser tea mug for him, I bought one for myself.  It's definitely easy to use -- just heat water in a glass measuring cup on the beverage setting of the microwave, drop tea leaves into the infuser inside the mug, pour the almost-boiling water on top, sit back.  Mmmmm.  Notice it has a nice big handle for good grip by any size hand.  I wanted red to match the red accent clock in his otherwise neutral kitchen, but it doesn't come in red; got gray to match his backsplash tiles instead; chose soothing turquoise for myself.  BTW, he loved the gift -- said he was pleased to make one fresh serving at a time instead of a whole pot (he had thrown away his infuser ball because the leaves got squashed).  I was happy to report the reviews I had read before committing to this purchase, that the large open infuser was ideal for steeping loose leaves.  The plus for me is no longer having to deal with soggy bags -- winding the string around a spoon, squeezing out the last drops with my thumb on the label, wondering where to put it.  This construction allows you to lift the infuser to drain, set on the inverted lid, then later use the lid to keep the tea warm.

The small adapter with a USB port is great, and the single button/mic operation is a clean and attractive design.  This works for playing music from your phone via a bluetooth connection without any wired connections, and it works as a handsfree device as a relatively cheap option to factory-installed bluetooth in your car.  The main reason I bought this was to act as a handsfree bluetooth device so I could talk/listen on my phone through my car speakers when a call came in.  Sound quality is acceptable, echo cancellation works, but there does not seem to be any other noise suppression.  So, if you are driving on a highway, placement of the microphone/button is critical.The first major shortfall is that it does not autoconnect-- you need to press the button so your phone connects.  That means I need to press the button every time I start my car.  That may not seem like a big deal, but autoconnect on bluetooth headsets has been around for many years and should be standard on this device.  Because it does not autoconnect, I rarely remember to hit the button when I get in the car.  Whenever a call comes in, I can't answer since I forgot to manually connect my phone.  Also, every time I press the button to connect, it starts playing music on my iPhone, that isn't a big deal, but it is worth noting.The 2nd major shortfall is that it can only pair with one phone.  If my wife ever wants to drive my car, she won't be able to use the bluetooth handsfree from her phone.  Again, this is another standard feature with current bluetooth headsets and should be standard on this device.I'll bet that they fix these two problems on V2, and that may make it a perfect device.One other note for people who are thinking about buying this-- if your cigarette lighter does not turn off when you turn off your car, you will constantly have to unplug it so it does not drain your battery.

It's sleek and polished, but upon closer inspection, I found the case to be a bit questionable. Let's start with the pros and move onto the negatives:Pros:- Looks great- Doesn't pick up pocket lint- Variety of colors in case you get bored with the frame- No reception issues of note- Beveling/lip near the edges of the screen isn't very intrusive - it seems to provide enough of a lift to protect the screen from resting directly on a dangerous surface, but still rests comfortably on the ear- The case has button overlays the accentuate the caseCons- The case is SLIPPERY. This is the sacrifice for having a case that doesn't attract lint in your pocket, but you WILL lose your ability to grip the phone, especially when compared to the faux leather backing.- The button overlays seem to be made out of cheap material. I'm expecting the chrome paint/surface of the buttons to start peeling or wearing within a few weeks- The worst part - the interchangeable/replaceable &#34;hybrid&#34; frame is really nothing more than very cheap, very pliable, and very thin plastic &#34;frame.&#34; I'm very concerned that a drop at the right angle will cause the frame to break. If the frame does break, the primary layer will be bare, leaving a very uncomfortable and awkward edge/indentation on the sides of the phone.  Additionally, without this frame, it's very difficult to press the buttons, as the button overlays are attached to itFor $25, I was expecting a hybrid layer covering the phone and a metallic or other semi-hard frame covering the sides.  Unfortunately, it is just plastic overlaid with a near paperthin plastic frame.  Please check the pictures section for examples of the flimsiness.Overall, the case is great looking, but I definitely don't expect it to last for the life of the phone (especially if it does take a drop).  Still, $25/per case/per drop is cheaper than the $100 deductible for an insurance payout...

It is exactly as advertised, and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. It is a good everyday watch, can be worn whether you dress up or dress down, and it is not too heavy or bulky. I don't have small wrists, so I cannot attest to how it looks or feels on small/thin wrists, but for me (6', 180lbs) it is just the right size and weight. I have only had it a week but it seems to be keeping the time as well as my iPhone and any clocks I have around the house. It has a mineral face (I was looking more for sapphire but that got pricey), and I have already hit it on doorknobs a couple of times without any damage, scratches, or any other evidence that it happened.

I have assemblied two of the Polar Light Mercury/Ford kits and have found them to be challenging.  I have many years experiance asembling Monogram's stock car kits but this kit was a challenge due to some of the parts not fitting well.  The instruction sheet is very basic and you can figure out how the parts are to go together but it is best to test fit everything before gluing the part in place.  Also a trick I developed from the Monogram kit is to glue the roll cage together then let it dry on the chassis so it will fit properly (in other words use the chassis as a jig).  You don't have to glue the roll cage to chassis at that time just let it dry there.Another challenge is assembling the engines.  They give you a 427 cu in engine and a Boss 429 cu in engine on separate spruces but the instruction uses the same part numbers for each engine so you have to be very careful not to mix the parts.  The engines are not similar to each other so the parts will not fit right on the blocks.Once the chassis is assemblied with the roll cage, engine, exhaust, and drive train it is very authentic looking.  The body slips over the chassis and is held in place by the curve of body.  The decals are first rate, are easy to apply and will not bleed thru.  One tip I can give you from my research of NASCAR in the 1960s is that the sponsor decals on the front fender do not have to be in any particular order so arrange them as it pleases you.  The order changed from race to race as did the number of decals applied.So although the kit is a challenge to assembly, it produces a very nice model for you to display on a shelf.

This fold-away handle vac. stores well in my closet below the jackets.

Initially I did not think much of it since I always have back up batteries for my flash unit. However, as I kept using them I realized, the charger was not charging the batteries all the way since I could get like may be 50 flashes before they drained out! Also, the batteries will auto drain in 2-3 days! Now recently it completely stopped working and went dead. I bought another Sanyo charger (clearly I have lot of faith on the brand), really inexpensive and super light weight (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005ILYG5Q/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc;=1).

Obviously it didnt fit. I tried all the doors in my apartment, either to find out that some doors didnt have the required width on the door frame, and others to have too thick a wall. Anyways, i decide to put it on the doors with the door frame that wasnt wide enough (about 1 cm thick) and trust that since there is no mention of a required door frame, this would be fine. So i try a very careful chin up. All fine. And then i thought of giving a try on the pull ups. So very carefully i make my way up and down. All great! And with a feeling of relief and confidence, i take a sitting position, and start doing pull ups. By the time i hit my second (!) pull up, i find myself on the floor on my ass and before i know it the iron gym lands on my head as well (by the way i weigh 90 kgs). So i sit there for a couple of seconds, considering what to do. And here i am. A full 5 mins later with my ass and head aching, giving a hatefull review to this product. Im not saying it wouldnt fit on another frame. Not that it wouldnt last and fall apart. Im just saying that they should INFORM people of the required thickness of the wall or the doorframe, or include it in the cautions section!!!! So thumbs down on this product.For anyone considering buying it, if you think you meet the nevermentioned requirements to safely fit it on your door, go ahead and buy it. It will probably serve you just fine. But if you have the slightest doubt, save your money and your body parts. I am a bit overweight, so i had the necessary cushion to land on.

It is a challenge to learn to use this machine to create a good espresso drink.  It is possible though.  In fact, I have been able to make some of the best I've ever had.  I have worked as a barista for nearly 4 years and never got as good a result on the commercial models.If you are up for the challenge, there is one important thing to keep in mind:  the filters are very unforgiving.  It is crucial that your coffee is ground perfectly for espresso or you will spend hours trying to unclog the filter (a tedious process involving a device that amounts to a pin being poked one by one into dozens of holes). I had all but given up on this machine when I decided to try a prepackaged already ground espresso.  Normally I would discourage pre-ground coffee in general (due to loss in flavor) but this completely solved the clogging problem. The espresso shots were amazing.  It was the promise of that incredible crema that drew me to this brand in the first place. Finally, I got to enjoy it. You will need to experiment with the proper tamping to get the desired results. Too light and your shot will be weak. Too firm and it will clog.Foaming the milk is also a challenge.  It seems you must overfill the included pitcher so that some of the milk spills out while you're foaming. If you do you will get the most velvety foam imaginable.Is it worth it?  Given the price I might have skipped it if I had known how challenging things would be.

Since I use my iPad full time at work or play this wouldn't do.2) The standard triple fold top does have a magnet that worked quite well for sleep/wake, but something about how the leather was creased at the shell kept the top from folding into a triangle to be used as a stand or a prop.

That said, the difference in coverage area is tiny and not on a usable part of the glass anyway.  The finish is surprisingly matte, which feels a little odd, increases finger drag noise, and dulls the screen colors somewhat.  It does seem to reduce glare from overhead lights, though.  I haven't yet used it outside during the day, but I think it'd be fine.  The touch sensitivity seems fine.I can't say for sure if it's a difference between the phones or a shortcoming of these screen protectors that the protector seems about half a millimeter long on the lower end.  I aligned the upper edge to barely not cover the ear speaker, but the hole for the home button at the bottom is offset low by about half a mm, though thankfully it's big enough that it just clears the top edge of the button.  The protectors are slightly stiff and the first film I tried applying was a tiny fraction of a mm too low, so it hit the slightly raised plastic bottom edge of the phone below the glass and wouldn't adhere to the glass there.  I pulled it off and tried reapplying, but the act of picking it off the glass slightly marred an edge of the protector and introduced a few dust grains under it.  I tried again with a second film, but again got dust stuck to it while fiddling with the precise placement.  Incidentally, the &#34;smoothing card&#34; is just a small piece of paperboard.  On film number 3 I managed to get the protector high enough to not hit the bottom plastic but not so high as to cover the top speaker, and with only 1 or 2 dust particles, so I called it good enough, and a week later I can't tell where the dust particles were.  Good thing it's a 6-pack, though.  You also get two cleaning cloths, one in each 3-pack within the 6-pack package.The thing that inspired me to come write my review, though, is that I've barely used the phone in the week since I applied the screen protector (I don't even have it activated yet, so I'm not regularly carrying it in my pocket), yet there's already a big scratch down the protector.  I've been spoiled by the Zagg Invisible Shield on my old phone, and this doesn't live up to that legacy.  Sadly, Zagg doesn't make their goodness for this phone (yet?).Receipt took a full 7 days from Supershieldz, which is not unreasonable, but I've been spoiled by Amazon Prime and didn't want to use my new phone much until I had some screen protection (and kept the factory printed film on until I got these).",3.0,"Borderline fit, odd matte finish, scratched after only a week.",1383868800,"11 8, 2013",Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,"{'CS': 0.826764868, 'MNR': 0.0, 'RB': 0.0, 'RC': 36.0, 'PR': 66.66666667, 'NR': 11.11111111, 'FR': 0.083333333, 'RSP': 0.0, 'AW': 4215.0, 'RD': 1.076923077, 'RL': 2591.0, 'ER': 0.0, 'PC': 1.151631478}",0.0

These knives are not stainless steel as advertised. The knives have been treated with care and used as per manufacturers instructions (not put in the dishwasher). Not what you expect from this type of product. I bought the knife End Sept and they started staining within 6 weeks of use.Update : I called the manufacturer at Shun. These blades have a high carbon content, any residual moisture (from cleaning or food) left on the blade they will result in them rusting and staining. The knives need to be completely dried after use. The manufacturers warranty does not extend to rust and staining. As such the stainless steel is not stainless. When asked if this was a common problem they didn't deny it. They have advised me to send the knives back for inspection but do not guarantee a repair on the staining. Shipping would be at my cost but Shun will return at their own cost.From the Shun website FAQs:SHUN KNIVES ARE STAINLESS STEEL, SO WHY IS THERE RUST ON MY BLADE? IS RUST COVERED UNDER WARRANTY?Stainless steel knives can still develop rust. Rust is caused by moisture left on the blade. Rust is not a manufacturing defect and is not covered under warranty. To remove rust from steel, we recommend a product named Flitz. Flitz is a blue gel which helps remove rust, stains, and corrosion from steel. If you decide to use the product, use it only on the areas directly affected by rust. We recommend not letting the Flitz sit on the blade steel for any length of time. After applying the Flitz and removing the rust, please wash your knife thoroughly with warm, soapy water, completely dry it with an absorbent material cloth or towel, and finish with a light coating of cooking-grade oil on the blade and handle cap of the knife. Specific instructions on how to use the Flitz product are available on the Flitz container. Our instructions are not intended to either supplement or surplant the directions of the Flitz manufacturer.I have owned Zwilling and Global knives for over 15 years and never had a problem with them (similar to the above).Best avoid these knives unless you can show them the necessary care and attention.

The only thing that bugs me a little bit is that the European and Asian versions of both of these watches come with a sapphire crystal and we here in North America get stuck with a cheaper mineral one.  Granted you can send it in to Citizen (google it or call them, it's somewhere in California.) and have them replace it with Sapphire for $90 or so, but a $400 plus dive watch should definitely come with sapphire, especially when we know other parts of the world gets it for the same relative price. Maybe we don't demand it or whatever. Other than those opinions, it's a fantastic watch. Face looks gorgeous when the light hits it.

Starting off, I been sifting through the many brands and kinds of kits with clips, cases and rings and any-mini-my-ne-mo'd this one. Now, I purchased this product from 3 different shippers. Planned one being a primary use, second as a back up and a third for a gift.One was from shipped from China (if time is a factor I'd suggest paying more for a local standard shipper). The other two were from the United States, one was standard mail and one was shipped quickly. It took 2 and a half weeks for the china to show, average time from its location. I've received items under a 2 week period from china with standard shipping before, but don't expect that miracle every time.  It takes a while for customs to clear packages through there ICS stations. So be patient.Standard USA shipper was only a day behind the quickly shipped package. I'd suggest Standard to save a few bucks, always enjoy a good deal for the right price. Why pay $5 more for something that you can get for $5 less tomorrow?UNPACKING. They all arrived in different packages(envelopes), each order arriving in two separate packages. For the 3 purchases, I received six packages. The Fish Eye lens always arrived by itself in its various shipping envelope package, inside having its own tiny zip lock plastic disposable package complete with the fish eye lens, a keychain and a couple 3M rings. The Wide Angle Lens + Macro arrived in its own shipped package complete with its tiny zip lock plastic disposable package containing the single set lens which is the Wide Angle Lens + Macro, a keychain and a couple 3M rings. The Macro lens is screwed into the Wide Angle Lens so you will need to separate the Wide Angle off the Macro to use just the Macro lens. Pretty standard shipping contents.INSTALLING. They installed pretty easy to the iPhone I own. Sadly I don't use my phone without it's case so you will need to remove the case. I had a smaller case laying around, much thinner than the one I currently used and tried attaching it. It worked, just. The more distance between the devices camera and the lens itself creates a narrower field scope with [any] attachable lens.Your eye sees roughly 170 degree, looking through a ring that is pressed against your face everything seen through that ring will be roughly your actual vision. Moving the same ring an inch from your face will lessen what you see inside that ring. Moving it further away reduces overall internal scope. Same effect applies with these attachable lens. In short, having the lens attached to your case, your increasing the distance lens from lens effecting the overall scope.I would suggesting using no case, or if you have the need for these...getting the back protectors that covers the back of your iPhone much like how screen protectors do.PERFORMANCE.  THE FISH EYE performed as expected. It's lens limitations visible on the edges in photo mode but not when dealing in video mode. The degree I'd guess is around 170 degrees and 155 degrees. Never actually tested this but it is sizably impressive for its lightweight compact design. I've seen the 220-degree fish eye lens for Nikon, that weighs over 11 lbs.  Google the 220 degree lens, and you might be impressed with the design of this fish eye lens.THE WIDE ANGLE is an underrated design of the fish eye. It requires the Macro attachment to operate properly, so you can't separate the two ie gift the Wide Angle to a friend and the Macro to another friend. Only the Macro operates by itself, the Wide Angle requires the Macro to function. The angle which the Fish Eye scopes, the Wide Angle does just slightly less then that. The Wide Angle is for having more in view, limiting the spherical distortion of the Fish Eye. Impressive is you don't want the Fish Eye distortion, but personally I prefer the Fish Eye because you get a little bit more field of vision than the Wide Angle. Using the Wide Angle vs the Fish Eye during fast moving(running) you will get a bit more shock/vibration shakiness. I wouldn't suggest the Wide Angle when doing high shock movements.THE MACRO is truly remarkable for it's size. Not as amazing actual high end cameras, but still remarkable. This is my first test of the MACRO lens overall, having dealt with various of FILM cameras in my time I never had a MACRO lens attachment of any of my previous cameras. This Macro will make everything blurry as does all macro lens attachments. This is supposed to happen. But get in close to your object, within inches and the details will burst out in a crazy sense of amazement. I captured my girlfriends eye pupil to where the lens was actually making contact with her eye lashes. The detail the eye has you never see with your naked eye, is kinda creepy. I used to thing she had very pretty eyes. Now, they look....well the Macro worked perfectly. Maybe to perfect lol.THE 3M RINGS: The stupid little 3M rings you place on your phone are a joke. I personally loved the lens, but the rings never actually STICK to the phone for a carefree installation. I've cleaned the surfaces, alcohol swabbed and still the adhesive comes off. At times the 3M ring fell off when the lens was on my iPhone taking the whole lens with it to the floor. I'd suggest if this happens to you, apply E6000 Glue via toothpick, just a dab. Allow the ring to set for a couple hours. Then from there you can leave the ring on without an issue. If you want to remove it, pry it off safely. The residue clears right up with nail polish remover and you never even noticed you had a ring on there.OVERALL: I am happy with the purchase. I waited what seems like forever for the china package. Once I got that I ordered two more sets. Absolutely a must have for any budgeted photograph enthusiast with an iPhone. There are more advanced types of lens sets but this one is truly amazing with its impressively low cost design. Apart for the 3M rings, I still give this 5 stars. (Rating 4.6)Doesn't work with iPod's (without considerable customization) due to their camera closer to the edge and tapering into a curve which doesn't allow the stupid 3M ring to stick.",4.0,"iRave Review, sorta...",1393027200,"02 22, 2014",Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,"{'CS': 0.73527249, 'MNR': 0.666666667, 'RB': 2.0, 'RC': 6.0, 'PR': 66.66666667, 'NR': 33.33333333, 'FR': 0.333333333, 'RSP': 0.0, 'AW': 151.0, 'RD': 0.827586207, 'RL': 6214.0, 'ER': 0.0, 'PC': 3.719172633}",0.0

Actually, I was mainly drawn to this product because of the included Rocket Blower. The one included in the package (the smallest one Giottos offers) usually costs around $13 by itself BEFORE shipping. I believe Adorama and B&H; do not offer free shipping for the blower alone. So, for me, this is a Rocket Blower and extras package for a price only $2-3 more than the blower itself WITHOUT shipping costs. A very good value, in my opinion.On to the products, the Rocket Blower is the one I've used most. It is the smallest one offered by Giottos, the other two being 1 and 2 inches longer, I believe. The advantage of the larger Rocket Blowers is that they have an elongated shape, which allows them to fit in the palm entirely so that you can get a really good squeeze on them. The small one included in this package is more ball shaped, and with my larger hands, it feels very small in comparison. Sounds bad, but being so small is it advantage. I keep my camera gear in a Lowepro Slingshot A200, and this little guy fits in the upper storage area very well and doesn't take up too much room. I borrowed a friend's 6.5 inch Rocket Blower, and while it isn't much longer, that little bit of extra room it takes up is enough for me to appreciate the small one in this kit. Aside from the convenient shape, it works as advertised. The little inlet valve on the bottom really does prevent the blower from taking in dust, which is a huge enemy of camera bodies.The included microfiber cloth works well for removing smudges on filters or a lens' front element. The cleaning solution and swabs work very well on front elements and viewfinders. There are 10 swabs included in the kit. They each have a pointed end on one side (works great in tighter spots), and a round end on the other like a regular q-tip. The cleaning solution comes in a small 30mL spray bottle. The last accessory is a small retractable brush that, according to the brush, uses goat hair. I don't know if that's supposed to make it any better, but it works well enough for me.While I do love this kit, I've read a few reviews about some problems that may arise. I think it's fair to go over the ones I've read about most. Some have said the hairs on the retractable brush fall off easily. Also, some say that dust and dirt can easily enter the brush and get trapped in the hairs since it does not have a cap. About the cleaning cloth, I've also read that it can absorb dirt very easily. My solution for those problems: zip-lock bags. Keeping the cloth and brush in zip-lock bags should help prevent any stray dust/dirt, and that will help you from transferring them onto your costly camera gear.So, do I like this product? Yes.

That sometimes happens which is why buying things online unassembled can be risky.  We used their web site to order the missing parts using the model number listed on the assembly instructions and I followed up with a call the following day.  I was told they would get the missing product in the mail that day and I would receive it within a couple of days.  When the product did not arrive as promised, I called them back only to find out the product had never been shipped because of some confusion in the warehouse about what I wanted (huh?).  When that got squared away, they did ship us the missing parts but the problem was that the model number listed on the assembly instructions was for the same product in a different color so naturally, they shipped the right parts but in the wrong color (oops!)!  They then agreed to ship the correct color but at my insistence, they send it overnight instead of their usual 2-day delivery.  After all, this was their mistake, right?  Well, when I got the FedEx tracking number, it turned out they sent it by 3-day delivery instead of overnight (oops again!).  Finally, I got the department manager on the phone, gave him an earful, and got him to ship the product by FedEx next day delivery with the caveat that if it was not on my doorstep by 10am the following day, he should go into witness protection &lt;grin>.  The correct parts arrived at 0745 the following day as promised, nearly 30 days after the product was first ordered from Amazon.com and two weeks after the product was opened by the person assembling it!!!When we finally got it assembled, it turned out to be a well-constructed product that shows well.  However, Walker Edison's lack of quality control on so many levels should scare anyone off from purchasing their products unassembled from an online retailer.

I'm a mechanical engineer and work with smallish medical products for a living, so the idea of this knife truly intrigued me.  My thinking was to replaced the included flat screw bits with a T8 and maybe a P0 or P00, and never need to carry my Wiha tech drivers around to tear stuff down.  However, once I started actually carrying the knife, I soon found the shortcomings of the design.  Here are both the positives and negatives, in no particular order of importance:(1) The knife blade itself is only so-so.  I'm a fan of Kershaw's Speedsafe blades, and the fact this isn't one does make me not like it as much.  It's also a Chinese blade, and while I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing, it doesn't have the same feel and finish as my other US-made Kershaw blades.  Maybe it's the finish, or perhaps the steel itself--hard to tell.(2) The pocket/belt clip can't be switched to the other end, but only to the other side.  When clipped in my pocket, I carry all of my other knives with the hinge pointed down and the blade tight against the &#34;back&#34; of my pocket.  This is to protect against any unintentional openings, especially with the Speedsafe blades--if the knife were to open, it would be away from any critical body parts near my pocket or my hand as I reached in.  The multi-tool design of this knife doesn't allow for such a configuration, so one can imagine my disdain--this also changes how I'm used to pulling out the knife to open it.(3) The outside of the bit holders have very sharp corners.  These corners dig very uncomfortably into my hip/thigh whenever I wear a seatbelt.  The holders are molded out of what appears to be a thermoplastic (I'm guessing a polyamide like Nylon 12), and the mold design is responsible for the sharp corners--the parting line is at the end of the holder where the bit gets stored, and instead the mold should have been split slightly higher on the tool to add a small radius to this edge.  Maybe I'll take a file  to them to knock off the corners, but I shouldn't have to.(4) The usefulness of the driver is fairly good, actually.  The cleverness of the built-in bit holders and driver are fairly well carried out in the design.  You can't apply too much torque to the driver, though, so get out a real screwdriver for big jobs.  There are even metric and inch scales marked on the beam of the driver that are relatively useful.(5) The overall bulk of the knife isn't as bad as I thought it would be.  Aside from the thigh-killing bit holders, the knife sits well enough in a pocket.(6) It's got a built-in bottle opener!",3.0,Clever Design with Issues,1360713600,"02 13, 2013",Sports_and_Outdoors,"{'CS': 0.726873787, 'MNR': 0.333333333, 'RB': 1.0, 'RC': 6.0, 'PR': 100.0, 'NR': 0.0, 'FR': 0.0, 'RSP': 0.0, 'AW': 766.0, 'RD': 1.617801047, 'RL': 2667.0, 'ER': 0.0, 'PC': 1.256398325}",0.0

Far too much inconvenience having to undo straps to get to pockets, etc., to be really ergonomic.The materials/construction issues have already hit BOTH packs- and I haven't even gone on the hike yet!!!The 5200, the hem ripped off the water-bottle pocket when I was holding it to push the bottle down further.  The stitching was just too close to the edge of the material, and the border just tore right off.  The 4000, one of the buckles just shattered when I was tightening a strap over the rolled-up sleeping pad.  Clearly not nylon, some kind of more fragile plastic.So, I guess you get what you pay for... maybe these are still a good choice if you just can't afford the higher-end brands... a shame, as some skimping on ergonomic thought, careful construction, and good materials could I think have made these good packs.  But I'll probably end up with these both just being 'take a loss' territory.

When the hair attachments are moving and rotating in circles I'm scared that my daughter's hair will get caught and get wound up. When the hair pieces are not in the holes on her head the inside of the holes still continue to rotate during the music, I'm worried about little fingers getting stuck and twisted. I'm sure it will be recalled soon enough.My 8 year old was handing the doll to my 4 year old and she accidentally hit her in the lip. The doll is very awkward to hold and top heavy. I would definitely not recommend this toWhen you do finally secure it to the stand it does sing, dance and talk. The doll would have to be lighter and softer for me to change my mind.

One cannot deal out the cards and follow the step-by-step instruction (there is no step-by-step instruction) and begin playing (thereby figuring out more of the game). One can't find a straight answer for simple questions such as: how many cards does one draw? How many does one maintain in one's hand? When does one replenish one's hand? (The ""deal 12 cards"" instruction gets contradicted in other parts of the instruction.) To complete a ""quest"", which is the key to the game, one must go through ""stages."" But what does each stage constitute? How many cards can one lay down for each stage? I finally gave up.If one can figure out how to play the game, one may indeed learn a few things about King Arthur and his knights (their names, for example).If one wants to make up new rules and fill in the missing pieces in the instructions, this game may even be fun.But, why not read a good book on King Arthur and find a fun and stimulating game (such as Settlers of Catan or Abalone) to pass the time when one is not reading?",1.0,A contrived and convoluted game,1062979200,"09 8, 2003",Toys_and_Games,"{'CS': 0.678430887, 'MNR': 0.0, 'RB': 0.0, 'RC': 40.0, 'PR': 80.0, 'NR': 17.5, 'FR': 0.1, 'RSP': 0.0, 'AW': 4387.0, 'RD': 3.571428571, 'RL': 1427.0, 'ER': 1.0, 'PC': 1.380500431}",0.0

We rent and this house has carpet in every room, including the dining room and kitchen.  Until I got my Swivel Sweeper, I had to lug my vacuum out every day, sometimes multiple times each day.  Otherwise, food and craft items would get ground into the carpet and I'd have to shampoo it frequently.  It was a real pain.My mom gave me the Swivel Sweeper nearly two months ago after she got the buy-one-get-one deal from the infomercial.  I have to tell you that I am in love with this thing.  When she first gave it to me I thanked her but truly expected it to be a piece of junk that wouldn't pick anything up.  Boy, was I ever wrong!  Cereal, raisins, bits of construction paper, wiggly eyes; it picks it all up beautifully and no longer do I have to lug out my vacuum every day.It's for quick clean-ups and I have not had any problem with the battery running out quickly.  I usually get multiple trips through the dining room and kitchen before having to charge the battery.  The catch tray pops out for easy dumping and easy checking for things you don't want to throw away (like the wiggle eyes and my daughter's tiny Pony World pieces).  I like that it comes with a tool to rip hair and string off the rollbars with.  Every vacuum should come with such a tool.  It's really just a seam ripper; you can get one at any sewing store, but it is convenient that it actually comes with one and, quite frankly, I hadn't thought about using one for this purpose previously.I find the Swivel Sweeper to be sturdy and reliable.  My kids love to use it when they clean their rooms, as well, and they aren't exactly kind to it.  They bump it into beds and walls and it's still working fine and still unbroken.

We have four cats and it does a great job picking up the cat hair.  It's very quiet and powerful.  Like our previous Eureka, the ""Power Paw"" is next to useless on carpets (try the Eureka Easy Clean instead), but might be good on upholstery or bare floors.Our main gripes are the dust canister and the ""retracting cord.""  The dust canister empties from the bottom, which is great when it actually contains dust.  Unfortunately, this vacuum is marketed for for pets.  As I said, it picks up pet hair like crazy, but it doesn't come out!  We have to reach in and pull a wad of cat hair our every time we empty the dust canister.The cord retractor is weak.  It decelerates as the plug approaches the vacuum, presumably to avoid damage.  Unfortunately, this means the cord must be laid out perfectly straight and perpendicular to the opening for it to work properly.  That may not sound bad, but that cord is long!Bottom line: performance is great, probably worth the annoyance of manually de-furring the dust can.  Definitely save a couple bucks and avoid the cord retractor and power paw if that's an option.UPDATE, February 2014So . . . we had a pretty serious and annoying breakdown with the vacuum. My husband left a t-shirt on the floor and then sucked it up with the vacuum (insert stereotype joke here), which broke it.  We didn't expect the vacuum to survive the experience unscathed; but the WAY the vacuum broke resulted in dropping this rating to 1 star.The carpet brush on this vacuum is driven directly from the main motor by two belts, instead of having its own motor.  One of the belts is cogged and not easily replaceable.  The second is smooth and clearly designed to be easily replaced.  The ""on/off"" lever for the brush increases or decreases tension on the smooth belt to engage the brush.  The Eureka engineers clearly spent a lot of time designing this mechanism so that this belt, and ONLY this belt, is easy to replace.  It's also the only belt-maintenance listed in the manual.Logically, after so much effort, the engineers would have made sure that THIS belt would fail if anything (like a careless husband's t-shirt) got jammed in the brush.  Unfortunately for us, that's not the case.  Instead of the belt failing, a plastic sprocket that connects the two belts stripped on its inner diameter, causing the sprocket to spin uselessly and generate a nasty burning plastic smell.After disassembling nearly the entire vacuum, my husband was able to locate this sprocket and order the replacement parts - for nearly $40!  The belt is less than $10.  We paid about $160 dollars for the vacuum, and this simple (and probably very common) repair cost a quarter as much as the vacuum to repair, despite the misplaced efforts of the Eureka engineers.  I hate to think what it would have cost in a repair shop.The Eureka engineers need to return to the drawing board (or CAD station), but this time with their customers' interests in mind.",1.0,UPDATE: Great Performance - Questionable Ergonomics - Terrible Mechanics,1376092800,"08 10, 2013",Home_and_Kitchen,"{'CS': 0.682224555, 'MNR': 1.0, 'RB': 3.0, 'RC': 3.0, 'PR': 100.0, 'NR': 0.0, 'FR': 0.0, 'RSP': 0.0, 'AW': 0.0, 'RD': 2.533333333, 'RL': 3020.0, 'ER': 1.0, 'PC': 1.309328969}",0.0

(i feared to break the iphone's screen when trying to). and finally, where to put the foil, when it's not needed? the case doesn't have any space for this, and it shouldn't be scratched, either.next disappointment: there's no software included in the package for the iphone. this has to be purchased from apple's app store separately. doesn't cost that much, but still adds - both to costs and negative impressions.once the software is downloaded and the foil is attached, you find that you can't use the touch screen of the iphone where the foil goes, as it's quite thick and inflexible. this may be, why the foil only covers approx 4/5 of the screen and leaves some space below to access controls (unfortuantely it isn't bigger like that, so you couldn't even cover the whole screen, if you were e.g. watching a 3d movie or slideshow which you don't have to interfere with all the time ...)well, and finally the quality of the whole thing isn't that great. due to the already limited resolution of the iphone's screen, sharing it for two separate images for the left and the right eye requires quite a rough lenticular foil with clearly visible diagonal ripples ...still: yes, it's 3d!nevertheless: pretty much money for a small piece of plastic ...

The input connector of the headphones seems to be the weakest hardware aspect as I found them to be scratchy if the body behind the jack is bent in anyway.Sound levels of the headphones feel muted and dull. I tried changing EQ on my iPod to various levels and I never felt the quality matched the AudioTechnica's.

Personally, I'm especially happy that the Soyuz and Progress spacecraft can separate from the station, but beware that the Soyuz is actually used to help hold the main junction together.For the price though, the model isn't terrible if you're willing to do a little extra work gluing it.

It requires a lot of adult supervision and you have to run water through the doll via the bottle a lot to wash it out. Also you would have to continue to purchase additional food packets and diapers for the doll, which honestly, who wants the additional cost of doing that?

Secondly, emptying the canister should be a hands free endeavor, but every time I empty it, I end up having to stick my hand up to the top of the canister to reach the stuff that's gotten stuck up there.  I don't enjoy that.  Thirdly, it's HEAVY!  Lastly, while the suction is good, it's not the powerhouse that the ads lead you to believe.

I have used the Command Mini Hooks before and ran out while hanging my Christmas lights outside my house, so that's why I went to Amazon to buy some more.  But it was my mistake... I ended up buying the Decorating Clips, which is *NOT* the same thing.  I didn't have the original packaging, so there was no way for me to know for sure what I was buying until it was too late.I love Command products, but this one only deserves 4 stars vs 5 that I've given other Command products.  The reason being is that as decorating clips, they are roughly half to a 3rd the size of the Mini Hooks I referenced in the previous paragraph.  With that much reduction in size, the SURFACE AREA for the adhesive to adhere to the hook itself and the wall is that much smaller.  Smaller surface area for adhesion MEANS LESS STRENGTH for it to stay on the wall.  So because of this, it SEVERELY limits what you are able to hang on these.As I said earlier and like many other people, I mainly use Command hooks for Christmas decorations.  If you're trying to hang Christmas lights, I **HIGHLY** recommend you get a stronger hook, such as theCommand Mini Hooks, Clear, 18-Hook.  Those are rated for 1/2 pound PER hook.  I'm using about of dozen of these, OUTSIDE my house in the sub 30 degree F weather, on my windows, and they are strong enough to hang my Christmas lights on.  The Decorating Clips however, DO NOT HAVE A WEIGHT RATING!!  So as I have said before, these won't do you any good if you're trying to hang any kind of item (aka Christmas lights) with weight.What I have found use for these, is to hang very light items.  Things like balloons, paper lanterns, ornaments, banners, etc.... These are the items you want to hang using the Decorating Clips.Although I am severely limited in what I can use with these Decorating Clips, they still have a purpose, as I've used a handful of them for hanging ornaments on my wall.

It came with this cover for your phone.3). Came with 2 batteries.4). Came with a screen protectant.5). I like the messaging conversation look. It's not bubbles like with an iPhone or with the Samsung Galaxy Note 2.6). You can throw this phone on the ground as hard as you can because of how bad it will irritate you and it won't crack. It's plastic!MY HATES:1). My AT&T; sims card was too small so I went to Radio Shack and spent $25 on a bigger sims card & then I went to AT&T; and got it activated. It now works so it's alright now. But that was pretty irritable.2). I don't know if in the description the seller said it was pink. Maybe I didn't read it. I don't like the color pink. I thought it was white so that upset me. What if I was a boy? I would have returned it.3). The ear phones look and feel cheap.4). I bought this yesterday and this already is freezing up on me when I try to text. It hasn't been even 24 hours since I'v actually started using it.5). When I'm texting someone and I want to erase the whole text message that I was about to send I would hold the backspace button down to erase faster and then the keyboard just goes away and I have to swipe up to get the keypad back up. So you have to individually, for each letter backspace.6). When I'm in a phone call I can't use my phone at all. My phone goes black and I can't do anything until the person on the other end ends the call. I can't end my calls. The other person has to hang up because I can't. So I can be in a phone call with my mother and then I can't hang up. What if my boyfriend says something inappropriate before I got to hang up?7). It feels cheap in your hands.You don't need a case for it. It's plastic. I've actually thrown this phone on the ground twice as soon as I started using it because of how bad this phone is. It doesn't even deserve half of a star rating.8). When I'm texting someone I have to be careful because I'll be texting and then all of a sudden the keypad goes away and its hard to swipe the keypad back up.9). The phone has 2 sim card places so if you only have one sim card in the phone it will keep on asking you if the 2nd sims card is ready to use in the notification area.The only reason I'm keeping this phone is because I've had my wait to get this phone.

The unique game play of overlaying a transparent card with open-line symbols and solid symbols from another card to make a Swish continues in Junior. New leaf and double arrow shapes have been added to the visuals in Junior. Rather than a 4x4 card playing field, Junior uses a 3x4 playing area. Requirement to use 2, 3, or 4 cards to make a Swish through flip, rotate, or stack action is set at the beginning of a game.  To me the name Junior implies that this version would be easier than the Original. We failed to find that true in our games. Though the game is age graded 5 to adult, our game players were all older adult groups.

We chose the Smart Gear over the other copies (and the original) because of its low price, not wanting to pay $200-$300 for a wooden push bike.  Well, you get what you pay for.Immediately after purchasing it, I had to replace both tubes.  Whoever assembled the wheels at the factory must have used a tool that ended up slicing both tubes.  Then, within a few weeks with barely any use, all the plywood started to delaminate--first the wheels, then the main frame, then the seat column.  If you look carefully at the plywood, you can see that the inner layers of wood are extremely low-grade.Once my son grew enough to actually use the balance bike, the axle bolts kept unwinding themselves out of their mating/binding posts.  I had to apply nail polish on the threads to stop the unwinding--an old trick I use when wrenching my own stable of 13 bicycles.  By the way, the rear axle bolt and its binding post go through the frame's wood at a right angle, but due to the curves of the main frame components, the wood pieces are not parallel; therefore, the rear axle stays constantly bent, putting pressure on the wheel bearings.Despite the use of sub-par materials and poorly-executed construction, the Smart Gear balance bike is one of my son's favorite toys.  He's now quite adept at cruising on the bike, pushing with his feet then bringing them up and steering to stay upright.I should also mention that unlike many of its competitors, the Smart Gear has a built-in handle.

A few little pieces have also started to come loose on the edges.  I give it about another month or two and it should be toast!My Otterbox Defender lasted exactly one year.  After several drops, the plastic inside the silicone case started to crack, causing the overall structure to give.... This Ballistic case is a replacement for the Otterbox.  It came in a plain plastic bag with a barcode and no instructions.  When all put together it feels heavier than the Otterbox and slightly bulkier because of the raised silicone grips.  My first complaint is how easy the outer silicone case comes off.  I don't think it will take long for it to get looser to where I will be constantly pulling and stretching the skin back over the plastic case.  It covers the entire back, but then only comes around the front four corners. I don't know about simply using the inner plastic case without the silicone because like other cases it will most likely pop open if dropped. I do like how the port covers stick into the ports and the external speakers sound better than the otterbox.  I never used the otterbox belt clip because it always felt like a good bump would send it flying off the holder.  This case clips in and locks really good.  Both cases are made in CHINA, so we will see how it does long term.***UPDATE**** I can't really use that outer silicone case because it is way too big.  Hard to get into a pocket (sticky/bulky) and I cannot use another enclosed belt clip case I had for my otterbox or use the same vehicle mount phone holder I was using.  So far just the inner case is working fine.  I haven't dropped it yet, so yet to see if the phone will stay in it, or split apart and fall out like other snap cases.  It is tough to find a 3.5MM jack that will fit in the phone now because the inner case has a small opening around it.  You will have to get one with a slim plug base.  As one reviewer described, the far left and right screen functions occasional get funky as the case pops out a bit at the edges. You find yourself really trying to get your finger tip in there just right to activate whatever is on the screen.

There are 3 possible improvements it could have had that would have made me absolutely love this knife.1. The pocket clip: Its too tight and is too low on the knife causing about an inch of the knife to be sticking out of your pocket.2. The knife could use a spring assisted action, it has none, just a plain standard open knife.3. It has the G-10 handle material only on one side, the otherside is the liner lock and is just painted grey. If they took the G-10 and cut it a little thinner and put it on both sides it'd be much more desireable.Overall, this Boker knife is pretty cool. I do like the blade design and milled holes in the blade are cool looking. For 25$ you def get a nice knife thats worth the money. It is less likely to break on you like other knives due to its simplicity. I'd buy again if i wasnt so into OTF and spring assisted knives.

(However I immediately received an email trying to soliciting a five start review from me from either the seller or the manufacturer so I think maybe it won't be so hyped if they don't use those ""tricks"").Like the title says, the quality is so so, when compared to either the incase revolution folio which I got for close to $80 from BB or the bear motion folio I got from right here which cost like 2 bucks more.Even the packaging tells this, Bear motion one is packed in a reusable zippered zip-loc type bag while this one is in a flimsy single use plastic bag with some glue to hold it in place and some paper with an awful Advertisement on it(it's hard to tell why would they pay to print an Advertisement to sell you something that you have already bought) which basically reads ""you wear clothes, so your device needs to wear devicewear product"", I for one don't really see why that is the case.Then to the case itself, well it seems to be a fine leather case, however it's really PITA to get your ipad into it. Getting out is literally like pulling your ipad apart. I understand pulling ipad out of a folio is not something you do everyday but that doesn't mean it should be so hard. Not to mention if any dust get in (which is very likely considering there's no outer shell and there are multiple exposed areas) and trapped between your ipad and the case. Then pulling it out will certainly result in a deep and long scratch because they are held so closely together.The Velcro strip used to hold the ipad in place is also very flimsy, I don't know how much they could bring the cost down on something as simple as that but they unfortunately chose to be cheap on that. It basically can't hold itself in place, let alone the Ipad. (However the ipad won't necessarily fall out, because of the above mentioned ""hard to get out"". Maybe that's by design? Then they shouldn't have used the velcro strip at all right?)Lack of a outer protecting bag and obvious logo on folio might not be a problem for some (or even for me) but it would be nice to see those, cause the competitor did those right.The bear motion one is also much better made if you place both before you and have a close look.All in all, Isuggest anyone who is interested in an affordable leather folio for their Ipad 3 get the bear motion one instead of this one.

So I just wanted to relay my experience.I bought this for my 5 year old starting tee ball. This helmet is too tight. So I physically went to a local sporting goods store to try the Easton Two-Tone SENIOR. Well that helmet is too big. So I settled for an Under Armour helmet which fits perfect. (both helmets were $29.99 as well)I was a little disappointed as my sons gear is all Easton. Bat. Bag. etc etc. So I really wanted the Easton Two-Tone helmet to work out. Just wasn't the case.One final point. And this is just my own opinion. After looking at the head measurements for the two helmets. The Easton Junior Two-Tone's sizing is 6 3/8  - 7 1/8. Then the Under Armour states its sizing is 5 7/8 - 6 3/4.  Based on this information you would think if the Easton was too tight so would the Under Armour. Couldn't be further from the truth. The Under Armour fit perfectly.Its not like you can wear in or stretch a helmet. Its a hard plastic. It fits how it fits.My opinion is that the reason for this is that the Under Armour helmet has very soft padding inside resulting in more give for the head (and also resulting in a more comfortable fit). Whereas the Easton (and plenty other brands) have a more hard foam inside. And trust me I remember from my little league days how uncomfortable those helmets were.Also, upon further research each helmet meets the same standards so I don't think this difference would result in any loss in quality or protection.My 3 stars is not a result of the Easton helmet being of poor quality. It is a fine helmet. It feels of good quality. I liked the two-tone aspect. It looked really sharp. (I had ordered the black/silver). The helmet just didn't fit.Maybe Easton should make more varied helmet sizes. I mean just JR and SR? Two sizes? They lost my business based on a lack of sizing.One final thought.

First off I bought it on cyber Monday so it was only $59.99. Not a badprice and I know my bf had been wanting a tough truck to drive around our acre of land out in the country. Sadly he unwrapped it and opened it and it worked for all of 3 mins before we tried to raise it up like a monster trruck and it locked up. couldn't get it to go back down or move and after that incident havent messed with it since. It was supposed to just be a fun kinda toy that required no effort, granted we are big car ppl and we are in our mid 20s its nice to escape sometimes. Another big issue is that in order to put batteries in you gotta whip out a screw driver and take the cab off to get the battery in and out!! Now back when I was younger you could switch a battery using a dime or penny and it would take 1 minute tops but this thing take 5-10mins for a battery change. I like the idea of the vehicle but for $60 no thanks and now it does nothing so Im returning it for a refund.

I wrote out a page of cursive, block text & doodles and while there indeed were a few skips here and there, everything was still very legible.  Granted, I think there is room for improvement in the ""ink"" delivery system, but this writing instrument has great potential if those improvements can be made by Sharpie.As for erasing, this pencil sports a standard-type eraser.  I have used erasable-ink pens before that have ink that is heat sensitive; i.e., the ""eraser"" is just a hard rubber knob that, when rubbed on the ink, heats it up causing it to literally disappear.  That is not the case here.  Not only was I able to easily erase the markings from this pencil with the supplied eraser, but also one of those ""add-on"" erasers that slip onto the end of an old-fashioned wooden pencil.  Also, a standard gum eraser.  All erased this pencil's markings completely & easily soon (within a minute or two) after writing.  And, erasing was nearly equally as complete & easy about 1 hour later.  However, 4 or 5 hours later, the ""ink"" would no longer easily & completely erase, as noted here by other reviewers.All in all, as a ""heavy-handed"" writer who often breaks lead in a standard mechanical pencil, I found this ""liquid mechanical pencil""  to be a cool concept with a lot of potential.

You cannot get it into or out of the oven without using a cookie sheet to support it. My other silicone muffin pan from another manufacturer is thicker and sturdier, and i can hold it flat with two hands even when it's loaded up with batter.Aside from that, it has all the usual benefits of silicone. It's pretty non-stick, you can press muffins out from below (once they've cooled) instead of trying to stick a knife or fork alone the side to pop them out, and you can throw it in the dishwasher when you're done.I probably won't use this for baking. The slide-off-the-cookie-sheet maneuver can be fraught with peril. However, it'll do just fine for freezing. As an avid gardener, i end up with vastly more zucchini than i can use during the summer, so i shred it and freeze it so i can make zucchini muffins without paying too much for pallid, off-season zucchini at the market in January. Silicone muffin tins are perfect for this, since you can just flip them over and press the rounds out instead of letting them half-thaw so you can pry them out of a metal tin.

The available adjustments make for great enhancements and tweaks for any kind of display (plasma, lcd, led, projector (dlp or lcd or ...).  The streaming options are fantastic with Amazon Video, Netflix, YouTube, and a host of other streaming services (including music/radio streaming services).  The Sony Entertainment Network is also available and that adds a host of additional options for viewing/listening (however, I'm not a fan so I've not explored it too much).  Netflix on this unit (at least after performing latest firmware upgrade ... more on that in the 'ugly' section of this review) give you truer HD performance with 1080p streaming and DD+ 5.1 surround capabilities.  Watching Killer Elite on video was actually fantastic.For what gets a 1 or 2 star rating:  The 'bad'I've updated to the latest firmware and when I put in a disc and then turn on my whole entertainment setup, the blu-ray players either turns off (which is ok) or worse freezes at the menu for some reason.  When it appears to not freeze and simply hit play to start the blu-ray disc, the machine freezes and will not shut off and the soft-buttons keep flashing ... I have to unplug it to reset the unit.  I may have a bad unit and I will probably replace it, but this should never happen.  I've had so many dvd and blu-ray players and this is the worst behaving one I've ever had.  I've had the unit less than 24 hours and had to unplug it 3 times .... ouch.  As bad as this is, the worst is yet to come.The 'ugly'When attempting to setup the networking setting out of the box ... the unit would not connect when everthing else in my house was connecting fine.  The wired connection would not work.  So I tried wireless ... this is where the extreme ugly comes in to play.  I used the automatic WPS networking setting where you go and  push a button on your router and it auto-negotiates with the device and setup the blu-ray player's network settings.  Well, instead of setting the player, the player when working with my router UNBELIEVABLY changed my routers SSID to gibberish and also change my passphrase to gibberish ... and then nothing in my house, including the Sony blu-ray player would connect to my home network ... UGGH.... so not being a techno-phobe noobie, I logged into my router withl admin rights and changed my SSID and settings back, but my router decided that I could not apparently just change it all back and all would be good ... Nooo ... I had to re-choose and rekey in the passphrase on every wireless device in our house .... which we have a ton, a few in nearly every room .... arghhh.... way to go Sony.  Not only is this bad, it is ugly and down right dangerours ....Now I decided with such craziness going on that I had to update the firmware and perhaps that would take care of the wireless issue ... but because I could not get it to connect to my network nor trusted the darn thing to not screw up my network, I downloaded the firmware (396 or something...) and burned the files to CDR and then updated the players, which went ok.  However, the player after ejecting the disc and my turning it back on, it strangely rebooted itself at least 20 times which made me think that I had a complete lemon on my hands.  Eventually it stopped after about 15 minutes and now work fine except for the behavior in the 'bad' part of this review.I'd say to wait and see if Sony works out the firmware issues or quality issues or whatever the issue is with this player.

But regarding its educational value, fun factor and usability, reading the other reviews, we must be missing something:- For each position of the animals there are just two versions of a short sound the animal supposedly makes (the horse sounds more like a small rodent). That sound is the same whatever is pressing the button down - any of the figurines or little fingers. Therefore, the toy is missing out on a learning effect that some kind of negative feedback for wrong placement would have, in my opinion.- A few of the animals need to be pressed in a certain way to trigger the sound. Our daughter of 2 1/4 learned the necessary pushing quickly enough,  but I would have doubts with younger children.- Regarding the fun playing and pushing around, the joints between the three parts on our tractor were very stiff.

They are so cute, but do not look durable. Might be good for just house slippers.I normally wear a 6.5 to 7 medium-wide and I had to buy these in a size 8 for a perfect fit, with about a 1/2 inch to spare at the toes!! No kidding! I think the person sizing them in the factory must have been on crack or something, because the sizes are not even CLOSE to reality! TRUST ME!!! YOU NEED TO ORDER at least one size up!!! You will need room for your toes because the toebox squishes and points upward. The salesman at the store told me these all fit a size smaller than stated.The problem is, they are so unique, I couldn't pass them up even if they are expensive and poorly made. They feel like ballet slippers on, and there is a somewhat decent rubber sole. Very cute.You must order UP or you will totally be wasting your time and money. I am a true size 6.5 and the 8 fits perfectly. I might have gotten away with a 7.5, but I am glad I got the 8. This is the first ""size 8"" I have ever worn in my life! Trust me, it is NOT size 8, it fits like a 7.I would never wear these for all day or anything like that, maybe just for a short walk, or take them as slippers to wear in someone's house.

However, the uniqueness of this shoe is what got me drooling.UPDATE: one week later, after wearing the shoes for a week, they are a little too loose. I put an insole in them and it is better, but one foot is still too loose. My shoes are 1.5 sizes bigger and I think the one size up would have sufficed, but I do not think they come in half sizes. I prefer the insole in them anyway as there is little support to the shoe otherwise. With the shoe in my size, my toes hit the end of the shoe.

Maps are great and easy interface, although I had a garmin before. Like the auto, bike and walk features, last position, and what is near you now. Maps are great and POIs are plentiful.The Bad:Speaker sound quality in back of unit is poor, skipping/choppy Text To Speach (TTS) voice directions for all TTS voices forcing one to read the text, bluetooth works but quality is poor so is unusable to me (treo 680). Skipping TTS is a deal breaker for me and if garmin support can't fix the problem it will go back. The voice Dr. Nightmare is a free download and is great, for its loud, doesn't skip and is clear (kids love it too) but its not TTS so not good for everyday use.The Ugly:FM transmitter works but can't listen to radio station. I should be able to listen to my FM station and when the GPS needs to speak it should then cut in then cut out when complete. Who wants to listen to static the entire time, oh yea, we need to because the speaker on the unit is not very good. I guess I could hardwire it into my car stereo but that is another wire floating around my car .... why ?  I had the unit freeze up on me a few times, although to be fair I was zipping through the menus so maybe it can't handle fast menu changes.Summary:I want to keep this unit but TTS issues if not resolved will force me to return it. Garmin is easy to use and my older c320 worked flawlessly for years so I expected the same quality .....  maybe not .....I'll wait for new units to come out in 2Q if I return this one.

This was really a surprise, since this is an Android pad. However, I am ok with this. I am not going to use this for reading email or viewing calendars, though it would be real nice if this works.I installed MobileSheet which is the app of my choice to manage my music scores. The app installed smoothly and runs ok. Another problem all a sudden showed up and made me quite upset. The screen went crazy zooming in and out and moving back and forth between several screens, like it was controlled by an invisible hand or fingers. I had to shut it down and reboot the device.The &#34;crazy screen&#34; problem has been showing up randomly. Once it occurs, I have to shut it down and reboot.

Beadle ""Entrepreneur""","[3.0, 4.0]","I have a fairly moderate home theater system:  large format HDTV, DirecTV, Onkyo Amp/Video switch, Roku, Wii, and DVD.  That's four inputs and one output.  I don't consider that complex.This is my second Harmony remote.  Between them, I have had a couple of professional systems: URC and Philips, along with Roomie Remote for iPad.  All have cool features, but none have it all.  Philips was the closest to filling the bill, but Philips recently locked down their software, making my $500 Philips system a boat anchor.From there, I tried Roomie. It is actually quite nice, exploiting Net connectivity with fancy program guides.  But it doesn't have tactile feel.  I wanted nice buttons that my fingers could find in the dark.So... I went back to Harmony.  Big Mistake.  I wasn't happy with the first one.On the plus side:They have made huge improvements since my last Harmony. In the early versions, the ""Chicklet"" keys were flimsy.  I really like the look and feeling of this unit.The touch screen is a nice addition.  WIth 500 channels available, i can't watch them all. I was able to put the 25 or so that I do watch a touch buttons on the display.  This was WAY easier than with the Philips professional system.Most of the hard buttons are easy to find and work as expected.The software is easy to set up - as far as it goes.  If you follow the directions, ""Programming"" takes about 10 minutes.  On Philips, it took several hours.But....I DVR many programs.  I want a hard button to skip forward/backwards.  On my Philips, I programmed a button to Skip 6 forward - the typical time for a commercial break.  On the new Harmony, this is a touch screen button hidden below three menus.  It clearly isn't something to invoke simply with motor memory...  This is a deal-breaker for me.The User Manual is very skimpy.  It covers basic programming, but little on use.  One of the interesting feature is ""gesturing"" like on iPhone.  Cool concept, but zero instruction about what the gestures are.  It would be great if they had a ""skip commercial"" gesture, but NO.  So far, I have found this feature useless.  Edit...  After a week I did find the help screen on each command provides some of what should be in the manual.  The gestures are a little more useful than I had realized. I can swipe left to right to fast forward.  Swipe again and the pace increases.  Tap and it stops and plays.  There is more guesswork than with a skip 30 seconds button, but it does work.  I have added a star.Adding unusual devices isn't handled well, as far as I can tell.  I have Roku.  It uses WiFi for remote control.  No luck with this remote (And I knew that in advance), but I haven't found a way to customize features.  For example, in Sat mode, the CH up/down buttons go to the DirecTV box as expected.  But in Roku mode, the CH buttons change from HDMI1 input on the TV to over-the-air mode.  So if I am watching Roku and inadvertently touch Channel, i get static.  I tried going back to ""HOME"" and selecting Roku again, expecting it to select HDMI1 - NOPE.Overall - This would be a really cool remote at $79.  But at $250, not so much..  For even low-end home theater systems, this remote just doesn't have the needed flexibility.  Edit. I am still looking.",3.0,"Cool Design and Features - But not ""It"" yet",1351814400,"11 2, 2012",Electronics,"{'CS': 0.810153215, 'MNR': 1.0, 'RB': 2.0, 'RC': 32.0, 'PR': 87.5, 'NR': 6.25, 'FR': 0.09375, 'RSP': 0.0, 'AW': 4161.0, 'RD': 0.643700787, 'RL': 3246.0, 'ER': 0.0, 'PC': 3.358063257}",0.0

The black blade coating was uneven in places. Wasn't impressed with the handle wrap either.  The knife is a tough, thick piece of stainless, with good jimping and a useful lanyard hole already in place.  Lots of potential.  Time for a makeover...I got rid of the silly string handle, polished the knife down to bare metal (belt sander and wire brush, followed by hand sanding).  I then fit a hickory handle to it, added a paracord lanyard, and went to town sharpening it.  The belly of the blade seemed to shapen easily, but the straight portion required some work with a diamond stone; I think the original angle was simply too shallow for the thickness of the steel.  After all that (and it was fun), I was rewarded with a durable little hunting knife I can actually use in the field.  Next up, gonna make a real sheath for it.Recommend this as raw material for making a custom knife.

I was under the mistaken idea that a direct connection to my PC could be made and pictures transferred to it directly if it had a Wireless 802.11 N adapter which it does. However, this connection had to be configured through my home router to get to my wireless connected PC. Here's the line that led me to believe that; ""Photos and videos can automatically land in date-based folders of your choice on your computer or even directly into iPhoto for Macs."" (Yeah, if you have your PC connected to the router it can)! Then it does not support transfer of RAW format imagery and only transfers JPEG images. Even to get to that point, I had to set my camera's AUTO-ON CSM Mode to 30 minutes to allow the images to be transferred to the PC by way of the router (Nikon D80). Without that battery draining feature, the image transfer gets cut off in mid stream as the camera shuts down to save the battery power. Although it does transfer relatively quickly, it is very easy in this mode to forget you still have the power on and the batteries are being drained! My recommendation is spring for a high quality SD card and skip the transfer crap and move them onto your PC when you get the memory card plugged-in directly to it. Not enough versatility in the product for the money. Let me know when you've got the card to PC direct transfer done and then maybe I'll try them again.

Firstly, there was no foam around the face side, so my skin is touching the composite frame. Fitting, on the other hand, was quite nice. The way it forms to the face is quite comfortable with or without a helmet or other head gear....I only wish it were a little easier to smile with them on.Anyways, the second issue I ran into with buying used was that both of the lenses were better suited for simulated drunk vision than optical protection. This didn't matter too much with the smoke lens, since it's already meant to block UV rays. The real issue is fogging. Used lenses don't have the same anti-fog capabilities as brand new ones (When wearing a mask with the goggles, my breath goes right up into the frame and doesn't even leave a spot).With that said, get them brand new, and if your lenses start to go bad--which is hard to achieve--then just get a new lens. The frames look pretty durable and stand up to a lot impact and jostling. The elastic may become a problem with repeated, heavy use but thus is life.Another word of warning aside from buying them new: Follow ESS' instructions on maintenancing the lenses. I had my suspicions on the murkiness of the lenses, thinking heavy usage until I saw &#34;Don't use cleaning solvents,&#34; and my girlfriend suggested that someone might have tried to use Windex.

For the second round, I thinned the dough to more like a batter (added milk and water) then tried a turkey baster to fill the cavities but it was still too thick for the suction of the baster to work.  Ultimately I used the syringe-like medicine dispenser we get from the pharmacy when the kids get meds (it was clean of course) and that seemed to work a bit better but was still difficult to use.

First of all, the two front wheels were bent right out of the box.  I am sure this happened during shipping, but it should be able to withstand the abuse UPS puts their shipments thru.  Also the cover had holes in it from the handle rubbing (also I assume during shipping or on the boat ride over from China).Only reason I risked buying this thing online (vs in person at the fair, etc) was because of Amazon's great return policy.  I put this thing right back in the box and made had Amazon send the UPS guy back to pick it up the next day.  In short, you may luck out and get one un damaged.  I would NOT buy this for your kids to ride in (which is why I bought it).

At first I thought it would only snap onto the rigid tube to which the hose was attached and not the hose itself, which would have made it difficult to use. Then I found out I was not pushing hard enough on the groom tool to make it lock onto the hose.I have an aftermarket hose since, like on so many DC25s, the clip on the hose which secures attachments broke soon after I got the vacuum, making using attachments impossible. I was furious that Dyson did not cover the hose under warranty, so I bought an aftermarket hose. I got the groom tool a couple months ago and tried to use it on the hose, but it did not fit (so I thought, it actually just required about 40 lbs of force to get it to lock I later found out). So I complained to Dyson that the grooming tool did not fit the hose. They would not believe me, so I made a youtube video showing how it did not work. They were then convinced and said I must have a defective hose and sent me a new hose, for free!I actually did not even consider that the aftermarket hose just had a tighter fit than the original and required a lot of force to use it until I got the OEM hose. I tried it and the grooming tool easily snapped on. Then I compared the aftermarket and oem hoses and they looked the same, so tried it with the aftermarket hose, now realizing it just required more force to seat the tool, and it did snap on.So, due to the grooming tool, I got Dyson to do the right thing and send me a replacement hose, like they should have done when the first one broke, so now I have a spare.As far as the grooming tool's function itself, it works great.

I can honestly say it's one of the few pieces of tech that truly makes me smile every time I use it. Of all the devices: phones, computers, games, and various other electronics I own, my Neato seems the most futuristic and its impact is the most obvious and tangible.Cons first:You must clean out the bin with every useIf you've got long hair, you need to remove and clean the roller with every useYou can't just set it and forget it because it will get stuck somewhere or choke on a power cord, etcYou have to arrange some things in the room and find the ideal wall space to put the dock for it to ""launch""It's not nearly as powerful as a ""real"" vacuum--more like having a couple hand-vacs that crawl around the floor getting in all the nooks.It will invariably miss a few easy pieces of dirt or lint in plain-view in the middle of the room.To get the best results I need to pick up the vacuum and reposition it (the dock) in each room I want to cleanBatteries and price just generallyPros:This can replace 70-90% of your vacuuming.It literally does the job for you, as if you hired someone to do the jobYou can't compare this to a Dyson etc., because with those, you still have to do the job...this actually does it for you!It cleans better than I would because it gets under furniture and in little places that I wouldn't bother with on a day to day basis.Once it maps the perimeter of the room, it leaves nice little clean patterns in the rug as it fills in the shapeIf it misses something, just run it again!Clean floors, all the time!Some reviewers complain about the machine getting lost or choking on something but in my experience (about 4mos) it means you need to put the dock elsewhere and remove the clutter before you start the vacuum. But this is a non-issue for me because you need to clear the clutter even with a conventional vacuum. What I love most is starting the vacuum in one room while I work in another. I return in half an hour and the room is clean and the Neato is recharging. We have wall to wall carpet and this thing saves me so much time every day. I love it! If you measure your expectations, and take care of your machine, maybe you'll love yours too.I can't wait for the next gen of these things. A little more power, larger bin, better software, etc.EDIT - SIX MONTHS LATERWell for some reason the motor died and I'm looking for a new vacuum again. What a disappointment, but not totally shocking considering what I bought was probably a refurb that had been sold as ""new in box"" by a sketchy seller ""Christine's Store"".

So, I bought the Roku 2 as a Christmas gift.  I had done research and heard a lot of great things about what the Roku can do that the Apple TV cannot.  I should have researched more.I guess we were lucky that ours quit before the 3 month mark, instead after, like everyone else's.  We have been using this thing for about 4 weeks, and it simply stopped.  no picture, no screensaver.  I used the manual to trouble-shoot (after doing all of the normal stuff one does to trouble-shoot a computer device).  That's when everything went horribly wrong.Roku's not so helpful ""help desk"" is one of the very worst I have ever dealt with. I used to work the phones, so I understand the process from both sides.  I tried explaining to the operator the things I had done to troubleshoot, but he refused to listen.  He insisted on going by the 35 minute trouble-shooting script... step by fricken step.Once we determined that the unit was actually defective (which I had already told them), they told me to call Amazon and return it to them.  I informed him that it was past Amazon's 30 window.  He told me to call Amazon and then call back if Amazon said no.  I called back after verifying that my return window had expired and got someone else.I was very thankful, until I realized we were going to have to go through the same steps.  I had to interrupt the lady and tell her three times that I already did this until finally I told her to look up my call from 10 minutes prior so that we would not have to go through everything all over again.Finally she said the unit was defective and since Amazon would not replace it, she would see if they would.  She told me to hold for 5 minutes while she contacted a manager.  She came back and said that they would replace it, but I would have to ship mine back before they would ship out a replacement.  She said I would be getting an email hopefully within 48 hours, with the instructions on how to ship it.I thought Roku was supposed to be a reputable company. I should have stuck with Apple TV.

However, the features that distinguish it from its lower-priced brethren are its weakest.  Voice commands could be great, if they didn't require me to shout, leaving me feeling exhausted like after a big argument, every time I entered an address.  As pointed out by many, one cannot simply say the name of a favorite, but has to scroll down infinitely, until that favorite is one of three displayed on a screen page.  After some fun laughing at wrong guesses, voice commands became a distraction, waste of time, and something to avoid.  I actually was forced to avoid them altogether, because the device often froze after being told ""No"" several times in response to its ""Is that correct?"" prompt.  It did not take rejection well, and showed it by requiring a hard reset, and sometimes even refusing to reboot at all for 10 or more minutes.  Similarly, I found traffic quite useless, as the information displayed was unreliable.  For me, acting on information, in this case by taking a different, usually longer route, requires some degree of trust.  It would perhaps be acceptable if it were wrong once or twice per month, but in my one-week experience, the traffic info displayed by the device in my area (Tampa bay), was usually wrong.  I did not find ads to be a nuisance, as ads were displayed only when the car was stopped.  At the same time, they were as useless as those on TV, as I did not feel an urge to stay at the local Hampton Inn while a mile away from my actual home, a fact that the 2460LMT should have guessed from my ""Home"" setting.  Similarly useless was ecoboost, with a colored leaf indicator, which showed a running eco score.  With an optimum around 55 mph, the slower or faster the speed the lower the displayed score, until it went to 0 at about 90 mph.  I did not see any utility to such ""information"".  The same function, after entering my city and hwy gas mileage, fairly decent for my Accord, somehow managed to calculate truck-like gas mileages at higher speeds, mileages that had nothing to do with reality.  Ultimately, I would have still kept the device if it were not for the freezing issue, one that may have been specific to my particular device.  As it was, I returned it, and bought the 2450LM, which thankfully does not even pretend to have the functionality described above.

The bottle has good feel to it, seems to be stronger than the old one (good) and stubbier and shorter (good).

This happens the two bottles I received.  After you turn the cap about one turn, it stops but has a gap of 3-4mm from the shoulder of the bottle. Then you need to press hard and turn more until the cap stops at about 1mm from the bottle's shoulder. I had similar problem with the old bottles but that was developed after several months of usage. The new bottles have this problem from day 1.Another issue with the new design is that it does not fit well standard bottle cages. The old design had a recesses around the bottle that fit that long stopper at the top of standard water bottle cages. The new one does not and thus that part of the cage press hard against the bottle side.Considering that Vincero Design is basically a one product shop, I would expect them for more attention in designing there flagship product or at least not to regress the design.BTW, the product picture Amazon show me now is of the older design.

While the ""fin"" motif design is undeniably cool to look at, I can't help but wonder exactly what use is intended for this knife.  It's too large and heavy for most fine work, but its design isn't really optimized for use as a woodworking survival blade (fairly shallow grind, relatively thin blade, weak tip, etc.).  Its aggressive styling, tapered top edge (presumably could be sharpened...), and sharp pointed glass-breaker at the pommel suggest a tactical or fighting knife, but the handle design really allows only one reasonably secure, conventional grip position (i.e. no good overhand grip).  The curve of the knife and handle ergonomics also yield a somewhat unusual almost kukri-like forward sweep to the blade.  I imagine this might be handy for chopping, but it makes blade handling seem a bit less intuitive for other applications.While I am a fan of Kydex sheaths, this one has a couple quirks.  First, the handle retention strap with snap closure sits too low on the belt loop (close to the top of the sheath), mainly as a result of the curvature of the handle.  This, combined with the position of the sheathed knife's center of gravity, means that the knife will tend to flop around if suspended using the belt loop alone.  The second issue I encountered is that the blade was initially an extremely tight fit in the sheath, to the point where repeated insertion and removal of the knife started to wear smooth spots on the textured paint coating the blade.  This seems to have improved over time, particularly after oiling the blade, but there has clearly been some surface-to-surface wear along the way.  Now ""broken in,"" the sheath provides security, but also an easy draw...thankfully no longer a two-hand operation.Overall, this knife is a great value for the price...just keep in mind that it's a bit of a triumph of form over function.

The other reviewers assured me that it is solid, and the marketing blurb said it was safe up to 250 lbs. So, I took the plunge and trusted them.  I don't regret it at all.  This is solid gear, there is no bending or wobbling under my weight (160 lbs), and even my brother (260 lbs) didn't appear to stress it out at all.  Great for pullups, both wide and narrow grip, you can even do parallel grip, chin ups, dips, knee and leg lifts, pushups, and situps.Minus one star for poor instructions, but that might be because I'm not at all mechanically inclined.  At any rate, I had to enlist help to put the thing together.

This is basically the users input interface, besides being the ""just the screen"". The usefulness of a tablet is directly proportional to the quality of it screen. This is one thing that manufacturers and users or buyers should always keep in mind.I bought this Coby Kyros last April 2011, and so far I haven't actually enjoyed it. It is slow, period, there is no question about it. But I can live with it, I got what I paid for, I expected it.My main difficulty is using the Coby Kyros touch screen. For example if I want to manage my applications, naturally I will have to scroll through the list of applications. In doing this, I really have to be really really soft with my finger or stylus swiping, because one very little unintentional touch on an application will open it! And that is not what I want, I only want to scroll through the list.I wish there is a real ""scroller"" at the sides of the screen so I won't have to touch the screen when I just want to scroll either vertically or horizontally. As it is, this simple scrolling becomes so messy, and giving me a lot of frustration. This touchscreen is so sensitive to pressure. And you can't read the screen out in the open, there is so much glare!This problem must be addressed. This is really important because with this problem, a user cannot really run anything happily on this tablet. Maybe some calculator apps  are ok, but why not just buy a real calculator. The AMAZON app itself for this table t sucks. It just gives me product recommendations, where is my wish list, etc.? Well, you go to HELP and then login again, and then it will bring you to the amazon website. For me, this is simply like giving me a link to the website, and not a real app. I just deleted that app, listen guys, it sucks! I have a 7-inch real state, that app logo would occupy some of it, and it doesn't give me anything but ""offerings"" to buy?! This app is a bad example, but I should say that even if an app is good, you won't probably enjoy it on this Coby screen, it boils down to that.This Coby product is not good. My experience with it seems to give me an impression that I wish they did not make this a touch screen tablet! Because, they did not make it right anyway! I know this is a resistive screen and not a capacitive screen like those of iPods or iPhones, and my expectations should be lowered, but man, that expectation shouldn't be so low that it should almost be touching the ground. That simply won't do it anymore. I couldn't sleep tonight without writing this review. I want them to understand what a user like me wants to do or to have.Lesson here is this, I got what I paid for, which is a piece of cheap.

This time Mickey comes with 4 original songs, at least 15 wild and crazy dance moves! He jumps from a handstand right into a 360, a windmill, 4 interactive dances, humorous lines, snappy comments and the kids can try these moves themselves and learn a bit more about dancing.This fun toy may well stimulate your child into creating unheard of newer moves after the stimulation of the M3 because after a few turns with Mickey, the kids will be advanced players in the dance world (for 2-6 year olds at least). The kids can Press his nose to hear original tracks as well, as some older ones, as Mickey does ""The Handstand,"" ""The Mouska Mix,"" ""The Windmill,"" ""The Spin Cycle,"" and the rest of several other ""funky"" Mouska moves!Master Moves Mickey Mouse is also easy on the grownups, because although it mentions that it comes with the six AA batteries which must be installed and that inserting them is the only Assembly Required, the one I received came with batteries already loaded, so, there is a time saver. However, parents will still need to Free Mickey from his packaging, with a few snips of a good scissors, and also must remove the Plastic Tab on the back of his neck which was placed there in order to limit his actions in the boxed, Demo mode.This Master Moves Mickey Mouse (M3), is a great improvement over previous such toys and though I think it is a great plaything, in my experience kids at the top end of the age limit shown may find it a bit boring after a few rounds with it as did our  five year old.

The problem is that the TV cannot be used as a stand alone monitor without the use of a VGA emulator which will run you an addition $50.00 to $100.00. The emulator is to trick your computer into thinking that a different monitor is hooked up to your computer. Otherwise you have to boot up your computer with a different brand computer monitor then disconnect the old monitor replacing it with the Coby monitor. Any changes to resolution will lock up your computer and render the Coby monitor useless. The problem is that the TV does not communicate with the computer and identify itself as a monitor. In other words the TV gives no EDID information to the computer.  Because of the communication problem, the emulator is required for this to be used as a stand alone monitor.

However, the basic problem with this game is the initial conception - that WWII can be isolated to just the European theater. The mere concept demonstrates the game's limitations. What if the British are pressured in India? What if the Japanese increase garrisons in Manchuria? Even if the Japanese would get stomped by trying once again for Siberia (as they were encircled and crushed in the late 30's), it would still force the Russians to choose between two very difficult problems, and possibly increase garrisons at the expense of the German front, since defending Siberia is a very economical form of defense. What about the war in the Pacific? Are America's resources being funneled into that theater in the proper force levels? All of these would help the Germans in different ways. Instead, we're asked to turn a blind eye to these issues, and pretend that nothing else affects the European theater.Although this game adds some very interesting rules that were clearly needed in the original game, the problem with this edition is that it is incredibly limited at the stategic level. Without the Japanese, and the theoretical possiblity (although, in reality, impossibility) of squeezing the British economically with both Axis players, the game offers fewer choices, much like the actual conditions presented to the Germans in WWII. The Germans can do two things: build a big navy, and hope to conquer Britain, or build a big army and hope to conquer Soviet Russia. Hybrid strategies are doomed to failure, unless you're playing your little brother or geriatric grandmother. You might say, &quot;that's the way it was&quot; but only if you concentrate on the Germans. That's why they call it World War II - because it was worldwide.Even though the destroyers and fighter interception rules add some much-needed realism at a more tactical level, it actually is less realistic strategically. In many ways, the original is fun not so much because it's a &quot;realistic&quot; representation of WWII (which it most clearly is not, except in very minor ways) but because of all the strategic options available, and when you consider all of them, it's like a modernized (albeit simpler) version of Chess. In this edition, you buy either tanks or ships as the Germans, and everything is totally predictable. My sincere hope is that the Pacific edition will be more versatile, and require more thinking for veteran players. If you're an average or below-average player, you might enjoy this game for awhile longer.

I was able to screw the brackets in place, but the screws did not go into the anchors perfectly.  I went to mount the glass shelf in place and found that there was no means of supporting the weight of the five inch deep, 1/4&#34; thick glass shelf other than the two small set screws which held it in the wall brackets.  There is nothing to extend out under the shelf to support its weight. This revealed the final problem, the anchors were too small for the 1/4&#34; holes the instructions specifically instruct you to drill.

So even though it was the sellers fault I have to pay the shipping cost? Anyway I sent it back and I was notified that they (Electro Master the seller) had received it and would issue a refund. I said in leu of a refund just send me the correct armband. So I guess they sent me something because they also sent me a USPS tracking number, so I tracked it and after a few of days I noticed no activity. I notified Electro Master of this and they said the USPS has the package and to contact them, I told them that as a seller you should contact the USPS. They said when they receive the package back they would issue a refund.

It will fall out if the case is held at any angle. I get the impression that the strap will soon break as the Streak is too heavy for it. (Mine had a sticker on its outer plastic protection wrap stating it was for Kindle 2; perhaps the Kindle 2 is much lighter in weight than is the Dell Streak 7.) In addition, the strap is not centered in the case but is offset, making it much more likely that the Streak will fall out. The case could really use two such straps and they should be far more robust.When the case is closed, the Streak 7 slides around a bit within it. It is not a perfect fit.The case also has a mesh pocket on its other lid which, as the case is not deep enough, cannot hold the Streak's power supply, detachable plug, and USB cord. (However it can hold the USB cord alone as well as a few SD cards.) Another suitable case is necessary to carry those power supply items about.When the Streak is placed into the case, the speakers are very slightly muffled even with the case fully open. With the case closed, the speakers are more than 'slightly' muffled.In other words, for proper use, the Streak should be removed from this case.It might have helped if it had had some small openings where the speakers are located.While this case is nice looking, fairly well made, and is adequate (I think it will last for quite a while), when closed, for carrying the Streak, it strikes me as something one would buy at a dollar store. (The zippers are particularly chintzy.) I wish it had come with a wrist strap. Frankly, I think its price is far too high for what one gets.I am keeping the case and I shall continue to use it but I have to state that I am slightly disappointed.The 3-star rating means just what it is supposed to mean: ""It's OK.""The Vangoddy Store's packaging and shipping service were excellent.",3.0,A Barely Adequate Case for the Dell Streak 7,1304467200,"05 4, 2011",Electronics,"{'CS': 0.742693318, 'MNR': 0.0, 'RB': 0.0, 'RC': 103.0, 'PR': 96.11650485, 'NR': 1.941747573, 'FR': 0.13592233, 'RSP': 0.0, 'AW': 2397.0, 'RD': 0.0, 'RL': 2338.0, 'ER': 0.0, 'PC': 3.40063762}",0.0

I saw no change in distance, but rather experienced a much higher ball flight. I used the club for a month and then determined that the extraordinarily high ball flight hurt my game more than it helped. For this reason, I gave my club to my dad and he had it reshafted to a regular Fujikura. My dad, a low ball hitter, saw a much higher trajectory accompanied by a tremendous increase in distance and is currently very satisfied with the club.Overall, the club is designed for the higher handicapped golfer. It has a large sweet spot and its misses are not as drastic. Control of the club, however, is an issue. Its weight and moment of inertia are not suitable for a highball hitter like myself.

By this I mean a cover that completely protects and encloses the iPad but opens up to provide an attached keyboard. Zagg makes a nice aluminum keyboard CASE for the first-gen iPad but I don't want a case.Since buying my iPad I have had it in the original iPad case, which I like very much (except no keyboard). I've used it with an Apple Bluetooth keyboard, which is great (and also what I use with my Mac daily). The main problem with that solution is the keyboard isn't attached. Also, the Apple BT keyboard is a bit slow to connect when you do want to use it, and it lacks iPad specific keys.Interestingly, the added weight of this Beatech product is almost exactly the same as the original iPad case plus the apple BT keyboard.As for feature review? It's cheap, obviously. At this price it has to be. I think the Amazon price has dropped since I looked at this originally. I got it for a couple bucks less on eBay but if I was buying one now would get it from Amazon.The design and form is what I wanted. The only issue is the keyboard. It is a rubbery membrane type (as expected). The trouble I have with it is keys repeating or not recording. If I slow down I do pretty well but I can't type fast on it without a lot of typos. Also, the only Shift key is to the left, and my habit is to use the one on the right so that slows me down.That said, if I want to use it for sending an email of any length it sure beats the onscreen keyboard. Without this product I would usually end up deferring such emails until I can use my Mac, or if out and about I might use my Android phone so I can dictate my response. As a result on a recent short 2 night trip I could leave my laptop at home. Leaving the iPad at home is never an option I like it so much.My final judgement? I WISH I had a newer iPad so I could get a better keyboard folio, but if you truly need a keyboard folio for a first gen iPad you are unlikely to find a better one. And at least the price is good.",3.0,A real and practical review from iPad first gen perspective,1339545600,"06 13, 2012",Electronics,"{'CS': 0.523925612, 'MNR': 0.0, 'RB': 0.0, 'RC': 4.0, 'PR': 75.0, 'NR': 0.0, 'FR': 0.25, 'RSP': 0.0, 'AW': 868.0, 'RD': 0.857142857, 'RL': 2221.0, 'ER': 0.0, 'PC': 3.798185941}",0.0

The Amazon web page says it's a NV5435u and if you read down further, it says the model is NV5423u. The 5435 model is the blue cover version while the 5423 has a cherry red cover; that's the difference - the product specs are the same otherwise as far as I can tell.  I needed a new laptop with a bigger screen and when first searching, I thought I should be able to find a 15"" screen or so at a lower price, considering how PC prices have dropped over time.  That didn't pan out, I ended up in the $450+ price range. I chose this one as it offers a nice 15.6"" widescreen, has alot of RAM and disk space and another feature I wanted was the HDMI-out connection so I can plug this directly into my HDTV.Once I got the laptop, I was very pleasantly surprised with the crispness of the display as compared to my Toshiba Satellite that's a few years old and also to my IBM Thinkpad from the office.  This Gateway screen at the default resolution has the sharpness you get with high-definition TV.  The difference in the display quality is very obvious - and I used to think my other laptops had very nice screen quality, but now they pale in comparison. Speaker quality is very good. I also like the keyboard, it's crisp, does not have that cheap feel to it and contains a numeric keypad, which I like.  My other laptops have Windows XP Pro, which I like and I'm always skeptical about the need for Microsoft to develop a new operating system, but the Windows 7 on here is quick to boot up and is user friendly.  The messages that pop up are a bit more straightforward and complete.The Gateway Games console is installed on it with a number of Wild Tangent games.  It was disappointing to find that my Trend Micro Internet Security software found the Cryp_Mangled virus in about 100 of the files related to these games.  I got rid of all of the games in the console, even the few that didn't come up with a virus.  Internet research indicated Wild Tangent has said that there's just some code in some files that looks like a virus, but isn't - other info on the internet says Wild Tangent is spyware.  To be on the safe side, I got rid of it all , rescanned and the PC is fine.  Gateway would be best off not pre-loading this on their machines. It sounds like a number of computer manufacturers preload this particular game package on their machines.

I've seen hand-embellished giclees that look almost like an original painting, even up close, with the texture of a real oil painting. This isn't one of them.It's not advertised as hand-embellished anyway. What you get with this piece is a decent-quality giclee (that's a print, on a high-end printer) printed on canvas, wrapped around a pretty lightweight/cheap frame with no hooks or hanging wire. There's no texture to speak of other than that of the canvas. Looking at it closely you can see a bit of the screen pattern of what was probably the scan of the original.It looks fine from 10' away, and that's what I got it for anyway - it's being used for staging my house to sell. For that, it will serve its purpose fine, as it does have presence and wow-factor from a distance. And it's certainly a step up from a poster. But don't get this thinking you'll fool all your friends into thinking it's an actual oil painting.If it had been $40 I would say it was a good deal. At nearly $100 for a mounted print on canvas, I'm feeling that I got a little bit ripped. Shame, because I love the Rio artwork and was hoping to get the whole set after seeing how this one looked. Now I won't be, unless I need to stage another house to sell!Addendum: in looking at the zoomed view of the artwork in the listing, it clearly appears that there is texture in the painting, like brushstrokes or palette knife strokes. In other words, raised paint/texture from the flat surface. This definitely does not exist in the item I received, there is no raised texture or paint strokes, just a flat canvas.

The hard to find keys are even harder to find in the dark as they are butted up against the num pad.Much of this would not be a problem if there was some space in between alphs keyboard & the numeric pad. Also, if the keyboard were lit it would be so much easier to use.

I'm not sure where the &#34;flathead screwdriver&#34; instructions came from, because there are no flathead screws on this product.

The problem is that the bottom tension bolt can't get enough &#34;bite&#34; against the pole so it pops right out.  The top tension bolt did screw into the pole, but the problem at the top is that it's just a basic hole, not a threaded screw hole - so when it was tight enough that the pole wouldn't wiggle around, the screw popped out.The holes should have been threaded inserts, and then we would have had an easier chance of getting a bite.So basically, neither tension bolt worked.To keep it from coming out we drilled a hole at the bottom of the pipe so the pipe wouldn't fall out of the stand, so while the pipe will never fall out of the stand, it wiggles around.  But without this, you'd never be able to move the stand because the pipe would have slid right out.Maybe it was designed for one of those crappy light weight $20 plastic shirts you can buy from a costume shop, but when dealing with a proper 14 gauge in 3/8&#34; links galvanized steel chainmail shirt, it wiggles around just when you look at it funny.I would have returned it but with the drilled hole and added shipping charges, it wasn't worth it.

Having read reviews, I fully expected to like it. But, today it goes back to the store.It was close. I liked the absence of cable thumping sounds when I run. That was my main attraction in the first place. The device fit my head well and I had none of the problems mentioned by some reviewers of ear pieces falling out of my ear. I liked the design and the controls were intuitive, easy to figure out and use right off the bat.Sadly, there are two flaws that are causing me to return the player today:1. The audio quality is just not good enough. During the first half of my run, I was listening to some early 70s music in which the bass was not as important. Although I would have liked a fuller sound, it was enjoyable enough and I was pleased. However, when that album ended, next up was some hard rock, in which the bass guitar and kick drum are essential components of the music. At that point, the lack of audio quality was just too disappointing.My disappointment was not the disappointment of someone used to the bass heavy mix so popular with new music. I sometimes have to turn down the bass on some newer audio systems, for example on the audio system that came in my newest car. The NWZW262 could actually use some bass boost to achieve what is called a ""neutral"" mix.I experimented with fit, adjusting the headset to make sure the buds were more firmly and deeply inserted into my ear. This helped a little, but not enough.The audio highs are not crisp either. But, with the wind and other environmental sounds during a run, this didn't bother me as much. It actually reminded me in a pleasant way of the sound of my 70s era audio equipment.My regular mp3 player for the past several years has been a Sony NWZ-S718F player, which they don't make anymore. It sounds pretty good. But the cable thumping sound during runs has always been irritating. Despite this, it is preferable to the anemic sound from the NWZW262. I didn't expect the new device to sound as great, but not THIS inferior either.2. The final factor in returning my new walkman is physical discomfort. It is slightly uncomfortable to wear. Only slightly. In fact, if the sound was better, it isn't so uncomfortable that I would return it. But it is markedly less comfortable that the simple earbuds I am used to.Unlike with regular earbuds, the headset of the NWZW262 exerts some pressure on its earbuds which gets transferred to the ear. Regular earbuds angle to the direction of one's ear opening. These earbuds are attached to a headset with a set angle. You have to adjust the entire headset to adjust the earbud angle. Thus, adjustment is somewhat limited. Again, it is not a big discomfort, but discomfort nonetheless.I think this kind of headset mp3 player is a great idea. I look forward to see how it develops in the future. With improvement in audio quality and more comfort, it could be an advance over mp3 players with wired earbuds.",2.0,Almost Good Enough,1329609600,"02 19, 2012",Electronics,"{'CS': 0.761820169, 'MNR': 0.0, 'RB': 0.0, 'RC': 4.0, 'PR': 75.0, 'NR': 0.0, 'FR': 0.0, 'RSP': 0.0, 'AW': 845.0, 'RD': 1.897810219, 'RL': 3025.0, 'ER': 0.0, 'PC': 1.598360656}",0.0

I must be getting the boots that you are sending back. jk;) Seriously though I would like to say that this is my very first review ever so I apologize in advance for it being so long. (that's how strongly I feel about this) I am so disappointed in these boots. When I received my first pair a week and a half ago they looked and smelled so good-I was very excited. But when I tried them on immediately I noticed that the left boot was much smaller than the right one. On further review the right boot had a small piece missing from the wood part of the sole. I was ok with that however the seam was coming apart above that. Reluctantly I sent them back for an exchange in hopes to get two boots that ""felt like"" the same size. I just received my second pair today and seriously I'm embarrassed but obviously these problems are wide spread and very well known by whomever is shipping them out. This time the right boot was smaller but that wasn't even the real problem. One boot was entirely a different color and texture than the other. One was brown and the straps were a light buff color while the other boot was brown with the toe and heel being shiny black. What's more it was obviously sprayed with black paint or something because the same black color was also on the boot part where it appeared like spots that when the strap was moved you can see the over spray of whatever was sprayed on it before delivery. Evidence of this was also found on the card board paper that was inside the boot possibly put in it while it was still wet because it was stained with it too. Obviously, there are serious issues with these boots given some of the other reviews but for the cost (I paid $169) Amazon should not allow many of these boots to be sent out. Amazon needs to research this and fix the problem today. This is an embarrassment. I am sending them back and won't be ordering any more as I do not have time to play crap shoot to hope for a matching pair nor to deal with the shipping.

Worse, there seemed to a risk of breaking the ventilator grille, and dropping the iPhone.However, using the suction cup to windshield mount, I was able to securely mount my new iPhone4 just above and to the right of the steering wheel, comfortably within my field of view, but not obscuring the road ahead.  And this position makes it easy to put fingers on the iPhone screen, for using road navigation apps.  IMHO, this is a big safety improvement over needing to glance down and reach down to a lower position, like those cigarette lighter mounts.  That is why I give top rating of 5 starts to this Kensington K39256US car windshield mount.This Kensington gooseneck has the right combination of flexibility and stiffness to hold the phone without vibrating or sagging.  This is important when using road map navigator apps, where you need to accurately target screen buttons and accurately make two finger gestures.Despite what the video shows, I found the ""Quick-Release"" to be a two handed task.  IMHO, you really can't safely mount or unmount an iPhone, while driving, with one hand.I ordered this car mount for an aging iPhone3, which needed to be replaced with an iPhone4, before this Kensington mount arrived.  I found that this mount holds either iPhone securely.  And this is  despite the iPhone4 being larger, and encased in an OtterBox brand Impact series silicone cover.Back to my disappointment in not getting a mount with some capability to amplify an iPhone's sound --My goal is to make use of apps on the iPhone, for audible turn by turn road map navigation.  Based on less than sage advice, I purchased this Kensington mount and one of those FM broadcasting modules, but found that combination impractical.  See my one star review of the Belkin F8Z343 TuneCast Auto 4 for iPod and iPhone, titled ""I don't recommend ANY of these FM transmitter gadgets"".  In my experience, there are not enough unused FM frequencies.Belkin F8Z343 TuneCast Auto 4 for iPod and iPhoneIf you want to make use of audible turn by turn directions, you really need some kind of device to amplify the sound coming out of your iPhone.  I don't yet have any clear ideas, but IMHO, this task requires either a mount with built in amplifier, or an audio output device that connects your iPhone directly to your car radio.  Newer cars have a jack to connect by audio cable, eliminating any interference or latency.  Recently, I learned that for older cars, there are kits that can tap into the car radio antenna, whether FM radio, or old fashioned AM radio.  I have not yet tried one of those kits.  One example is the Audiovox FM100A FM Modulator, carried by Amazon.com, atAudiovox FM100A FM Modulator with IST2 Isolation Transformer (Grey)A bluetooth headset paired to my iPhone was a disappointment.  I found it very difficult to simultaneously operate a bluetooth headset and drive a car.  Worse, probably to conserve battery power, a bluetooth headset has a latency that causes it to drop the first second or so of each turn by turn instruction.  Very annoying, to need to hit the repeat button!I now wish that I had purchased a mount with some kind of practical sound amplification, that would make it possible for hands free use of my iPhone as a telephone, and let me hear the turn by turn directions.  But such a mount might possibly NOT be available.

Originally I found that it did need some color adjustment as the blues were too strong.  I have not changed it around that much other then deciding what was the best picture mode (changed from Brilliant to Bright) along with changing the color temp (from cool to warm).When I first powered on the TV, I did notice some ""screen door"" effects that seem to be inherent to DLP televisions but after living with it for a while I don't even notice it at all.  The picture is larger than life and extremely bright (much more so then the display had when in the store - especially compared to the flat panels).  I have viewed the picture on the following sources:1080i HDTV via HDMI (Verizon FIOS): Excellent.  However, with a TV this size you start to see which channels skimped on the budget (*cough*...TNT....*cough*).  On the good HD channels the picture is amazing.  On the ones that did it properly (FOX, NBC, etc) it is great.  I hate to say it, but you start to see how bad some of the actor's skin is because the picture is so large...lol.480i SDTV via HDMI (Verizon FIOS): Good.  Since having a rather large selection of HD channels to choose from I do not watch much SD programming.  Still, when the mode of the TV is set to narrow (4:3 - bars on the sides) the picture is good.  Not great, but I would not expect much from SD once you have watched HD.1080p HD BluRay via HDMI (Sony Playstation):  Truly Amazing.  I have only watched one movie via BluRay (Resident Evil: Extinction) and was completely floored.  I cannot claim that the difference between 1080i and 1080p is that great, but having a disc encoded for HD is obviously better than a broadcast channel.  I have played a few games as well and the picture is amazing.  I did notice one or two jagged lines, but I cannot say if that was the source material or the TV.  Nothing crazy though.480p via Component Video (Nintendo Wii): Very Good.  Originally I had my Wii hooked up via composite and it looked pretty bad.  I quickly ordered a component video cable and was much happier with the picture.  I think a lot of the issue is that I got so used to HD that Wii's lesser SD picture was just not as good.  With the new component cable the picture has improved dramatically, but has jagged lines (that is the Wii, not the TV as others have reported the same).The thin bezel (1/2"") around the TV makes the picture look even larger and less cluttered and is one of the main reasons I was drawn to this TV (not to mention that a comparable flat panel would be $26,000!).  The funny thing is, on my stand it looks like a flat panel to me as all you see is pretty much screen.All in all I am so happy I made this purchase (as is my wife).  I now have been spoiled and my next TV will have to be even larger ;)Pros:- Amazing, bright, clear, sharp picture- Does not take up a ton of space - depth is only about 17""- Minimal distance viewing requirements (I am about 10' away)- Light weight ~ 95 lbs.- Very handsome cabinet- Auto-sensing inputs (only enables an input if there is something plugged into it which prevents you from having to scroll through unused inputs).- Variety of picture settings (not that I can figure them all out ;) )- Bargain: $2,200 for 73"" of screen.  Can't go wrong with that!Cons:- Switching between inputs takes a few seconds- Speakers are a joke.  I think I would get better sound out of a Pringles can!  Having a home theater is a must.- Lamp gets hot.  Not much of an issue if you have clearance around the TV (manual suggests 4"") but if you have this built into an enclosure it may need additional cooling.- Vertical viewing angle: I have this on a rather tall stand and the picture looks it's best when the middle of the screen is at eye level.  My review is viewing the TV from my seated position but it could be even better if I had a lower stand.- Long power-up time on energy saver mode: I read that the power consumption when off for the ""quick"" power mode is quite a lot so I switched to the low power mode.  It can take up to 30 seconds to get a picture.  Since I only turn the TV on once a day I was ok with this to save a few $$$ in electricity.Summary: I could not be happier with this purchase.

I was leary because I was not real happy with my other camera and was actually happy to have lost it. After reading reviews and looking at the things this camera could do, I took a chance and bought this newer, MUCH BETTER, version. I LOVE this camera!!! First, Im not sure why someone else had battery trouble, but I have taken this camera to every party and have taken well over 100 pics and some video and my camera has never died. I do fully charge it before I leave, and I always take my charger just incase (its small enough to throw in my purse or car), but I have never needed to use it!Now, Im not a professional and Im not going to write a detailed description of ISO, and lighting specialties ect. I will leave that to the real professionals. What I will say is that it takes great pictures and it does so with ease. I dont have to change the scene, it automatically detects what I need (LOVE THIS FEATURE). I never really new what scene I needed anyway! Plus, by the time I would pic a scene the photo op was usually over anyway. I like to literally point and shoot! Thats what these cameras are supposed to be for anyway, right! But with the auto scene feature the camera is always ready to go! and it catches the greatest shots! and fast!! I can not tell you how important the quickness is when trying to take a picture of my 2 year old. Which brings me to another great feature...there is a smile detection setting!! You can set this camera to recognize when someone smiles and it takes the shot!! I didnt believe it until I tried it. And you can actually set it to detect just the childs smile, if you are taking a pic of with multiple people in the photo! Im not sure how the heck this works, but it is amazing and I am impressed!There are so many other great features! I also LOVE the video capability. This camera has stereo recording, which puts this about 100 bucks higher than the same camera without stereo, I think its worth it because I find Im using it instead of my regular video camera. It has 3 recording levels, but even at the lowest you get a good quality video with great sound!The editing functions in this camera are great too! There are simple actions as well as fun and (a little strange) options. There is actually an option to turn someone frown upside down! Seriously, if you take a photo and the person doesnt smile, you can edit it so that it looks like they are. Weird, right? But it is fun and a conversation piece anyway!I could go on and on, but I am so glad I got this camera!",5.0,Best Camera Ive Ever Owned.

While the older MAP76 model included a database of coastal navigational aids (buoys, lights, nuns, cans, whistles, gongs, lighthouses, etc), this model DOES NOT include any of these.  If you turn on this model and scroll over to Boston Harbor or San Francisco Bay, it will show you where the water is and where the land begins, but nothing more.  No navigational aids whatsoever.  Yes, it will give you lat/lon fixes like any GPS.  And it will give you speed and heading information.  But that's it.  Of course, Garmin tells you that you can purchase the detailed marine charts (they cost $100-$200 each for just a single area...in the Northeast, you would need to purchase many of these to get complete coverage) and this is understood.  But most serious boaters use detailed paper charts and/or a plotter and don't need their handheld for that kind of detail.  What a handheld is good for, however, is to show where you are in relation to a bell or a light you may be running toward in the fog or in the dark or in relation to a known waypoint.  The old version (MAP 76) gave you these bells and lights.  This one does not.  So unless you want to add many hundreds of dollars to your $275-$300 purchase price, this is the wrong model for a handheld GPS as backup.  Get the older MAP 76 instead.  For less than $200, you will have more than you need as a helpful boater's unit and no need to buy electronic charts.  Of course, the MAP 76 is B&W and not color, possibly less sensitive, and lacks all the bells and whistles.  But it is WAY more simple to use.  This MAP 76CSx is very complicated because it has built in all the highway, hiking, climbing, geocaching, urban features and capabilities that you will never use.  Just figuring out the setup takes hours.  Bottom line...Garmin is a great product.  But if you're a serious boater (not wanting to drop a thousand on a complicated handheld) and someopne who navigates with paper charts or a regular chart plotter, you don't want this model...you want the MAP76.

I own All-Clad pans for pan-searing and making sauces, three cast-iron pans for browning and searing, and numerous other pans, but the Calphalon Everyday pan is the one that I reach for the most, because it can handle such a variety of uses and does it so well.  The main advantage to it are the flared sides, which allow me to easily handle large sauces that would normally create a mess in a traditional 12-inch frying pan.  I frequently use it in place of a wok for stir frying, and it handles browning exceptionally well.  Even though it's a 12-inch pan, the flared sides make it act more like a 14 or 15 inch pan due to the extra room, while still taking up only minimal space on the burner.The pan is made of hard-anodized aluminum, which is a method for making cookware stronger and thicker.  Even after hundreds of uses, this pan still looks almost as new as the day I bought it.  It is not a no-stick pan, but it does have some lucubration properties and foods do not stick as badly as with other non-stick pans.  It cleans up very easily (anodized aluminum is easier to clean than bare aluminum). For tougher stains, I just rub it down with someBar Keepers Friend Cleanser & Polish: 12 OZand everything comes right off. Even after constant use I can spent 10 minutes on it with some Bar Keeper's Friend and get every single stain and smudge off it so it appears brand new.The conductivity of the pan is excellent.  It heats up very quickly, retains heat fairly well, and goes right into the oven.  The lid of the pan has a secure fit to prevent heat loss.  The pan is not too heavy, but is very sturdy and well made. I don't have any dents or scratches on it despite banging it around in my cabinets for years.I still love my cast iron for searing steaks and cooking bacon, and my All-Clad stainless for sauces and rouxs, but for everything else, I turn to the Calphalon Everyday.",5.0,"Truly an ""everyday"" pan",1318464000,"10 13, 2011",Home_and_Kitchen,"{'CS': 0.808193601, 'MNR': 0.0, 'RB': 0.0, 'RC': 148.0, 'PR': 80.40540541, 'NR': 13.51351351, 'FR': 0.060810811, 'RSP': 0.0, 'AW': 3849.0, 'RD': 0.989595376, 'RL': 2034.0, 'ER': 1.0, 'PC': 1.531862745}",0.0

We put it on the dashboard while driving and charged it up during the day and used it at night.One night while hanging out around the campfire, we had it on the arm of a chair. It slipped off and fell 2.3 feet to the ground and got a hole poked in it. The ground was very soft with no rocks. We tried to patch the hole with some duct tape, but even after cleaning the tape had a hard time sticking. The material really does need to be more durable.I will also agree with other posters that the valve needs work. It at least needs the little inner flap you find on any inflatable beach ball so it doesn't as soon as you take your lips off of it.Until it got the hole on the first drop we thought it was an awesome purchase. Now I recommend just getting a headlamp and saving yourself the trouble.EDIT:Original review left up for reference. LuminAID customer service contacted me and offered a replacement product.

This camera got good reviews regarding its operation and the pictures, etc....and so given the price, I figured I'd give it a shot. I usually buy items on Amazon using the customer reviews.  Seems to be the best way to REALLY tell how a product is.  This was no different.  After reading the 5 and 4 star reviews, it seemed like a good buy.  EXCEPT, that nearly ALL of the 1-star reviews was because the thing leaked...and leaked in far less water than the advertised depth... and quickly.  Given the total reviews and given the total 1-star reviews, I estimated that I had about a 4 out of 5 chance that I'd get a unit that didn't leak...and if that was the case...it would be a good buy (20% of the total reviews were 1-star, and every one of the many I read of the 1-star reviews, was because it leaked).And so in the end, I wasn't so lucky.  Used it in a 4ft pool (so no way the depth was exceeded).  I'm an Engineer for the Navy (Submarines), and I'm very aware how/why things leak.  I'm a designer of underwater electronics.  I checked this thing out fully prior to immersion in water.  Everything was as it should be (with respect to the seals that the user has access to).  But it leaked in about 15 minutes of use.Looking at its construction, while the battery compartment has a rubber cover, the rubber cover doesn't extend to a seam where the front assembly meets the battery compartment.  This, in my opinion, is the likely water path.  And it looks to be a DESIGN issue.  I'm sure they have something in there as a water-block, but it doesn't look like it to me.In my somewhat expert opinion about an item designed to operate underwater, I believe the design is flawed, and you will have about a 20% or more likelihood that the item will leak if used underwater, and probably a much higher likelihood if used underwater often.My guess is it's probably ok to buy if you want to use it in the rain, etc.  But as an underwater camera, don't bother with this one.",1.0,"Took a chance, but it leaks.",1372464000,"06 29, 2013",Electronics,"{'CS': 0.0, 'MNR': 0.0, 'RB': 0.0, 'RC': 0.0, 'PR': 0.0, 'NR': 0.0, 'FR': 0.0, 'RSP': 1.0, 'AW': 0.0, 'RD': 2.661780105, 'RL': 2124.0, 'ER': 1.0, 'PC': 0.834824091}",0.0

Not even close.Nothing has changed at all since owning this, except for the much higher energy bills that I now have each month.To be honest, I really feel like this is a scam. David Oreck and his family have said that this will clean an a entire standard-sized room 2-3 times a hour when the unit is left on.This is a complete lie.Since giving this unit time to work for these couple of years, I can tell you that this simply is totally untrue.I still have the same amount of dust in my apartment as I had before I got this, and there's no reduction in overall dust whatsoever.In fact, after I turned the unit off for an hour to observe the large build-up of dust STILL on my TV and surrounding items,I turned it back on, only to see a VERY LARGE dust cloud blow OUTWARD into the air that had accumulated on top of the Oreck unit!Not only had the unit FAILED to get rid of the dust, but it also BLEW it out into the air I was breathing.In theory, this unit is SUPPOSED to REMOVE the dust from the air, but it only BLOWS it into the air, giving me a greater opportunity and chance for respiratory problems later.Gee, thank you very much David Oreck.Not only is this unit worthless, but so is their sales and service staff that I made contact with at their local Oreck stores.Their sales and service guy was EXTREMELY rude to me, and it took them 3 weeks to get my Oreck serviced, when it was only supposed to take 3-4 days at the most.Even when I called to complain about this to the Oreck company on the East Coast, I was placated with feeble attempts at understanding, and was then offered a bottle of their Air cleaner as a free gift for my troubles with their rude Oreck sales and service man, but they NEVER sent it to me, so they lied about that as well.I am DONE with Oreck, and never will buy or use their products ever again.

Unfortunately I got my first watch at another site, and paid nearly twice as much for it, a very similar style!  Live and learn; ALWAYS check Amazon first, before buying almost anything.  This watch is a bit bigger than the first one I bought, very similar in style, and a completely different color (first was black and rose tone, with crystals).  While I like this very much, I wish it were just a little smaller.  It is not huge, by any means, but I prefer a slightly daintier watch.  This is for casual wear, and very nice indeed for that purpose.  Being slightly larger (again, not truly big), it actually is rather stylish along the lines of a boy-friend watch.  It is not as large as a B-F watch, which is terrific, just larger than I normally would wear.  Eventually those will go out of style and will become very dated.  This is a classic style which I believe will look good for a very long time.  I like the mesh band on this one (and on my first one).  The only issue I have is that it is very difficult for me to close the clasp.  I had a similar problem with my first one, but I either got used to how to do it, or is just got ""broken in"" a bit with use.  I do find that this watch, being larger in all aspects, includig the mesh band, is less flexible.  It really is hard to get it closed.  I am hoping that in time I will get used to it, or that it will find its way more easily.  Other than that, it just about a perfect watch at a very good price.  As I considers watches to be jewelry, not merely timepieces, I am already looking at other Skagen watches.  However, I don't want to have a bunch that look too similar.  I am tempted, though, particularly by their ceramic watch, which is considerably different that those with mesh bands.  All in all I highly recommend this particular watch, as well as other Skagen watches.  How do they, I wonder, make such a classy, classic, refined and great looking watch for such a good price.  It is not like the cheapies, such as R#1!(, etc., and other such knock offs of watches in the low hundreds, nor what you would find at Walmart and other such stores, but the prices are nearly as good.  Truly, at these affordable prices, it is easy to justify buying more than one.Amazon, you are the best. I shop with you more than almost anywhere else, except for clothing (although I have purchased some clothing, too).  Also love MyHabit -- really neat things at exceptional prices, and not having to run from decorator store to store.  Free shipping on most things I buy, even free returns on some items, how can one go wrong?  I buy a lot of books, and many kitchen items and gadgets, most using the 4-for-3 promotion, so even more savings.  No wasted gas money running around, much less time spent shopping -- well, almost, as I am likely to shop almost every day!

The few customer reviews were mostly favorable so I ordered one.I did note some issues people were having with the Calphalon Commercial Hard Anodized 12-Quart Stockpot with Lid.  To summarize it was noted that the pot was not made in America, was flimsy and thin in construction, and the finish quality was substandard.  Being that I had already ordered, I waited to see what would arrive.I opened the Amazon box and took out the plain white box whose only markings were ""Made in China.""  Nowhere did it even say Calphalon, so this was an object never intended for normal retail sale (at a Macy's etc.).  The pot was indeed flimsy with comically puny handles.  I scratched at the surface with my fingernail and appeared to slightly mar the surface.  I then walked to my computer, clicked return, and printed out the return authorization.I think what disturbs me the most is if Calphalon is calling this piece of junk commercial quality, how can I possibly order one of their products unless I can physically touch it before I commit?  Claiming a 68% savings on the price of this pot is ludicrous.  This is more like one of those infomercials that packages 50 cents worth of plastic and says it's a $20 value.

Both of the satellites were blown within 3 weeks of partying.  This new Pyle loudspeaker is exactly what I needed. My house is not huge (about 1000 sq. ft.), but this speaker will fill the living and dining area with an overwhelming level of sound at 20% of it's volume.  For tailgating out front, the speaker was turned up to 50% and was louder than a backyard concert 2 doors down.  If you need serious volume for a small to medium size venue, this is your speaker.There are a few things that could be improved:-At any level of volume there is a VERY MILD humming feedback that is hardly noticeable unless there is no music playing,-The iPod docking station DOES ALLOW all generations and versions of iPod to be used for music, but no version of iPod Touch will charge, neither will iPods newer than 4th or 5th generation.  4th and 5th generation and earlier will charge in the docking station.-The sound is not crystal clear, but for the price that this speaker sells at compared to others like it, it is completely worth it.I have not tried out the microphone setting yet, but I assume it will work just as the iPod docking station and RCA inputs do.Overall, I am extremely pleased with this speaker so far. I have had it for only 2 weeks, but there is a 1 year warranty provided by Pyle. I do not anticipate any problems with the speaker, seeing as I only use it on the weekends.

Screen 'bruising.'  The build of the machine is sleek, lightweight, and attractive, with aluminum cladding on almost every surface except the bottom and the touchpad.  However, because the lid is so thin, the screen tends to 'bruise' against the keys.  It's not likely to be a problem with my carrying bag (I keep a padded sleeve *inside* a padded pocket and don't overload with other items), and I certainly hope it's not a problem with me simply grasping the computer to lift it out of its pocket, but it's disappointing all the same in terms of durability, especially since I have had mine only just over a year and tend to be *very* careful and protective.2.  Processor speed.  My machine has an AMD 2Ghz Quad-Core A10-4655M Processor, admittedly a lesser version of what is currently on sale.  It's my first non-Intel processor, and it's noticeably slower, at times much slower than I would like.  Things tend to lock up, although to the overall system's credit (I've largely left the system in factory-release configuration) they do tend to release in a few seconds unscathed.  Very few actual crashes, but the lag is frustrating.  I'm not a graphics user or gamer, either--we're talking about multiple browser tabs in a single window, a couple of moderately-sized PDFs, and 6 or 7 Word files open simultaneously (no specialized programs, pictures, or video), which a processor should really be able to cope with.I think I'd still consider another Samsung machine, but only with a much better processor and with some evidence that the screen isn't going to scratch and blur.

The seat of the chair is made of 5 or 6 thin horizontal s-curving metal rods bowed upward to suspend the seat cushion via anchoring to a slightly narrower vertical framework.  Ironically gravity is guaranteed to ware these down over a short period of time as the chair is used.  These rods are only suspended and are not supported.  This may be a sufficient design if the chair was reclined 100% of the time but I would guess, like me, many will use this chair often seated upright.  While upright the calf/foot rest does not tuck under the chair sufficiently in order to allow the user to back-up to the chair for a gentle seating and often causes a more forceful seating.  When your s-curving metal rods break, and they will, your retailer will disown you as the relationship between Human Touch and the retailer does not provide for adequate customer service from the retailer.  Since the chair is so expensive retailer inventory is refreshed 3 or 4 chairs at a time and not before that and thus they have no inventory.  Meaning you are likely to need a new chair shipped to you by Human Touch.  Ok, no big deal.  Except Human Touch is too concerned with bragging of the millions of dollars they've spend on design and the fact that professional athletes love the chair to care about customers in general.  To make your whole again, even under warranty, you will pay more than $400.00 to have a new chair shipped and set-up in your home.  That is more than 20% of the original exorbitant price of the chair that you will pay for Human Touch's POOR chair design.  This is a horribly inadequate business plan with no focus on customer satisfaction whatsoever.  The chair is adequately comfortable but the company is misguided and arrogant.  For the price I would NOT purchase this again and would urgently recommend you research alternative chairs.  PS, if you have kids DO NOT purchase this chair!!

I constantly run into this problem where the wireless adapter randomly decides to drop the signal and then I have to wait about a minute or so for the connection to reestablish. What I also discovered online is that this particular model of the wireless adapter (Qualcomm Atheros AR5BWB222 Wireless Network Adapter) has had a healthy amount of complaints against it regarding dropped wireless connections.

The touch screen keypad is just like a normal phone keypad -- not conducive for long text messages.  after many calls with customer service of TRACFONE, my phone still does not work.  I verified on-line with Tracfone before purchase, this phone would work in my area.  First call to Tracfone, they said it would take 1-2 hours.  After waiting overnight, I called customer service back the next day.  This time they said it would take 3-4 days for the phone to activate.  After waiting the required time, I called them back only to find out they needed to send me out a new sim card.  After replacing the old sim card with the one they sent -- my phone still does not work.  Calling them again, revealed the sim card they sent me is not valid in my area.  They will be sending another sim card.I really like this phone for my kids -- if Tracfone can ever get this phone to work.",2.0,Phone Okay - Tracfone Customer Service not okay.,1375056000,"07 29, 2013",Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,"{'CS': 0.942204253, 'MNR': 0.333333333, 'RB': 1.0, 'RC': 7.0, 'PR': 71.42857143, 'NR': 14.28571429, 'FR': 0.0, 'RSP': 0.0, 'AW': 538.0, 'RD': 1.623496762, 'RL': 1187.0, 'ER': 0.0, 'PC': 2.222222222}",0.0

I gave 1 star toWinDVD Pro 11, and I gave 1 star toPaintShop Photo Pro X3, and I gave 2 stars toDigital Studio 2010. You can say with confidence that I am NOT A FAN.So, if anything, my bias runs AGAINST Corel, not for them. So, imagine my surprise when I installed Pinnacle Studio 17, and it wasn't a complete train-wreck. I mean, don't get me wrong, I wouldn't choose Pinnacle Studio as my go-to video editing program, but it would certainly do for me in a pinch.I am a LONG TIME user of Adobe's Premiere Elements application for video editing, and I used that one suite for a long time (dating all the back to the 3.0 release), until Adobe ruined it. I am now using CyberLink's PowerDirector as my main video editing application, and I am pretty happy with it.I use video editing software for very specific purposes:1.) to cut together video for reviewsand2.) to edit together nice DVDs/Blu-Rays of family home videos to give out to friends and family, that include chapter breaks, and title screens, etc.Those are the ONLY two purposes that I use video editing software for. So, those are the only two sets of conditions I am going to review. A professional using the application might have more to say about various features, but those are outside of the scope of my usage or knowledge.[Note, I tested this application on a Windows 7 64-bit computer with a 8-Core i7 Intel processor running at 2.30GHz, with 16GB of RAM.]So, with my background established, it should be clear that video editing software is old-hat for me. One application looks and functions pretty much as well as any other application for me. I can pretty quickly and easily figure out how to preview the video, cut and edit the video, and export the video. They are all laid out basically the same. So, I had no problem getting around in Pinnacle Studio 17. However, if Pinnacle Studio 17 was my VERY FIRST video editing application, I think I would have been in trouble. It only comes with a little folded pamphlet to get you started, and the instructions are pretty anemic. In contrast, all of the editions of Adobe's Premiere Elements came with full-fledged books with manuals in them, to get you started, for all of the editions I bought, before I gave up on Premiere Elements.  And CyberLink's PowerDirector has tutorials on their website, and FULL documentation included WITH their application.  Pinnacle Studio has documentation as well, but it is only on their website, and that sucks.Additionally, CyberLink's PowerDirector is a native 64-bit application, and it takes full advantage of my hardware. In contrast, Corel's Pinnacle Studio 17 is a 32-bit application, and it doesn't take full advantage of my hardware.First things first, though, TURN OFF the ""Watchfolders"" (go to the Setup Menu > Control Panel > Watchfolders and click the ""Remove Folder"" button for all of the entries in there, then apply the changes) -- Corel is continuing their INSANE tradition of all of their other media applications of trying to be your media manager as well, by constantly monitoring your media locations in ""my documents"" and your ""documents library"" for videos, music, photos, etc. The end result of that, is that the stupid thing will CHUG when you first launch it, as it tries to index your ENTIRE HARD-DRIVE'S worth of media in the locations it is automatically monitoring. With that nonsense turned off, the monitoring agent will still be running, and eating up some of your RAM, but at least it won't be causing your system to freeze.Another annoyance of Pinnacle Studio 17, is that it installs a DRM watchdog application, NeroCheck, on your system without asking you (unless you actually read their 50 page user agreement in their term of use at install), that will run constantly on your system. (I find it hilarious that clueless companies like Corel are still trying to use DRM as a means to control copying their software, these people have no concept of reality. Newsflash guys, it doesn't work, has never worked, and all you are doing is aggravating your paying users, while the pirates continue pirating. Always-Online is the only way to slow/stop the copying, but that has its own issues we won't get into.)But, all of that being said, the key question is, can I get it to do what I need it to do? And the answer is, yes! Once the ""Watchfolders"" are turned off, the application is surprisingly useable, and pretty darn responsive. You can import your videos into a project (without having to actually copy the files), and you can preview them VERY smoothly. Editing them was no problem for me, and exporting them was a breeze. I did a trial edit, compile, and export to AVI, MOV and FLV format, at various settings, bit-rates, sizes, and custom settings, and the exported videos all came out very nicely. I then did a trial edit, compile and export to DVD with chapter breaks and a title screen, etc. and it came out nicely as well.Also, I will say, and tip my hat to the Corel developers, that of all 3 video editing products I have ever owned or used, the compile and render process for Pinnacle Studio 17 was INCREDIBLY fast! Even faster than CyberLink's PowerDirector, which is saying something.So, this application has the usual baggage from Corel, dragging it down, and I WOULD NOT classify it as a good entry-level editor for someone new to these kinds of applications. But, it did the job well in all of my tests once I turned off its most annoying ""features"" and I have seen and used far worse.3.5 stars (rounded down to 3 stars, since Amazon doesn't do partial stars.

Which makes the lid a pain to take off once your tea is done steeping.2. ) The infuser has an interesting spring mechanism to keep the infuser in place that I thought was going to be a fabulous addition.  It's a very sturdy latch.  This, unfortunately, doesn't help you take the infuser out once your tea is steeped.3. ) The infuser does have a very, very fine mesh, so much less tea 'dust' leaks out when you're steeping.  You'll still have some, especially from some of the finer mate blends, but much less than than I've had from other infusers.4. ) Strangely, the mesh stops about a half an inch above the bottom of the infuser.

Shredding softer cheese also caused the base to hop around, and a smear of cheese wound up in the groove in the lid adjacent to the feeding tube. I had to use a toothpick to clean out the blade edges and the lid before packing the whole thing up to return for a full refund.

First, the build phase is crazy as everyone works to put together a decently working ship in so little time. You have a variety of components available like weapons, cargo bays and even alien life support systems. But each component has to fit in a certain way based on the various connectors at the edges of each tile piece, so that adds other challenges to ship-building. Placement is truly key here and a well-designed ship can stand a good chance of surviving. But if you plot out your connectors badly, a single stray meteor getting through your defenses may result in half your ship breaking apart.In theory there's not much to be done about the Flight since the cards to be drawn will affect your ships no matter one. The only decisions you can make during the Flight are pretty much how you'll spend your battery charges for powering special double blasters or double engines. Energy is a limited commodity for the entire flight and thus you have to know when to spend for the best result. The other aspect is figuring out which cargo to go for and which cargo to ignore, especially since card interactions typically result in delays to your journey.The weird race nature of the whole trip is pretty interesting and the game includes a comprehensive system of bonus payouts for being first to arrive, having the prettiest (least damaged) ship and then of course there's your cargo. The expansions open up other ways to score with special alien roles or even VIP cabins that pay extra should the passenger make it all the way to the end.The expansions also provide new cards, new rules, new ship templates and of course new ship components! Thus you can have blasters that face in two directions, armor that cannot be destroyed by blaster fire or meteor strikes and combination tiles like cargo holds with battery packs. Figuring out what to use is never easy regardless of the tiles available since ultimately your connectors will end up limiting what your ship can do. Even the direction that your blasters face is important since threats can come from all sides.Galaxy Trucker may seem like a lot to take in at first glance, especially if you get this anniversary edition.

Too good to be true?  Yes.The most notable disappointment with this product is that the processor is only 2.0 Ghz, not 3.1 Ghz as advertised.  My current (much older!) Inspiron laptop is a 2.6 Ghz, so in terms of processing power, this is actually a downgrade for me, and considering that I use my PC for gaming, programming, and modeling applications, I'm not sure this is going to work for me.Also, despite the adequate packaging and the fact that Amazon overboxed the Dell package as well, this laptop has what appears to be screen tears or bubbles under the Gorilla glass in the upper left hand corner of the screen, as well as diagonal streaking originating from these tears that is visible from certain view angles.  The boxes were not damaged at all, I assume this is a manufacturing defect.Should I just eat it and enjoy my $1300 laptop that I got for only $800?  Probably.  Honestly I do like the product overall, even though I hate Windows 8 with a passion.  The touchscreen is responsive and everything I could have wanted for drawing.

It pairs and connects easily to one device at a time.What I like:Plenty of power, plenty of volume for almost every use. Charge lasts ~10 hours. Sound is better than smaller BT speakers, but not premium. If you get it on sale it's a real value. The finish seems rugged enough to not fear tossing in a pack, trunk or bag and hitting the trail.What I don't like:The charger is a brick and cord, not microUSB. The sound is tuned for EXTRA bass and EXTRA highs, not so much midrange, which makes the sound seem muddy. But most BT speakers on the market are tuned this way. The LED lights on top are VERY faint and hard to see. Plus, you have no idea if the device is on or off until you try to connect. Turning speaker on requires you to -just- touch the power button, as opposed to press and hold for a few seconds. This means if you pack it for a trip it will almost certainly accidentally power on and drain battery. The buttons are black. The body is black. Everything is black.

I will update this review when I get it.  It amazes me that this product can get 4 stars from reviewers who can't use their wireless rear speakers.  Isn't that the whole reason to get this product?The product does look beautiful, the sound out of the 3+1 working speakers is great, and everything that does work works perfectly and setup was easy.  However, I'm convinced that if you use an HDMI cable to connect the product to your TV, you will not be able to use your rear speakers.  This is a Sony design flaw, pure and simple.I'm hopeful that the signal booster (extension cable) Sony is sending (another 7-10 day wait) will resolve the issue.  If not, they will be getting back this product along with the Sony TV I got at the same time.  If the product issue is resolved, I'll update this review and probably offer up the 4 star review I hoped to give (5 stars is now out of the question given the time and frustration).  Sony told me they are getting lots of these calls.UPDATE 1:  A high-quality (expensive) HDMI cable helps.  With a new HDMI cable, the unit paired immediately and sound was great.  Additional update to follow upon receipt of signal booster from Sony.UPDATE 2:  Sony sent me the signal booster and I purchased an expensive HDMI cable.  Months later, I still occasionally see that I have to re-pair the speakers to the unit.  For some reason, they just periodically lose the connection.  Granted, it's easy enough to re-pair once you have the accessories, but it's annoying.  I generally love Sony products, but this one is just not worthwhile.",1.0,Unit does not work without special accessories,1245801600,"06 24, 2009",Electronics,"{'CS': 0.668958222, 'MNR': 0.0, 'RB': 0.0, 'RC': 1.0, 'PR': 100.0, 'NR': 0.0, 'FR': 0.0, 'RSP': 0.0, 'AW': 0.0, 'RD': 2.775862069, 'RL': 1869.0, 'ER': 1.0, 'PC': 3.326679973}",0.0

I use them together as designed.  The gel wraps fit my hands snugly and fit inside the gloves well enough, albeit a bit awkward.Every boxing and kickboxing class I have used them (3x weekly on heavy bags) has resulted in painfully bruised swollen knuckles!  I may hit a little harder than your average chick, but I have never had this issue with my old gloves and traditional hand wraps.  My wrists are also sore.  These gel wraps have an excessive roundness that appears to be ergonomically incorrect thus creating a slight roll on contact, simultaneously making striking with the flat portion of knuckles unnecessarily difficult.

The belt is $13, but, over $25 for the labor to put in a new one since it's virtually impossible for a normal person to change it, although the manual does warn you that if their ""LIFETIME"" belt DOES break, you pretty much need to hire someone to replace it.  Even the repair guy said it's one of the most difficult belts to get to that he's ever worked on, he has a difficult time. He also said this vacuum has a reputation for problems.  I contacted Hoover about it and they said that it's a ""lifetime"" belt if it doesn't go through any difficulties, like something caught in the roller.  They suggested I raise the level, too.  If I raise it any higher, the brush doesn't even touch the carpet.  So, basically, the belt lasts a lifetime if you don't use the vacuum the way you need to.  And when it breaks, it costs a fortune to replace.  Also, I'm so disappointed in their lack of customer service. Calling their number just gives you a recording that gives you the number of a repair person in your area.  You never get to talk to a customer service person.  I had to email my complaint to get hold of Hoover instead of a repair person, and there was no apology or sign of interest or acceptance of any responsibility.

It's two pieces. For the bottom half, you slip on the Macbook rear first to catch the 'hook' which lines the length of the inside rim of the case, then you just drop-click the front in. This is outlined in the 4-step instructions. The top half is just as easy. The top half is held in place by 4 small tabs, which snap on to the front LCD bevel.Make sure to clean the surface of your Macbook first-thoroughly. Don't let any particles get in-between the MBP surface and the case. The top half is really hard to remove. I was able to take it off by unclipping the two tabs on one side first. The first tab is easy, but the second was hard and required a plastic spudger, which I used to wedge it off. I did not find the 'secret' to getting the top half off without using something to wedge it off.My recommendation is to not buy this if you plan on removing the case frequently--it is just too inconvenient and you might break the tabs (on the top half) off while you do it.The case itself is beautiful. I really like the frosted look. You can obviously still see the Apple logo glowing in the back. The surface has as a nice soft texture to it that isn't slippery slick. Time will tell how it will look after months of use...but it's ok if it's worn-out--better the case than the Mac, right?MagSafe adapter issue:I gave it 3 stars because they didn't design this for the Late 2011 MBP in mind because the angled MagSafe adapter will only work if you hook it with the cable facing you (blocking the Ethernet). This is a non-issue if you don't use that port.  But something to consider otherwise.

I found this glass popper and gave it a try. I love it!!! It has a silicone lid with ventilation, and is a nice, small, one-person size. I use it almost every night to make a single 4-cup portion of popcorn for myself. If hubby wants some (and he seldom does) I just pop another batch for him. The perfect ""recipe"" for this popper (and my GE Profile over-the-stove type microwave as well) is this:  3 Tbsp Popcorn Kernels, Microwave on High for 2 min. 15 sec. (2:15)... if popping stops before that, stop the microwave.  This makes a 4-cup serving of low-calorie popcorn (only 60 calories!).  Now, if you want to add butter, oil, calories, etc., that's up to you. But I would not use the lid to melt anything on, because the corn won't all pop right. So I sometimes just melt some coconut oil on the side, mix it in good, and then sprinkle salt or Flavacol over it... Yum!The only thing I do not like is that some popcorn usually sticks to the inside of the glass, near the bottom. I am not sure why, maybe it's the Orville Reddenbacher kernels I am using. I will try switching to another brand and update my review here if that makes a difference. But I usually have to end up sticking my hand inside to scrape out the last of the popcorn that is stuck to the glass.

However, there was no USB modem driver included, so I had to hunt one down.

Media Player thinks it has to convert all the files it loads, even though the phone plays high grade mp3's just fine, so you may want to manually drag and drop music onto your phone.I put an 8GB Mini SD card in my phone before using the cable so I don't know if it would work without having an SD card--though without one you certainly won't have much space for music.TO GAIN ACCESS TO YOUR PHONE WITH BITPIM/USE AS A MODEM:BitPim allows you to download data like your calendar, contact list, messages, pictures and video onto your PC.I installed BitPim but it wouldn't talk to my phone because I didn't have a driver.  I looked around on all kinds of shady freeware sites but I'm too much of a novice to get anything to work.  Then I looked on [...] and found VZAccess Manager, which basically enables your phone to be used as a modem for your PC.  After installing it my phone is able to communicate with BitPim, and I have the ability to connect to the internet (although I would only use the phone to connect in a dire emergency since I'm not on any kind of data plan).If you're not a Verizon user I believe VZAccess Manager would still let your phone talk to a program like BitPim, though you probably couldn't use the internet.",4.0,"Verizon User: Loading Music, Data Back-Up, USB Modem",1243036800,"05 23, 2009",Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,"{'CS': 0.0, 'MNR': 0.0, 'RB': 0.0, 'RC': 0.0, 'PR': 0.0, 'NR': 0.0, 'FR': 0.0, 'RSP': 1.0, 'AW': 0.0, 'RD': 0.2, 'RL': 1645.0, 'ER': 0.0, 'PC': 9.419743783}",0.0

But, as I began to read the questions, I realized that there was the potential for a lot of the questions to go wrong or go in directions that I wouldn't be comfortable. The questions' topics held a lot of potential for hurt feelings, as another player said, and for potty humor to enter the game.  You'd have to be in a group in which everyone enjoyed potty or crass humor, or had very sarcastic senses of humor, or were committed to answer the questions innocently instead of taking them down other paths.  If the group all fell within one of those categories or the first two together, you'll probably enjoy the game.  The questions are creative and it would get people talking and laughing.  If on the other hand you're looking for a fun and innocent game--then don't get this one.Post script... if you are wondering why I didn't just take a few cards out and enjoy the game as is, well...  I thought about it and actually did that with another children's game we have.

If you are off on the time by 30 seconds when doing celestial navigation, your line of position will be off by more than a 100 miles.  I called Casio technical support to inquire and they said that it should not be running that fast and to send the watch to them at my expense, which I did.  They returned the watch to me, not repaired, with a note saying that their watches were only designed to run plus or minus 3 minutes per year, which is significantly less accurate than other less expensive digital and quartz watches I have owned have kept time.  Casio's exact comments were: ""For your complaint 'watch running fast 3 minutes per year', we have tested the operation of your watch carefully.  We are glad to be able to assure you that your timepiece is operating according to factory specification.  All timekeeping functions meet specification, and the timing accuracy of your watch is within the user guide specification of plus or minus 15 seconds per month (this extends to +/- 180 seconds, or 3 minutes, per year)"".  It may have said it was this inaccurate in the user guide but, if so, I missed it.  Kind of a joke for a watch called ""Sea Pathfinder Tide Watch!""As far as the other watch function go, it will give you tides if you do enough homework to input local stellar information.  Compass will give general heading if held steady enough.  Temperature must be done after removing the watch from your wrist long enough for it not to be influenced by your body temperature.

I have owned and used steamers for several years and recently compared this steamer with two other popular steamers both made in China and available on the mass market...the Shark Euro-Pro Steam Blaster Ultra and the SteamFast 275 available from online merchants and warehouse clubs.  I purchased the Piccolo to replace my older Delonghi Steam Clean Plus.  Note: if your water has any hardness at all, you will greatly extend the life of your steamer by using distilled water and occassionally descaling with a descaling solution (available from Saeco coffee dealers).First the Piccolo is smaller than I would have thought, especially considering its considerable power.  My first one's handle was broken and returned to the online merchant to get a new one.  I did the tests I will describe later with both my returned Piccolo and the new one.  The performance was consistent.  Those black/grey circles on the side are not wheels as you might expect from the marketing photo.  They are just decoration...the unit has very small plastic wheels on the bottom of the unit...but it is so small it's quite easy to just carry it around and set it down on the floor where you want to use it.The unit heats up from a full tank in about 7 minutes.  The tank is stainless steel and the temperature I recorded at the tip is about 190 degrees F.  The steam pressure is adjustable from how tightly you squeeze the trigger.  The unit has a light to indicate boiler heating and one to show you the tank is empty (other sub $200 sometimes skip this indicator light...although pretty obvious when you run out of water).The steam pressure of the Piccolo is impressive, particularly when compared with the other units referenced.  The performance improvement of the Piccolo over the Chinese made steamers is not even remotely close.  I would rate the quality of the accessories from the different manufacturers evenly...I may even give a slight nod to the Shark and SteamFast for the quality and quantity of accessories, particularly if used primarily for clothes steaming.For my first ""Experiment,"" I compared temperatures as refernced above.  The Piccolo won here by a small margin. Secondly I put a paper cup on the floor and with both machines heated up with a full tank of water, I pointed the nozzle at the opening of the cup to see which model would blow the cup the farthest.  The SteamFast product blew the cup about five feet.  The Piccolo blew the cup 15 feet and probably would have kept going if it was not for the wall stopping it.  Not even remotely close.Next I took both steamers (the Piccolo and the SteamFast) out on my deck and pointed the nozzles at a hose that ""overwintered"" on my deck....complete with black moldy stains hiding the normally greeen hose.  The SteamFast product blew steam at the hose but it did not really eliminate the moldy stains, despite holding the tip on the hose at point o range for many seconds.Next tried the Piccolo...WOW....this sucker blasted those stains down to fresh green hose, like instantly!So all in all, I am very impressed with the steam pressure of this unit.  While you can get more bells and whistles from the Shark and the SteamFast, you won't have the copious steam pressure of the piccolo.  This is a big deal.Trust me, if you are cleaning gunk, grease, grout, moldy stains, plastic children't furniture (makes those little tikes/step 2 heavy thick plastic like new), glass, tile/hard floors, etc. the piccolo runs right over the competition.Downsides: No product is perfect and as much as I love my piccolo be aware the hose can get hot and if the unit sits a few minutes in between uses.....and you pull the trigger, you'll get a nice blast of 200 degree water coming out...be very careful around children...this thing can scald and can send a blast of very hot water fifteen feet.  This is not a deficiency of the product...all steamers do this to a certain extent.....just like when you make steamed milk for a latte from an espresso machine...the first blast will be hot water and steam and barristas will press the steam lever for a few seconds to ""blow"" out the hot water before turning off and putting the milk in to get a ""dryer"" steam.  So when you take a break, point the nozzle at a sink or away from people for a few seconds to discharge the hot water.  My guess is that the water coming out after a break is vapor that has condensed in the hose during the break.  Since the Piccolo has such great pressure, it acts like a momentary hot water ""Super-Blaster"" upon re-activation of steam production.  Just be careful.  This is not a toy.When you run out of water you may have to wait 15 minutes until the steam pressure comes down enough to safety remove the tank cap...don't rush this or if you do a little bit....use a towel to undo the cap, lest you want a steam facial with sputtering scalding water possible if the tank was not completely dry.The last potential negative is that it is not clear to me whether Saeco will be continuing to produce/service this model in the US for the long haul.....I hope they do since it is by far the best steamer among the four I have owned tested.I love my saeco and would not hesitate ordering one for every adult member of my family...particularly if I could still locate them for under $60.  Still the best steamer I have found under $200 bar none.

It picks up little ambient noise and transmits voice clearly.The major, major problem is with the left ear.  Maybe I got a defective one, but the sound coming out of left ear is not much better than a mosquito buzzing by.  The most accurate analogy here would be that it feels like you're listening to something underwater.

These type of stickers are probably for the kid at heart in all of us.  They aren&#8217;t really expensive, but have that delightful charm and a little bit of bling my iPad needs.  My problem was trying to decide which sticker I was going to dress it up with.  I finally settled on the marble-like swirled design and put it on my home button.  When removing the stickers from their paper storage holder, simply slip the tip of your fingernail beneath one edge and pull lightly. The easiest way to position the sticker is to lick your pointer finger to get it into the position you want, carefully apply, and press it down.If you miss and get it into a position you don&#8217;t like, simply pull the sticker off and start again.  Some people are actually collecting these reusable stickers to personalize their iOS devices.  The Toddy home button stickers are quite functional in one regard.  If you are trying to find your home button in a darkened room, the colored buttons make it quite easy to spot and feel.  The sticker I selected adds a bit of charm to my iPad and when I get tired of it, I can easily swap it out for a different design.The nice thing about these home button stickers is that they are made out of a very durable feeling material.  As I mentioned before, they are reusable, a factor to keep in mind if you are counting your pennies.  They are also lightweight and scratch-resistant (I tried).  The black and white flower design home button is a complimentary color for iOS devices, but jazzing them up with this assortment now makes them look less drab.  Necessary?

After only a year I have rescinded this idea and come to distrust anything made by the Kenneth Cole brand.  Where you might think this is a tad overzealous, let me give full disclosure that I love the KC style but I think they need to seriously improve their durability - but let me focus on this particular purchase...  The leather is a poor form of 'genuine leather' where the black side is merely painted over the processed brown inner.  Genuine leather, for those not familiar with the leather grading process, is the lowest form of solid leather... the form lower would be pulp leather (similar to composite board, if you know your woods).  So I've noticed that, while wearing the black side out, the buckle rubs the black paint off.  I was hoping KC would at least properly stain their belts but no...  What you get is a belt that will look snazzy for about 3 months of daily use and then become checkered and patchy like the crappy product it is.

When you sharpen this thing it is SHARP, I have accidental jab wounds on my fingers that will attest to this. My one major qualm is that the edge on this knife is so thin that the length of the knife sometimes will flex on a plastic cutting board when you are working too quickly and that can be a disconcerting feeling. Also keep in mind that this is a thin piece of metal wrapped in plastic and resin. The first day I had this knife, I bumped it on the counter and it spun handle-first close to the gas flame on the stove and it did start to melt. But that was my fault. Of more concern in terms of durability is the fact that the resin coating has started chipping away in maybe one or two milimeter spots on the knife's sharp edge. I was wondering how the coating would wear away as you sharpened the blade over the years; four or five months into owning the knife, here is my answer. However, I don't regret this purchase, this is a very sharp and efficient knife; if nothing else it has alerted me to the utility of the Santoku knife in general and maybe I'll now invest in a serious Santoku, one that will last 10 years or more, because I expect this knife to be toasted in a couple of years or less.

You don&#8217;t need this expansion to enjoy the original. If you like the original game and are still excited to play it, I would just stick with that. On the other hand, if you don&#8217;t like the original, I don&#8217;t think this expansion will make it better for you. The purpose of the expansion, as I see it, is to add a bit more variety and difficulty to the base game once you start to feel like you&#8217;ve played it out.In our case, that came after 30-something plays. We could consistently win both sides of the board at the Heroic level, and had started trying to increase the difficulty by adding an extra initial explosion, which tended to end badly. We wanted a bit more variety and a bit more challenge, which is where Urban Structures comes in.At that point, I think Urban Structures is a decent investment. It comes with a new character and a two-sided board, so you&#8217;re getting a good amount of content for a reasonable price. Since these three additions (the character and the two boards) can be used independently, I&#8217;ll basically write three separate reviews of these three parts.New Character: The Structural EngineerIn some ways, this new character makes the most dramatic difference to the game. He has the ability to remove hotspots and repair damage, which means that you can approach the fire in a completely different way: there&#8217;s a possibility of actually overcoming it, rather than just delaying the inevitable long enough to snatch the people out. We played one game in the Brownstone where we actually put out all the fire and removed all the hotspots. It seems unlikely for this to occur at the Heroic level on the more challenging High Rise board, but just the possibility of eliminating hot spots and damage means that you can look at the game differently, and you have more options to consider at any given point. For me at least, more options means more fun. The Structural Engineer is a powerful character, but he also has a serious weakness: he can&#8217;t put out smoke or fire at all. This means that there&#8217;s always a lot of tension surrounding the decision to bring him out: as long as things keep going well, he can make a lot of progress, but a few bad rolls can render him almost useless. I&#8217;m definitely happy to have him around.On the other hand, I&#8217;m really glad that he came as part of an expansion that includes boards as well, because I would have had trouble justifying the expense of an individual card if he were priced anything like the Rescue Dog/Veteran package. Fortunately, the boards add welcome variety too.New Board: The BrownstoneThis board isn&#8217;t dramatically different from the original boards, but it adds enough of a twist to make it worth owning. The basic idea is that it&#8217;s part of an apartment block, so you can enter only from the front or the back, and it takes longer to drive from one side to the other. This definitely makes it a bit more challenging than the basic boards, but not dramatically so. We played our first game on Veteran, and won pretty easily, rescuing all 10 victims. After that we moved on to Heroic, and it took three attempts to win. Our eighth play at the Heroic level (our ninth overall on this board) was when we managed to save all ten victims and also put out the fire completely. After one more play, we moved on to the other new board.Of course, there&#8217;s a huge element of luck here, so that the number of attempts it takes to win at different difficulty levels doesn&#8217;t correspond to some measure of absolute difficulty. My main point here was just to give some indication of replayability. For us personally, it took 10 plays before we were ready to move on. That&#8217;s a decent amount, considering that this is only one of two boards included in the expansion, and we&#8217;d probably be happy to play more if we didn&#8217;t have other tempting expansion options waiting. The Brownstone certainly still feels fresher than the two original boards. But given that we played 37 times on the original boards&#8212;so, about 20 on each&#8212;before buying any expansions, I&#8217;d say that it doesn&#8217;t add quite as much novelty as I might have hoped for.New Board: the High RiseThis is the one part of the expansion that disappointed me a bit, for several reasons. Basically, I feel like it sacrificed a lot of the intuitiveness of the base game without very good reason. There are a bunch of new rules, and they aren&#8217;t always explained clearly: after reading through the rulebook, I immediately read all the relevant BGG threads that I could find, and still wasn&#8217;t 100% sure about how to chop into this building from the outside.Since this is a High Rise, you can only get into the building via the elevators in the centre or by using the ladder on the fire truck, and to get in using the ladder there has to be a hole in the wall. Moving into the building from the fire truck costs two movement points, representing the need to climb the ladder as well. But how do you combine climbing and chopping? The verdict seems to be that you chop external walls just by walking along the street outside, and then return to the fire truck when you actually want to go up and in. This is thematically awkward, to say the least. I try to pretend that it actually represents climbing along the arm of the fire truck to chop, but it still doesn&#8217;t quite make sense. At least we don&#8217;t have to do this too often.Even worse is the introduction of &#8220;light walls&#8221; surrounding cubicles in the workplace. There are a lot of these light walls, which were apparently introduced just to make the game harder. Thematically, they make no sense. The cubicles have no doors, so you have to chop through to get at any fire or POI inside, and an explosion surrounded on all sides by walls will do a lot of damage. Basically, the cubicles increase the difficulty level by running through the damage counters more quickly. The problem is that buildings don&#8217;t actually work this way. Flimsy cubicle walls do not provide structural support, and you could tear them all down without making the building collapse. I appreciate the need to make the game more challenging, but I don&#8217;t think it should have come at the cost of the natural and intuitive feeling that made the original Flash Point so immersive and fun to play. I like games where the theme makes sense and the rules are guided by logic, but some of that has been sacrificed here.That said, I still enjoy playing the High Rise map despite the grumpiness caused by the artificial-feeling rules. As long as the major action isn&#8217;t taking place in the cubicles, I&#8217;m perfectly happy. And the fact that this map is a lot harder than the others is definitely a major advantage. There&#8217;s no longer a sense that we can just choose an ideal firefighting team before we&#8217;ve even looked at the fire, because there&#8217;s really no margin for error on this board. It took us eight plays before we could win on the Heroic level, and I still wouldn&#8217;t say we&#8217;ve come close to mastering it; we just got pretty lucky with the hotspot rolls. This means that this board should continue to provide a welcome challenge for many plays to come.Final ThoughtsThis isn&#8217;t a perfect expansion by any means, but it serves its purpose. I wish we could have had more challenge and variety without sacrificing the logical and intuitive ruleset, but I&#8217;m still satisfied with the purchase. I&#8217;ve played it 18 times so far, and I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m done with it yet, since the High Rise board continues to present a challenge. At the same time, I&#8217;m looking forward to trying some of the other expansions, and I hope that they can manage to provide a challenging experience without distancing themselves so much from reality. If they turn out to meet our needs better, then Urban Structures may not get so many more plays after all&#8212;but I&#8217;ll still be happy to have the Structural Engineer.",4.0,"More variety and challenge, at the cost of logic and intuitiveness",1394409600,"03 10, 2014",Toys_and_Games,"{'CS': 0.889703446, 'MNR': 0.0, 'RB': 0.0, 'RC': 9.0, 'PR': 77.77777778, 'NR': 22.22222222, 'FR': 0.0, 'RSP': 0.0, 'AW': 1166.0, 'RD': 0.777777778, 'RL': 8151.0, 'ER': 0.0, 'PC': 1.167140506}",0.0

(If your system uses common DDR memory, STOP here, and look elsewhere, this won't help you...)My P4 had only 256 KB of RDRAM, and thus, running Windows XP, it was booting slow, and applications were also slow due to excesive Hard disk page (swap) file use. XP's performance monitors showed that RAM usage was at 98% almost all of the time, even with no open programs!!! And the Hard Disk activity was almost non-stop.I am not using this system for the latest and greatest gaming or other such demanding applications like photoshop, and so I don't need the latest hardware. XP's performance monitor showed CPU usage was less than 50% most of the time, so the CPU was doing fine.I thought that, since RDRAM never really caught on, nobody else would bother trying to find it to update this system. Also, most of the few RDRAM still for sale is very expensive.I could have just replaced the whole computer with a new one, but I felt that doing that, this system would have ended in the trash, which would be a shame since it's perfectly good. (Wouldn't help the environment either).And so, I searched long and hard for RDRAM and settled for the one for sale at Amazon: It suited my system perfectly and was reasonably priced.I must state that the seller I bought it from is RDRAM4SALE. They were clear that their product was Samsung instead of the Simpletech pictured, which was fine with me: I trust the Samsung brand.(E-mail RDRAM4SALE first: they helped me to choose the right RDRAM for my system).Be aware that not all RDRAM for sale on the web might be suitable for your system!!! You need to know your motherboard brand, chipset, speed, processor FSB...Also, if your system operates in dual channel mode, you MUST buy and install RDRAM in PAIRS. Otherwise, system won't work.Mine does, and so I bought 2 RIMMS of 256 MB each, which added to the already installed 2 x 128 MB RIMMS, gives me now 768 MB of RAM.Was it worth it? You bet!For about $42.89, my system is at least twice as fast!!! (Checked with a clock).XP's performance monitor shows RAM usage at about 65%, which is good enough. It takes a lot of open programs and open windows to see usage at the previous 98%.I am glad I decided to keep this computer. It feels better than many current PC's with dual/quad core processors. It does what I need, and avoided that it would have ended in some one's trash.Had I built a new computer, I would have avoided buying components in-route to obsolecense, and would had spent almost $1000.Since it performs so well, I'm sure I will be able to use it for a long time.

This case has performed flawlessly both in and out of the river, I'vebeen tossed through rapids, fell out of my boat and been hit by rocks and rapids and this case has protected my phone through it all! (i keep my phone  in a little pocket on my lifejacket).  I've even dropped my phone in a pool after going off a waterslide.  I am not so sure as to why so many people are having problems with this case.  I ordered this case because my one of my friends had it, and he said that there was no problem when his 11 month old daughter dropped his phone into the bathtub.  That was enough convincing for me, also the price is not anywhere near the price of some other cases.  So after having this case for a few months, ill go over the pros and cons.PROS:LightweightDoesn't bulk up the phone too much as some other cases.. *cough otterbox cough* doDurable plastic shell has been dropped many times from many heights.The water test was fine, and my real experience using it in water has been flawlessThe case looks sleek, and doesn't make your phone look gaudy and overdone.You can use it in the shower!The buttons are not depressed by the pressure of the case on the phone itself.CONS:The charging port did not fit my charger exactly, but this was easily fixed by taking a file to the head of it and now it works! (you can always get another cable!)The case is VERY snug and can be difficult to put on.Cannot use your old screen protectorOVERALL:Although there are some very bad reviews of this case, I will have to just say that the reason that people had these problems (ie leakage and breakage) is probably because of user error in testing the limits of the case, and/or assembly of the case.  My advice is to clean your phone THOROUGHLY before applying the case because there is a little rubber seal that goes around the top part of the case, and if obstructed by your old screen protector it will not work!  Also, make sure that the case is snapped on completely before use! Hopefully some people will notice that this case is a bargain at this price, and will work if you use it correctly!

The opening is so small that every time you refill it, the water spills over and then gets trapped between the bottle and the silicone cover.

Schuster ""bodysurfing webmaster""","[0.0, 0.0]","Ok, so maybe I should have been more skeptical of such a low price case and such rave reviews.  I should have paid more attention to the negative reviews that seem to be quite consistent.  The lack of a truly grippy rubber surface is disappointing.  Especially since this feature, i.e. not sliding off of a smooth surface, is one of the main reasons I selected this case model.  Well the rubber is not only less grippy and thin than I'd like, the back of the case is arched in a slight but noticeable ^ that means the most of the surface area that contacts is actually slick and smooth, thereby negating the traction altogether.  Even worse is the distortion from the flash while taking photos.  The shot is completely hazed.  What idiot designed this?  Who needs a case that must be removed every time you want to take a flash shot. And its not easy to remove at that.  I have made dozens of purchases via Amazon but this was by far my most disappointing. For five bucks I can't gripe too much more.  Maybe it will work for you but back to the $25 Speck hard/soft case next time.

I haven't had a chance to replace it yet, but last night, my thumb brushed past the chipped corner and a shard of glass punctured my skin.  Ouch.  If your screen cracks on the edges, BE CAREFUL!  There was no film to protect me from the shards of glass, even though the descriptions mentions this.These glass protectors are almost commodity items, and the generic ones are pretty much the same. The 'brand' name ones that cost 3-5 times this one seem a little bit clearer/whiter. This one had a faint green tint when compared to the expensive one lying on white paper. In any case, I would have been fine, but just a week after installation, the corner chipped. I've never dropped it or put it in a pocket with anything else. I discovered the chip right after I removed the plastic case. Even tho it'a a generic priced protector, I'm disappointed it cracked so fast under a pampered environment.  A magnified look at the edge doesn't show a dramatically beveled edge.  It's possible that all tempered glass protectors are more hype than anything else.",1.0,Chipped corner in one week.
