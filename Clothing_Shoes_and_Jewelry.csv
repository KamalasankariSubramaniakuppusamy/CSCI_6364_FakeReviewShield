She's no pixy, but she's not huge either, and it was VERY tight on her, so I doubt a 6 year old can fit it comfortably.  The tutu fell apart after 12 hours -- the satin waistband detached from the tulle.  Unless twirling counts as rough wear, I'd say this was poorly constructed.  I sent two messages to Sydney So Sweet directly, trying to get a replacement or at least some kind of acknowledgement and NOTHING.  So ... crappy construction and crappy customer service.  I already don't like tutu/fairy/princess stuff, and this just furthers my opinion that companies like this are preying on daughters.

Her playdates, two who are closer to 3, are madly in love with the tutus--it's a good thing we only have one of them at a time. I think that it would ideally fit a 3 or 4 year old without any stretch, but could fit kids possibly up to the age of twelve with the amount of stretch it has. The elastic has very nice give and the layers of tulle are very nicely proportioned and soft. After throwing it in the wash, the edges can curl a little with minimal fray--maybe I could have put it on a gentler cycle, but it looks pretty much lithe same. I really like the way the elastic is sewn in. The satin edge is part of the tulle fabric, not sewn on, and the elastic is enclosed between the layers of the satin edge, making it seem pretty secure.

The handle makes it very convenient to pick up and carry to the dressing table or bed. All closed up, it's just as cute as can be. I'm very pleased with the overall looks of it. I've never had hanging storage for my necklaces before, and I do like this feature. The only fault I find is with the earring storage area that has plastic inserts. Nine holes per insert, which means I'd have to separate one pair. Having to attach the earrings through the holes is bothersome, too, and the plastic is just ugly. I'd much rather just have the little divided spaces to drop the earrings into.  I've removed the inserts (they just slide up and out) and am using the space for something else.I'm not sure how useful the little travel box will be, but it's cute, and it's kind of neat that it will fit right into the box or can be left out and that space used to store something else. I was a bit shocked when I started looking at jewelry storage prices, and I believe this item gives a lot of good storage for the money.

This jewelry box also has a mirror under the lid and the whole case folds up and locks securely! I love it!  Before I bought this, I had kept my jewelry in an assortment of little ceramic boxes that cluttered up my dresser.  Now, all is consolidated into a single, attractive case that fits nicely on my dresser. I am very satisfied with my choice.  I might add that I looked at almost every jewelry case that Amazon offered and I kept coming back to this one. The price was right and the product is wonderful.  Don't be misled by the color in the pictures.

I had to find out by checking my bank account, and even then, they only refunded $10 of the return freight when it was nearly $30 to ship back!So, when I went back to REPLACE the case, as I originally requested, they said SURE!  BUT ...  it will cost you more!

I'll preface this by saying that I was a public school teacher for many years, grew up with languages and spend every day, now, working with Iraqi refugees.  This might sound like the perfect situation to purchase Arabic by Rosetta Stone? Not so.  First of all, the headset/microphone was of poor quality and only picks up my words now and then. It's difficult to score well when the program thinks you are not speaking. Secondly, one should understand that there is not one word of English with this product nor did I receive any instructions on how to use it. It became trial and error. Thirdly, I was unaware that the dialects in Arabic are so numerous that Rosetta stone was not terribly useful when speaking with Iraqis.  This is, by no means, the fault of Rosetta Stone but I wish I knew this before my purchase. Lastly, so many of the lessons used phrases that were of no use to me in the real world in which I work. Again, Rosetta Stone would not have any idea which phrases to teach and which phrases to use but I have, yet, no need to be able to talk about a group of men who might be running or a woman eating an apple.

Rech,"[112, 113]","Many people complain about no English translations on the screen when you hear new words and phrases.It's important to realize that when using Rosetta Stone, you are not supposed to completely understand the words/phrases when you hear them the first time, or even the second or third.  You're not supposed to know the answers before the software asks you to interact.  Rosetta Stone forces your mind to grasp at possible meanings until you puzzle it out, and when you do finally puzzle it out, a light bulb flashes on and true comprehension takes place.Rosetta Stone integrates failure and 'learning by trial and error' directly into the program which, for me, makes the vocabulary and usage far more concrete in my head than being told what something means then picking it out of a list.  What good does that do?If you pay attention to the pictures and the context in which they are displayed, you really can intuit the meanings of the words and phrases.  After you fail to choose the correct answers then finally get it right, this stuff will be burned into your memory because you've been actively engaged in the 'discovery of the language.  Exactly like a kid does.  Exactly what Rosetta Stone claims.To summarize: you can't sit there and passively learn the language.  Rosetta Stone won't download it into your brain.

I really would not recommend Rosetta Stone products for non-European languages for several reasons, but I focus on the Arabic here (and I assume the learner is a native English speaker):-The type of Arabic this teaches you is called Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) or Fusha. This is the ""higher register"" of Arabic which is used in formal settings by the educated class: the news, academics, some clerics, most literature. Generally, Arabic speakers use a local dialect of Arabic, which is very, very different from this version of the language. For instance: imagine reading a work of Medieval ""Middle"" English. The language would be mostly quasi-familiar English words, but most of the usage, pronunciation, and grammar would seem tricky, overly complex, or old-fashioned. You would be able to understand some of it, but would miss a bit, too. ""The sky is blue"" would be like ""de heofon ist hewn bleu."" MSA is like that to 90% of Arabic speakers: not totally gibberish, but not approachable either. Don't misunderstand me though, all Arabic learners should learn MSA, but know that you won't be speaking it much.-The reverse is also a problem. You can speak all the MSA you want (from Rosetta Stone or elsewhere) but almost no one will speak it back to you, and some people will literally laugh in your face for speaking that way. None of the living dialects of Arabic are that close to MSA, so even if you memorized every word of Rosetta Stone Arabic, you would not be able to understand almost anyone who didn't go to university.-To make matters even weirder, Rosetta Stone Arabic included the highly complicated case endings (called Iraab) on all the words. That is to say, there are certain changes to the last vowels of most words in the most formal of formal Arabic literature, like the Qur'an, the Bible, and poetry. These case endings mark what part of speech is being used, so for example ""kitaab"" is ""book,"" ""kitaabun"" is ""book"" if it is the subject of the sentence, ""kitaabi"" is ""book"" if it is direct object, ""kitaaba"" is ""book"" if it is in a prepositional phrase, etc. It is very complex and NO ONE EVER, EVER SPEAKS THAT WAY, even in MSA. Iraab use is technically correct, but even native speakers get confused by it (and rightly so). Not only does it not reflect any normal Arabic speech, because Rosetta Stone does not explain any grammar directly, I seriously doubt anyone would be able to sort out the meanings of the case endings just from context. This one was a major blunder that is mind-boggling for such an expensive product.-More on the grammar bit: it is great that Rosetta Stone wants to avoid speaking English, but Arabic grammar is not intuitive for English speakers. Therefore, unless you already have a fair bit of Arabic grammar, you will be completely confused. For example, in Arabic there is a system of root letters that make up most words. The pattern of these roots changes depending on meaning, so if a book is ""green"" it is ""akhdar,"" but if a car is ""green"" it is ""khadr'."" Unless you already know that Arabic has a masculine/feminine gender system, and a root for greeness based on the letters kh-d-r, you would not be able to deduce what was happening (I really, really doubt it anyway.) Arabic has lots of grammar that throws English speakers for a loop and needs to be explained directly and in detail: there are tons of ways to pluralize, a ""dual"" case between singular and plural, a very different sentence structure, and on and on.-There is no cultural context provided, which is really strange. Why would I need to know the word for ""sandwich"" in the formal register of Arabic? Why does it teach how to say someone is ""Russian"" or ""Japanese"" and not how to say they are ""Jordanian,"" ""Saudi Arabian,"" or ""Moroccan""?I could only imagine two reasons someone would find Rosetta Stone Arabic useful:1. If they already spoke some Arabic and wanted a refresher course in the more formal parts of the language, which I guess could happen.2. They wanted to focus specifically on Arabic literature of some sort and already had some familiarity with Arabic grammar and syntax.Do not buy this product if:1. You want to learn Arabic from scratch on your own. You will learn nothing at all, I swear.2. You are traveling to the Arab world and want some basic speaking skills.3. You want to learn about Arab culture or the language's use and history.I didn't intend to rant but this is a very expensive product and it really is not worth the cd its copied on.

Much depends on the student, their goals, and their self-discipline. Dealing with a tonal language or a language with a different script, the student need make some big decisions about how they want to learn, and how much. Relatively speaking, Filipino/Pilipino/Tagalog is easy.I learned Spanish as an adult. I am now fluent at a professional/business level. About 10-15% of Tagalog is Spanish, and the spelling of Tagalog words are all based on Spanish sounds.I learned to read Thai. I can write some, but my vocabulary is very small. 90% of my Thai came from taking private one-on-one classes while living in Thailand for 6 months.I studied some Tagalog, some Korean, and some Thai using Rosetta Stone.If you just want to learn some Tagalog to get around as a tourist, enough people speak excellent English in the Philippines you will probably never be able to use it. The Filipinos who don't speak English will typically avoid speaking to you, even when you try to speak Tagalog. Regardless, an immersion product, like Rosetta Stone, is probably not as useful because much of the vocabulary and context is not related to what you will want to know (do you really need to say the boy is under the soccer ball?).If you want to seriously learn the language to be able to carry on casual or business conversations, commit early and realize there is far more work involved. To really practice Tagalog, you will need to go to less savory parts of Manila, or plan on getting outside of Manila, Cebu, away from the red light districts in Olongapo and Angeles, and avoid the resort areas like Puerta Galera and Boracay. To really use Tagalog, you need to go to areas where those who don't speak English are willing to make an effort to understand you.For me, I first needed to learn the alphabet. Since spelling is based on Spanish phonetics and the Roman alphabet, this was easy for me with Tagalog. For other languages, like Thai, you CANNOT consistently pronounce Thai correctly using Romanized phonetics. T one rules are only consistent in Thai script.  Among other challenges, the Romanization is wildly inconsistent. You learn it one way, and then another source using different phonetics mires you in confusion. The same is probably also true of Korean, as it is also a phonetic language. Learning Chinese will likely be different. This part of Tagalog is easy though.Second, I realized for me, I need to take notes. As adults we want to take notes to help remember key points. If you take the notes in English, you are handicapping yourself. This is more difficult, and far more important, in languages with their own script.Third, again for me, I knew learning translation would create a permanent handicap. Early on, translation is easier, later on translation must be unlearned as it stilts actual conversation and thinking. You just can't translate fast enough. Even now, being fluent in Spanish, translating gives me a headache and frustrates me. I either have a conversation in Spanish, thinking in Spanish, or I have a conversation in English thinking in English. If I know a word in one language and not the other, my whole train of thought is derailed. Avoiding learning translation is where Rosetta Stone shines.I like the idea of Rosetta Stone. If you are disciplined and do the lessons, you will expand your spoken vocabulary rapidly. You will remember what you learn. For reading and writing, Rosetta Stone is limited. I doubt it will do much for reading and writing with non-Roman scripts. Like any learning tool, disciplined study will yield results.Rosetta Stone is very expensive. Competing products like L-Lingo or products using different methods like Pimsleur, TellMeMore.com, Assimil, or Fluenz (supposedly the best, but only in a few languages) are a fraction of the cost of Rosetta Stone. Many of the different methods will work better for some people than others. Assimil is translation based. Pimsleur is hard to describe, but has a very good fluency success rate (supposedly). Look up Fluenz also, as the method and reviews suggest it is very effective in the few languages they offer.Besides cost, what is the other drawback to Rosetta Stone?The drawbacks are legion.Version 2 is good. Version 2 is how Rosetta Stone grew into a powerhouse. The voice recognition is very primitive. Version 3 is a refinement of version 2 with improved continuity, a smoother interface, better quizzes, and the ability to get rid of the stupid ""must have CD with you at all times"" limitation. You can also advance or return to the exact spot where you left off earlier.Unfortunately, Rosetta Stone dropped support for Version 2. Even though they were selling version 2 from their own website in 2012, they dropped support. Mac users are especially impacted as Mac OSX Lion will no longer run PPC apps, and Rosetta Stone never ported Version 2 to Intel. So, if you bought Version 2 in 2012 to use on a Mac, you were ripped off by Rosetta Stone. Join the crowd.Windows users should not be too smug about the situation, as the end of Version 2 support means your product will have all sorts of issues too, unless you downgrade to WinXP.Version 3 does run on current platforms, and is at least somewhat supported (to the extent Rosetta Stone supports any product). Version 3 is easily the pinnacle of Rosetta Stone software. Given so many users prefer version 3 to version 4 though, don't be surprised if they pull a Microsoft and force you to their new product nobody wants.Total 4e, is a retrograde of Rosetta Stone. To be fair, if you are always connected -- literally 100% of the time, never a lost packet -- and live your life via social media, Total 4e might be effective. Don't expect to use the highly touted iOS apps on your iPhone or iPad though unless you are connected 100% of the time with those devices also. The whole idea of quickly practicing while in line or waiting in an office...yeah, that doesn't conform to the Rosetta Stone licensing model.Speaking of which, Rosetta Stone now has two components and two licensing models. There is the software application and the online social media part. The application can be run as long as they support it on current platforms. The online social media component is now on a subscription basis. You pay for every month in which you want to participate. You can still use the app on your computer, but you just paid a premium for online access you aren't using unless you continue to pay the subscription.Given there are many free or lower cost websites where learners can interact and practice language skills, why pay Rosetta Stone a monthly premium for less content? Therein lies the reason so many people look at Total 4e and then try to find version 3 before supplies run out.How about another suggestion?Try L-Lingo. L-Lingo uses a very similar learning model to Rosetta Stone. The interface actually has more features than Rosetta Stone and you can customize the interface to use Roman phonetics or native script. They have iPad and iPhone/IPod Touch iOS apps which you can use on a plane, or anywhere else, with or without Internet access. Best of all, all of their programs together (Win or Mac desktop, iPad, iPhone/iPod Touch) are less than half the cost of Rosetta Stone Level I.L-Lingo specializes in Asian languages. They are probably a superior option to Rosetta Stone Total 4e for most users. L-Lingo offers a free trial for their desktop application, and also for their iOS applicastions for some languages.There are other good options listed above, particularly Fluenz and Pimsleur which use different methods.

That way you know if you are able to learn from the software, before investing even more money into it. Since total immersion into another country to learn is not always an option, Rosetta Stone it the next best thing. While a class environment might work better for some, there's not always time for that either. Sometimes there's just enough time on the weekends, or in the evenings after work to get a few hours of studying in. Or maybe you just don't want to sit in a school like classroom, trying to learn from an instructor. That's where Rosetta Stone comes in.Rosetta Stone tries to be more than just a computer program. Instead it's interactive, and is a cross between software and an at-home classroom Spanish lesson. The software comes with a headset and microphone so that while you are learning, you also speak into the headset and respond to questions. The software helps one learn how to pronounce the words and practice what you've learned to help retain it. Unlike a classroom environment, you can work at this at your own pace, which I appreciate. When I took a Spanish class, some of the students flew ahead of me, while the rest of us were just trying to keep up. Rosetta Stone lets a person learn at the pace they learn at (fast or slow) so they don't end up missing anything along the way. I'm more comfortable learning from the program as well, than in front of a group of strangers .While going to France and living there for a while is probably the easiest and fastest way to learn French, Rosetta Stone is the next best thing, and a more realistic option for most people.",5.0,"Suggest getting this 1 level at a time, so you know if you can learn from the program",1365465600,"04 9, 2013",Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,1.0

LOL.So I got this and installed it and tried it out. One key thing that you need to remember is that unless you actually sit there and speak the words then it's not going to do you nearly as much good as it could. Participate in it fully and you'll get much farther than you think you would.Now there are a lot of different language learning softwares on the market but rosetta stone seems to be a very well respected one and from what I've experienced they kind of deserve the respect. Would I like it somethings were different...? Of course, I would like the world to bend to my will... LOL. But none the less it's a great bit of software, well more like a lot of software.Some Pros:Unlike a lot of generic software RS makes it a point to associate words with concepts and ideas while other programs just give you a translation, this helps with the learning process greatly.Vocabulary, without a big vocabulary it's going to be hard to understand what's being said and how to respond. RS teaches you a large variety or words to help with understanding.Cons:I really disliked the lack of language structure given in terms of grammatical uses of the words for spoken language, as in how to speak properly. In this beginners level it seems to concentrate mainly on just teaching you the words instead of giving you a combination of words and how to implement them properly. Granted this is Level 1 but it would have been much nicer if there was a lot more sentence structure given versus just the vocabulary and small hints at structure.All in all it's helpful as I can now make out what my relatives are now saying when I speak to them on skype or other means, which is great but I still have a lot to learn to really speak the language.My other issue with the software is the price.... I find it pretty over priced for what you get in just one level of the software. I haven't tried a whole lot of the other systems out there but I do know a few who have and those who have have all commented that this software is overpriced for what you get compared to other systems out there.

The learning system is very immersive and might seem daunting at first, but they do such a great job of breaking into down into very simple pieces that if you just ""go with it"" you'll find it really works.

I've taken Spanish before, but that was almost 10 years ago, and the only other language (besides English) I became proficient at was Hmong, which I learned through a religious text in Hmong and in English, some flash cards and a dictionary that was Hmong to English, in addition to spending time around native speakers daily.I don't believe there is a perfect way to learn a language, and our minds are far different than they were when we were children. Rosetta Stone does seem to be effective, though. I remember almost everything I've learned, and the grammar starts to identify itself as you work through it. I wouldn't go in with the mindset that everything is exactly as it seems; French, like Spanish, has verb tenses, and they all sound similar (moreso than Spanish), but if you watch for them, they become clear. Rosetta Stone makes you work a bit harder for the grammar, but the vocabulary comes pretty easily. I don't believe language learning is easy; it's hard to learn how to say the words, how to use them, and for me, hard to hear them coming from the mouths of natives. Rosetta Stone does a good job because it uses native speakers of both genders to say the words. I think it has its flaws, like how finicky the audio recognition can be, and I find the lessons can get boring because they get a bit repetitive, but I think that is a personal thing.Also, I think it's a great tool for people trying to learn a language who don't have much educational background. Sometimes I would work with old Hmong women, and while they struggled with using the English Rosetta Stone, they would have struggled far more sitting in a class with me trying to teach them through translation, since most of them couldn't read Hmong anyway.I see it as a useful tool, and a unique one amongst the more normal solutions. I still recommend some reading and writing and grammar study, but a lot of that manifests itself in Rosetta Stone if you aren't too lazy about it. Good product.

The picture-based learning approach seems awkward at first, but once you become acclimated to what it's attempting to do, you start using it almost like a super-easy memory game.  And that's where things work extraordinarily well.  A super-easy memory game...to learn a new language?  Rosetta Stone proves that it can be done.  Learning foreign plural forms, nouns, and verbs has never been quite so easy...except...The voice recognition works well, but at the same time, it's quite weird to see a word with 7 characters but you only actually make sounds for the first half of the word; granted, it can be like that because of the language...but after using Rosetta Stone, I feel like this bit of awkwardness is actually needed for any serious language learning software.  It *should* be weird at first.The biggest issues I have with the software was:1.  When you first start it up, you're kind of left thinking ""Huh?  Where are the instructions in English?  How am I supposed to match the words (text and vocal) to a picture if I obviously have no idea what they're saying.""  A short paragraph saying ""here's what you're going to do now"" would eliminate the feeling of ""did I just skip something on accident?""2.  I'm not very far through it, so it may end up fixing the grammar and syntax later, but some of the words I still don't know what they actually are.  I can get the gist of them, but the matching isn't giving me a definite answer to the words I feel I'm somewhat learning.  (ie, Are the verbs all in the infinitive?)Overall, this is the best language software (and includes audio CD for on-the-go) that I've used, but at the same time, you're really not going to buy software, use it for a couple weeks, and then know everything.  The person wanting to learn (ahem, that's you) really needs to devote themselves and their time into doing it.  From what I've done thus far (not very devoted), I feel like I could understand a book written in French that was written for a 5-6 year old.  (While that may sound like an insult, coming in knowing no French whatsoever and using this software on-and-off for a while, it's actually a big heap of praise.)Would recommend as far as what the product does.  But if you're looking for the best value (perhaps if they'd stop advertising so much, they could lower the price), this is still a great product, but after buying a few Levels, you'd likely be better off taking a class instead.

I like to understand the fundamentals of the way a language works before I just start memorizing words by looking at pictures, and Rosetta Stone doesn't teach you anything about that. You just have to figure it out. I understand the whole concept of immersion, but you need some kind of background on grammar. Five minutes about grammar at the beginning of every new chapter would solve that problem. There are rules that are very basic, like if something ends in A, in Spanish, it's probably feminine. If it ends in O, it's usually, but not always masculine. Regular verbs are conjugated the same way. I love, you love, we love. He is, she is, they are, we are, etc. But Rosetta Stone doesn't teach you anything about the language. They just keep showing you pictures of people doing stuff or eating stuff, and hope that you catch on. I took 4 years of Spanish, and have become more fluent by speaking it. But i also know the rules of the language, so I can read things I haven't seen before. I practiced French and German from cd's  and from books. I learned more from listening to cd's in my car than than Rosetta Stone. There is something to be said for teaching someone how to at least conjugate basic verbs, or explain the differences in gender in nouns. Rosetta Stone is like a video game where you just click on answers, but they don't explain why the answers are wrong or right. You can use common sense to get through the levels without learning much about the language. Then, they give you spelling tests without explaining the special characters. I can't just memorize accent marks because they popped up on the screen. Tell me when accent marks are used in general, so that I can understand when to use them. I don't know how you would ever learn to write in French, because they don't teach you how. They don't explain how to pronounce things, and French has a lot of extra syllables that are silent. They need to explain when, and why, they are silent. They expect you to copy what the people on the recording do. But, copying isn't learning a language.

I understand software piracy but between the lengthy install process, having to scratch off a 28 digit code from a little plastic card and manually enter that and the several updates I had to download it was a bit dull. I sure would have like a faster, easier program to install.

So, when Amazon Vine had it on offer, I decided to give it a try.Here's what I have to say about it after a week's exposure to my wife (aged 40+) and my daughter (age 7).Generally speaking, Rosetta Stone does a great job in exposing kids to vocabulary.  Nouns are attributed to actual pictorial representations instead of the ""x = y"" approach.  This generally works well, as we do a better job with image recognition than we do with word matching.However, that being said, this kind of representation works well when you're in the early years of school where such learning applies.  As adults, however, we have already a well-established mind set where learning doesn't equate well to a kindergarten-level.  That's typically why we, as adults, sometimes have a hard time relating simple concepts to younger children simply because we tend to use constructs that are far more complex.In other words, while pictorial representations (i.e. ""immersion"") works well to introduce new and unfamiliar words to kids, this doesn't work well when it comes to grammar.  Sentence construction is best introduced in the traditional way of learning how to conjugate ""-er"" verbs in French by establishing simple rules (which account for 65% of the verbs in the French language).  Once those rules are learned, then it's quite easy to follow.Rosetta doesn't take this approach, which is why it hurts both kids and adults for altogether different reasons.  For kids, the immersion approach doesn't work simply because the rules need to be learned by memorization which is an adult concept.  Why do kids say things like, ""I fell down and it hurtED""...?  Because they take a simple rule, apply it, and they don't realize why it doesn't work; i.e., the ""immersion"" aspect doesn't prepare them for exceptions to rules, rather than the rules themselves.  For the same reason, adults learn better from learning verb conjugation through rules, not immersion; immersion doesn't cover how to conjugate verbs through conditional tense, past imperfect, etc. and French actually has a number of rules that are easier to follow through rote memorization instead of ""here you go...now speak!""That said, this is only Level 1.  However, I would say that it's a great vocabulary primer...I just wouldn't use it to teach grammar.Maybe it works well for others, which is why I give it the benefit of 3 stars.  Children may benefit from it more because of the general learning construct, but I would have to say that it fails to convey grammar effectively.  The company has been around for awhile.  But from someone who speaks both French and English and has actually seen the difference in learning between various ages, I am somewhat dubious about their claims.

I've never taken any French classes before and wanted to try Rosetta Stone in hopes of attaining some basic language skills before an upcoming trip to Paris. At this point, I've been practicing for 45 minutes to an hour each day and am almost finished with the first unit (I think there are four or five units total in Level 1). I haven not attempted the games or live online tutoring yet, as I want to wait until I have a bit more practice under my belt.So far, I am pretty impressed with the software in general. As other reviewers have said, the style of learning is mainly picture-based, which seems to be working for me and would probably work for child learners as well. I've already learned a bunch of words and am speaking in basic sentences. For purposes of surviving a vacation to France, I think Rosetta Stone is the way to go. If I keep at this, I think I'll do pretty well asking for directions, ordering food in restaurants, and conversing with shopkeepers (there's an entire unit devoted to shopping which I haven't gotten to yet). However, people who are serious about learning the language from the ground up may be better off enrolling in an actual French language course with a real live instructor. While Rosetta Stone is teaching me basic vocabulary and sentences quickly, it doesn't explain grammar rules at all. The most confusing part for me so far is learning when to say things like ""le"" instead of ""la"" because Rosetta Stone just shows you what to use with certain words...it doesn't explain WHY. That has been frustrating for me and is making things more challenging as I progress through the lessons.Still, for my purposes, Rosetta Stone suits me just fine.

This system has given me a new appreciation for the language I was once scared of.The Rosetta Stone TOTALe packaging seemed big, until I opened it up and saw how much was crammed into the box:A nice USB headphone set, with built in microphone and padded ear cups.The actual Rosetta Stone software, for both Mac and PC, and the language specific lessons.Clear stick on labels for your keyboard (to help with the writing portion of the lessons).A CD/mp3 audio companion disc for practicing on the go or in your leisure time.A quick start guide.Authorization card to successfully install and use the software.Warranty information.The initial software install seemed to take a little bit of time, not more than 5 minutes though, but once it was finished the program started right up. The program automatically checked for software updates and gave me the option to download or continue with set up. I decided to download the update and I had to go through an installation for the update, but it went much more quickly than the first. Finally, after the program restarted and I selected the included microphone headset, I was asked to install the language I was working on.After placing the French I disc in and selecting the course, the program prompted that my drive only had space for 3 total courses (French I, II, and III), each at about 600mb. Hard drives are getting cheaper, but I thought it was worth noting that the entire French I course (this set you're looking at) is going to take about 600mb of space; I know that hard drive space can be an issue for some people.I was asked to input the activation code found on a card inside the package. I put the code in and the program connected online to verify it was legitimate.  When the authorization was complete, I was asked to fill out a profile, with my name and date of birth. I was given the option to also take part in the online sessions, which would allow me to practice my new skills with people proficient in the language. I noticed that I was offered a free 3 month trial period. I opted not to sign up for that feature, so I can't comment on its performance. Finally, there was a short introductory video (which I skipped since I'd already watched it online), at that point I was free to start my lessons.I picked the extended reading, writing, and speaking lessons, but there were options for reading and speaking only or reading and writing only, and so on. The core lesson takes you through the basics of the language, doing so only in French. It's full immersion and I was awestruck at how quickly I was picking things up, especially having never studied French. The use of descriptive images and repetitive audio cues, had me speaking a language and knowing what I was saying in matter of minutes. In less than ten minutes I knew several nouns and 3rd person pronouns, both male and female, and their spelling and I had gained the ability to spell and pronounce a number of activities (reading, drinking, eating, running, etc.). It was inspiring to feel successful, especially when half way through the lesson the words disappeared from the screen and I had make the right connections using what I had just learned.When all is said and done, I know I'm not going to be able to move to France and be mistaken as a native because of my excellent pronunciation and conversational skills learned from this program, but as a foundation for further learning and studying, it would be hard to beat this system.

It's true.While doing level 1, after each lesson I was wondering when I was going to learn the basics of French, like say, how to say what your name is or ask how someone is... a va? None of that is covered in level 1. (And so far not in level 2 either...) It's just a bunch of nouns overall. It teaches items and things VERY well, but not how to speak or understand French, which is what I thought was going to happen. The images are super helpful with stuff like that.

It's got good voice recognition software and the use of pictures and the way it tests you to make sure you understand what's going on, allows users to build vocabulary quickly.Note:::There will be a portion of the population, like myself, that will absolutely need to have the system of conjugation written down for them to `see' the logic of it, but that doesn't really detract from the software in my opinion.What does detract is the ""beta"" feel of the administrative part of the software.  Installation and maintenance have been a royal pain in the tuckus.I think my husband described it best when he said:  `Their software is very tightly scripted, but not very adaptive.  If your system is at all different from what the Rosetta Stone programmers anticipated, you will on the phone with the help desk for considerable time.'  That said, their help desk was helpful.INSTALLATION:::  Installation wasn't all that smooth for us.  After we installed the software, it gave us a notice that we needed to upgrade our O/S (a new service pack) and a new version of the Rosetta Stone software's engine. Plus there was some difficulty getting the headphones working, but I can't recall now exactly where the problem lay.MAINTENANCE:::  Yes, who knew there was maintenance.True to form, everything was running exceedingly smoothly for my husband, myself, and my 10 year-old daughter UNTIL the pop-up of death appeared that demanded that it be allowed to install an update.  Being a cautious soul I tried to back out as I `didn't want an update thank you', but guess what.  The software would no longer work.  No more French learning without the update :(Well, since that was a no go, I allowed the  update.  And guess what.  No more French learning.  In fact, the update hosed things up for a good long while, at least until someone had time to call the help desk and spend a good hour fixing the problem.It was amazing how much information was needed to do this.  We had to give the tech not only the Rosetta Stone key, but also  everything about our computer including the clock rate. Go figure. I suppose they are adding to their database trying to narrow in on where the problems are coming from.In any case, it turned out that there was a hidden file that needed to be deleted.  This file told the system that the upgrade was in progress, when in fact it had failed.  There was also a problem that stemmed from the fact that we have different profiles on this particular computer.  One for adults, one for kids.  In the end though that was resolved as well.THE SKINNY:::You are probably surprised by the 4-Stars I've given this program.  But honestly I don't think there's anything that compares to the Rosetta Stone method of learning.My advice would be to only install this software on a newer machine and if possible not allow that computer to connect to the internet until you are ready to use the online features.

They show you pictures and then show you the French word, pronounce it for you, and then you say it. It reviews the same things in different ways so practicing the words is not dry and boring. You can do it on your time and at your own pace. It also teaches you the four areas of language - speaking, listening, reading and writing. It offers activities that have you practice a combination of skills (reading and writing over listening and speaking), as well as lessons that focus on just one of the skills.

I learned enough to figure out words in reading, but didn't excel much at the oral part.  I tried this item out for that.  The other one I had for review was the Spanish one.  I gave it one star less than this, though it is pretty much the same program.  I learned more with this kit than the Spanish one, since I took four years of Spanish in high school and retain a lot of it still.  I am still not sure about how to find how much the online lessons are once my trial period of three months that you get free with the kit is over. It is hard to find on the website.  I like the games and layout of the Rosetta Stone program and I am a visual learner and this helps me with the oral part as well.  I like to see as I speak, which is hard to do with audio programs.  This has audio CDs for the car, video games for my computer and online help once I get my French up to speed.  My only complaint about this program is that you can only install in on one computer, so I have one of these on my laptop and the Spanish one on my home computer, since it takes up a good chunk of memory.  I would like the option to put these on any new computers I buy years from now, but RS has a very limited use.  It's like buying a course.  If you have a computer you will use for 5-6 years, it is really worth it.  If you work at home in a field where you need to upgrade your computer more often, you might be disappointed that you can't put it on your new computer.  I wish RS would allow at least this to be installed on two computer, in case the computer you are using fails.This is like taking one semester of French, beginner level, in high school or college.  I learned about the same thing I did in the French course in college and it is less money to do it this way.I think if you are a visual learner, you will like this product.  There is a lot of debate that kids learn better this way, but I think adults can too.  Mind you, that this teaches you very basic French and not beyond present tense really.  Just like a college course.  I like that I can see the words and tend to repeat them better when I see a picture at the same time.  Or maybe I am just a child at heart!Note: I have been using this and another Rosetta Stone for several weeks now and the headset that comes with it has a microphone that isn't so good. Or maybe with use had become not so good. Both my boyfriend and I have trouble getting the microphone to register words we say, even if we say it correctly. For example, even simple Spanish words like Si and Hola get a negative signal even though I am saying it perfectly. I continue at the same volume about 5 times and then, it finally takes it. I wonder if it will become frustrating on high levels where you have to repeat back longer sentences. My Mac doesn't have an external mic, so I have no option but to use the headset and take it off to speak as loud as I can into the microphone. It doesn't seem to matter if I do their ""1,2,3,4,5"" test at regular voice, louder or softer.

The friends I made had a quiz they liked to use: ""What do you call a person who speaks three languages? Trilingual;  What do you call a person who speaks two languages?  Bilingual; What do you call a person who speaks one language?  American.I have wanted to improve my language status for many years.  My High School Latin teacher said that after I learned Latin, the other romance languages would be easy.  I considered the other romance languages (Spanish, Portugese, Italian. Aragonese, Aromanian, Arpitan, Asturian, Corsican, Emiliano-Romagnolo, Friulan, Galician, Ladino, Leonese, Lombard, Mirandese, Neapolitan, Occitan, Piedmontese, Romansh, Sardinian, Sicilian, Venetian and Walloon), only the major four (French, Spanish, Italian, and Portugese were attractive to me, but then I saw this offer from Rosetta Stone and I chose French.Learning French was easier than I thought.  Of course the grammar I learned in my four years studying Latin made French grammar easier.  Well, and I did get a French grammar text and a French dictionary, since Rosetta Level 1 is limited in grammar.  After a few months using the interactive program, I began to feel comfortable speaking the language.I was tempted to brag to my family that I now speak French, then I realized that I had yet to converse in French with another human.  Soon I remembered my years living in Germany.  I had studied German, but could not really have a meaningful conversation with a German.  When I said something in German, they would answer in English (somehow they knew I was an American).  Those who did not speak English (maybe one percent of those I encountered) used a different dialect, and I was back to using my German book and pointing to words.  The lesson for me is that now I must spend some time in France if I really want to learn the language.  Oh well, I can read French as long as people do not get technical.Recently I thought of a possible answer to the dilemma I have with my European friends.  I could learn to speak Walloon, Friulan, and Arpitan.  I am unlikely to encounter anyone who speaks those languages, so no one to question whether I really know it.

These reviews should be about the learning aspect of RS, not technical difficulties. I have had a couple of minor glitches, but RS customer service was responsive.I understand the methodology. In a nutshell, I feel that even minimal information on verb tenses or sentence structure or article usage would be incredibly helpful. Fortunately, my Austrian friends are there to help me (although they seem to think I'm silly to try to learn German when they are happy to speak English to me when I visit!). One friend sent me to this [...] to help me understand. It was very early on in Level 1 that I was confused by all the endings added on without explanation. Yes, you may pick up the patterns at some point, but a bit of explanation would be easier.That said, there is so much repetition, you need not fear the next lesson. And it is pretty enjoyable on the whole. I grew up hearing a little bit of German/Yiddish, so the pronunciation has been easy for me. I am a bit fanatical about accents, so I want to get it right. I am bugged that occasionally the voices will differ during the lesson. Ex.: the pronunciation lessons for 'und' and 'fahrrad' make clear that you hit the D pretty much like a T; but when the female voice says 'fahrrad,' she says it like a D.  Same with 'und'--the male voice says it as a D in one phrase.It's hard to imagine becoming anywhere near fluent without the rules and such, but I'm reviewing Level 1, so that's not for me to say.The headset is very nice and solid.

I used this for months, as I had German friends traveling to the US and wanted to be able to offer conversation in their native language.  This software fell short (by a long shot).  The pictures work well, but at times can be confusing.  Often, no matter how I spoke a phrase, it would tell me I'm incorrect, conversely, at times when I've been horribly off, I've gotten credit.  The software is easy to use, and reliable, but even receiving a response from their team is like pulling teeth. I had contacted them numerous times for explanations (there's no key or anything textual for me to use as reference other than an alphabet references, just pictures...and figuring those out can be a difficult task as well) and was given very generic responses that led me nowhere.  As the lessons went on, the language became more confusing.  There were articles and demonstratives that were extremely confusing, and I couldn't figure out if they were based on the object or gender/plurality of those speaking (nominative, etc).  I received no verification from Rosetta, simply referring to the dictionary reference, which was of no help. I even attended an online Q&A, which they glossed over my question without an answer! They quickly read it and basically, nonchalantly, referred back to the above, unhelpful reference I was given before. Given the amount you pay for this software, they should provide other pertinent lessons on what I've mentioned (it's an entire topic that could be lent to itself). I was constantly bombarded with emails and pop-ups trying to get me to buy more support or more software, yet I couldn't get anyone to answer my questions and often had to use Google Translate or a plain search on the internet. I think German is quite difficult for a native English speaker to grasp with just this software.  I would recommend this if you have a basic knowledge of a particular language, as it's good for brushing up.  But, for me (and for German), I would not recommend Rosetta Stone.

I like that it appeals to both my visual learning style and that you can increase the difficulty of pronunciation fluency.Level One covers some pretty basic stuff - things like ""newspaper"", ""egg"" and very easy/common words that you would likely learn early on if immersed in the culture you are studying, which is where I agree with the product description. The headset works with decent reliability but sometimes does not want to let me ""pass"" on a certain word no matter how many times I've said it or how accurate I think I am.

Hopefully you get the gist.)""Rosetta Stone works; but I am the type of learner where complete immersion, repetition, and activities work.  If you have access to Rosetta Online, I recommend the Bingo game and going through the stories.  When using Stories, first listen to it and try to visualize every said detail, then read it.  Doing this paired with the Audio has helped me tremendously.I do find problems with pronunciation. Some of my pronunciation errors are right, but there are a few (e.g. alt, Jahre, Bruder, Englisch) that I have to over-exaggerate certain (wrong sounding) noises to get it to accept. That is REALLY frustrating because I don't hear what I'm incorrectly saying.  What's also frustrating is that it'll accept many other words that I'm nowhere near to pronouncing correctly.  ""Uuuuuuh..."" is sometimes accepted! The pronunciation quirks pester me the most when using this program, but I can't say I run into them too much where it deters me from wanting to continue through the lessons.The Milestones at the end the four units are a bit intimidating especially if you don't use the online resources.  I am usually at a lost for what to say.  It's not obvious all the time.  In this situation, just remain silent.  The program will think there's an error with the microphone. When you have formed the sentence in your mind, continue with the activity.I never use this program without Google Translate opened next to it.  I don't use it to decipher whole sentences or phrases, just a couple words here and there.I don't lean too hard on Google for interpretation because after a while, a learner will see that German words do not correlate to just one meaning.  ""Sie"" can mean she, you, they, it and so on. The meaning depends on the overall sentence.  So it's important to try to think German and try not to interpret every word directly to English.  Rosetta Stone does a good job of giving visuals to let you think in German, but it does not explain any of the Grammar or word rules.  This is why I'm shopping for a German grammar book on Amazon.EXAMPLE: The more I research, the more I see how important it is to when to use ""sie"" and ""du"". Both mean ""you,"" but one is formal and good for strangers and the other is used among friends and family.  And my understanding is that depending on what ""you"" we use makes a difference on the spelling of other words in the same sentence.As someone has mentioned, there's no glossary of words in Rosetta Stone.  So when I want to double-check my spelling or the words I'm using, I have to use Google Translate.****CORRECTION UPDATE**** There is a document of words and phrases learned.  It's located on the CD under ""Documentation"". ****July 12****Overall, I am very pleased with this program and the progress that I am making.  The price is fair to me because it cost less than taking a semester course at my local college and I can access this as many times as I want... whenever I want. Rosetta Stone isn't totally complete with everything you need; and that's why I pair it with Google and other books and tools.  However, that doesn't mean that this doesn't work or isn't worth your investment.  If you understand that learning a language takes constant work and you are determined to teach yourself, buy this. This software is like a teacher.  And since I'm a student, it is up to me to do my homework.",4.0,"I love it, but it has its frustrations.",1309824000,"07 5, 2011",Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,1.0

I purchased the program a few years ago in preparation for a dream trip to Germany.  Within a very short time and with minimal effort on my part, I had more than mastered German, I was speaking it like a native.  I know this because so many people in Germany were shocked to learn I am an American and often refused to believe my accent was not Bavarian.  A few even insisted I was a native German and were adamant I must be joking.  When I told people that I was making my first visit to Germany and was from California, it was not unusual to see a shake of the head accompanied by a hearty laugh.  While there, I had no problem reading train schedules, maps, or even a bit of Goethe when a new German friend recommended him.  I especially enjoyed Wagner when I attended the Bayreuth Opera festival and am very glad indeed that I made that side trip.  Rosetta Stone has broadened my horizons and flung open so many cultural doors that I can not begin to recommend it enough.  Considering my desire to speak and read German simply began with my interest in World War II, it is truly wondrous how much more I have learned there is to German art and culture.  There is certainly more to this beautiful country than militarism and goosestepping parades of troops.  Once one masters the language, entirely new and magnificent vistas come into view.  The subtlety of the tongue introduces you to a warm and loving people who have been deeply misunderstood, often due to communication barriers and semantics.  Rosetta Stone offers the opportunity to all of us to grow closer to one another and to embrace all of humanity through language.  I am currently mastering Japanese and plan to move on to French shortly.  Perhaps the most significant thing I have learned through the wonder that is Rosetta Stone is that there are no limits to what I am capable of learning and to never again turn away from an intellectual challenge.  Even in middle age, it is both easy and fun to learn any new language and to become as fluent as you wish.  Already my Japanese neighbor has asked me how many years I lived in Japan as a child and if I went to school near Kyoto!",5.0,Incredible,1376611200,"08 16, 2013",Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,1.0

If you get Rosetta Stone you will need to use a Greek Dictionary and have a tutor to help you interpret what is going on.  If you just wing it without, you will never really understand what you are doing.  You have photo's and sentences and words, but there is no explanation as to what Rosetta Stone is doing or why.  In my humble opinion, it would not be too difficult to make a better product than Rosetta Stone.  All you would need to do is offer some explanations as well as use a different format in some cases.  An advantage is found in the use of the text to speech verification.  However, as for the photos, it is a nifty idea, but the TV is a better visual medium then this, and it is no help at all. So photos alone are not the answer, although it is good idea.  Rosetta Stone also has various glitches.  For example, there will be a sentence, and you have to match it with a photo.  After you get the answer correct there is no way to *easily* check to see what was said in writing without going back where all the sentences are flashed off in the beginning.  They also use the same format for every language, I really question how committed they are to teaching the best way for each language.  I hear they throw in TV and other such things in Latin.There is a WIDE MARGIN for improvements here, so keep your eyes open for the next product, I know I will.

I learned Spanish through classrooms and textbooks, and although I am fluent, I occasionally get this frustrated feeling like I'm missing a piece, like having skipped a page in a novel but not knowing which page. I learned American Sign Language in a totally natural environment, by contrast, and I feel as at home in ASL as I do in English (my first language). This program feels a lot more like my ASL learning experience than my Spanish experience.I got it to learn as much Greek as possible in about six months, before I go to Greece. I just cracked it open a few days ago, and already I am speaking in full sentences. Granted, they are guided sentences, but I have already pieced together quite a few novel sentences using the vocabulary and grammar I have already picked up. I'm impressed, and I know enough about language learning that being impressed by a piece of software is a pretty big statement for me.Initially I thought I would just learn the absolute basics, enough to survive Greece by myself without an interpreter. But I'm only on level 1, unit 1, lesson 3, and I already see that I am going to learn (and retain) a lot more than survival Greek. I haven't peeked ahead at level two yet, but, judging by how much is packed into the first three lessons, I would guess that each level is superior to an entire semester of a college class, at roughly a third of the price.My only wish so far is that it came with a very basic book of grammar and spelling rules. I do think the program is well-designed, providing careful contrast in each phrase/sentence so that you can figure out the rules as you go, which is the most natural way of doing it. But it would be nice to have a book to go to just for the sake of verifying my success at cracking the code.

I did have a very small vocabulary already of some Hebrew words and phrases before I bought this.  In all I would say I knew about 100 words, and short phrases such as asking someone how they are, and I did learn how to tell someone that I did not speak Hebrew and ask if they spoke English.  Very basic, but still maybe more than a lot of people getting this program.So here is what I do not like about it.  I understand the importance of immersion, and there is not a speck of English in these lessons, and that is the problem, because no English also means no written English as well.  When pictures are put up you will hear the Hebrew word for it, and it will also be spelled using the Hebrew Alphabet, which of course means nothing to me, or to you if you don't know Hebrew, you obviously don't know the Alphabet.  It would be nice if they had a phonetic spelling of the words in English (like the Hebrew-English phrase books that I own).  I find this to be a big help, being able to read the word helps me to remember and associate the picture to the word, and also helps with pronouncing it.To be honest, I have gotten more useful Hebrew out of the Pimsleur series of introductory Hebrew.  With that I can already speak complete sentences and have small conversations, and order in restaurants etc, and those I can listen to in the car, or at the gym and they cost much less.  As you can see between Rosetta, Pimsleur, and my phrase books, I have taken learning Hebrew pretty seriously, and have invested a good amount on it.  I won't say that I have not gotten anything out of Rosetta Stone, but it is not as magical as the adds that you may have seen make it out to be, and again, I think this may pertain to languages where the alphabet and the characters are so different from English.The last criticism that I have is the included audio files that you get with it that you can download to iTunes.  I was really excited about that until I played them.  All they have is someone saying the Hebrew words from the lessons on them.  Not even the English word first, then the Hebrew word so that you know what it is.  It is like listening to a Hebrew movie or TV show with your eyes closed.  You have no idea what the word means if you don't already know it.  And if you have heard the word before but are not 100% sure on what it is, there is nothing to remind you, either you know it, or you don't, and that is confusing and frustrating.  I don't know how anyone could find that useful.  After about 15 minutes of listening and realizing this I didn't even bother listening to another, and went right back to my Pimsleur cd's.Everyone learns differently, so what is not helpful for me, may be fine for you, but if you think this type of immersion learning is right for you, then go for it, because if you can learn that way, then I think you'd be rocking Hebrew in no time.",3.0,Not as good as everyone makes you think it is,1335744000,"04 30, 2012",Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,0.0

Because Pimsleur does not use writing in the earlier lessons, (that is a good decision for languages that use our alphabet because we need to learn the sounds and not pronounce the letters as they are in our language.) But, Hindi used a completely different set of characters that are very important to the speaker. So, we learn the pronunciation and sounds, and Rosetta Stone for the other needed parts.We have also used Pimsleur for German and Russian and there have no need for Rosetta Stone.We were using this program to work with the script. It was version 4, which Rosetta Stone says can be put on two computers for five students in a family. That is not true. Because of my eyesight I needed to use a larger screen so I tried to put it on a second computer. It would not activate. I had to delete it from the laptop it was on before I could change it.When I deleted it from the laptop it gave me a set of two numbers, one was the Activation Key, which I already had, and another was the delete number. You had to send both Rosetta Stone before you could activate the program on the exchange computer. Due to a glitch, (in the computer world - one that I have been in since 1979 - glitches happen) and I lost the delete number. I tried to contact Rosetta Stone and work things out so that I could use the program on my larger screen.EDIT: The product now works on both computers. They must have straightened it out in house, but they did not communicate this with me, so I found out by accident. Rosetta Stone is a viable help to Pimsleur since it does have pictures with the words and helps one to visualize certain things. They also help with the Hindi phonetic system and, since that is so different than the Western Alphabet, the help is appreciated. The product is fine, a bit overpriced, but a viable addition to Pimsleur for Hindi. I would not need it for something like German. I can give it two stars now.

Previously, I learned from a few sources, which included an audio CD and several ""Instant Italian"" pocket guides.  Having tried the Rosetta Stone method, I cannot go back to the other ways.  It works.The Rosetta Stone method breaks down and simplifies language learning more intuitively than other programs and methods I've tried.  It does not emphasize grammar rules or vocabulary lists.  Rather, it provides an environment where you learn by associating words with images.  This curriculum follows some of the basic principles in many immersion education programs, and mimics the way language is taught to a small child.  In my opinion and experience, this association method helps to increase retention, and makes learning much more intuitive.This package has a very good speech recognition system integrated into the program.  This helps to improve the learning process, since it gives feedback on accent and pronunciation, and improves your ability to speak as well.What I liked:Interactive software - I was able to apply what I learned after each lesson.It also comes with a headset+microphone to help with the pronounciation.  BIG PLUS!Audio companion - I loaded up these lessons on my MPT3 player and I was able to practice while driving to and from work.Online Lessons - I liked the practice sessions, and having native Italian speakers is a huge plus.I was able to perfect my pronunciation with this set.  There is an online community that you can join and participate with others online.  It's a very nice addition, and something that seems exclusive to Rosetta.  However, this feature is only available without extra cost for 3 months, after this trial period it is $25/month, or $149 for 15 months.  I finished the software lessons, went through it again, and then used the online feature.What I didn't like:My only issue is the price.  It is very expensive!  In some sense, you get what you pay for, and with this you pay a premium.

I believe it's the Total-e version, but I'm not sure by how it's worded on this site today (6/28/11).I purchased my copy in August 2010, so I think it may be the previous version. I do not have Total-e.With all that said, I would like to review the software I do have, which I can confirm does match very closely with the description of the software on this page.It is, in a word, EXCELLENT. There are some things about it that are hard to understand, but I honestly don't know how a software program for learning this difficult language could be any better than what Rosetta Stone's (RS) produced.The previous reviewer was complaining that this software is inadequate, because you don't know how to read the script. That is true initially, but leads me to believe that he didn't go very far in the software, because they DO start to teach you to read devanagari within the first unit of level one. It is a fair criticism from the previous reviewer that the foundation they offer is different from what you'd expect. I'm accustomed to learning tourism-friendly phrases first, like to ask where the train station is, etc. RS is NOT like that at all.I knew only the words for some food dishes and for water in Hindi before I started this software, and I could not read a single character in the devanagari syllabary. I was starting from nothing. I have used the Spanish software from RS, and agree that it is to an English speakers definite advantage that Spanish uses the same alphabet we use. However, it is MUCH more complicated to craft a language learning software program in a totally different script. Now that I've spent several months off and on with the program, I appreciate their approach. It would be way too overwhelming to try to learn devanagari first, and then start speaking. 99% of people would quit, because the syllabary is so large and so different from our alphabet.Here is what RS does: They show you pictures, and you hear native speakers talking. You can't read what it says, so you must listen closely. The first unit of level one was tough, I'm not gonna lie. I had to do it a couple of times before I got the hang of it. Then, I just took off. I spent probably 3 or 4 hours with the software on the first day, and by the end of that day, I was able to say ""the girl is eating rice"". Awesome! I think being able to form a simple sentence so quickly helped keep me engaged and confident, which = motivated.True, it does seem to start you off speaking phrases that are not what you commonly find in language learning resources. I'm only a little more than halfway through level one (because I've been going sporadically, have been redoing sections, etc), and I still haven't learned how to say goodbye or thank you. However, I can ask what something is, describe activities that people are doing, say that ""the woman is reading her newspaper,"" ""the man is wearing his coat,"" ""one black cat is under the table,"" and other such phrases that took me MUCH longer to learn using other language learning techniques. I studied Spanish for two years in high school, and never learned how to say these kinds of sentences.They introduce the characters of the devanagari syllabary slowly. I probably know about 20-25 of them by now. As I mentioned earlier, I'm glad they're going slowly, or else I would get frustrated and bored.The real beauty of RS is that you quickly get to the point where the words just roll off your tongue, unlike when you study a language in a classroom setting and get good at taking tests, but end up tongue tied, because you haven't learned how to have a conversation. RS's emphasis on what they call ""dynamic immersion"" is so right on the mark. I cannot say enough good things about their approach to language learning.The software is expensive. But guess what? So are classes, and so is going to another country for an immersion at a language school. If you total up the cost of taking language classes at a community college or going to Mexico or Guatemala to study Spanish (for example), this is BY FAR the best value for your money. Why? Because you can return to it at any time. You can practice in the middle of the night, if you want. If you're shy about making mistakes (like me), it doesn't matter, because you're talking to a computer, and you can always redo a lesson for a better score!If you get this software, one tip I have is to ask for help from a native speaker, if you know anyone. If not, then use their Total-e options. I've needed to ask my boyfriend a few questions, and I'm lucky I have him around as a resource, so I didn't need to get or use Total-e.",5.0,Best way to learn Hindi short of going to study it in India,1309219200,"06 28, 2011",Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,1.0

This means you'll learn more effectively, as your brain is forced to make certain connections on its own.  Additionally, when you see pictures, for example, of a ""male"", the picture will be different each time: one time might be a young boy, and then it might be an old man, then a young man, and so on... and the first time you see the picture you might think it is a boy, but when the second picture pops up you realize that the word must mean something else, and you relate the two, and pick the commonality.  Anyway, this is a hard example, and it is simpler than this, but the idea is that you see different pictures representing each word, each time.++ WELL DESIGNED/VARIED -there are multiple modules which are scattered throughout -listening & comprehension, reading, pronunciation, typing, and so on.  It is impressive.++ GOOD REVIEWS -when I finished a section I was happy to find out that many of the concepts came back --not right away, but later when they weren't the freshest in my mind-- this meant I had to remember it, and basically memorized it through this recall.  I thought Rosetta Stone did a great job bringing up concepts and reminding me of the concepts later on.  I did not feel the need to review previous lessons...++ PAINLESS.  This system is about as fun (can I say that?) and as painless as a computer aided language learning system can get.NEGATIVES:--- PRICE, PRICE, PRICE -for most people the $200 cost for a single lesson (less as you buy more modules) is really too high.  Yes I know these things cost money, and I know they are better than other systems, but the pricing suggests that they are worried you won't like it, and you'll feel pressured to continue because you spent so much, OR, they are trying to convince you to pay only a few hundred more to get the whole set.  I'd argue they'd be better off dropping the price in half for the first module, and then I'd recommend it more.  (And give me some sort of discount if I buy lesson 2 separately.  I am not going to buy multiple modules without buying the first one, and testing it out.  $500 for the set is too much of a committment without giving it a shot first.)- READING EXERCISES ARE BUGGY SOMETIMES -I have spent 5 minutes (unsuccessfully) on several sections where I am supposed to say just one syllable, and the voice recognition system fails.  I mean, I KNOW what I am hearing, I have studied 4 languages, have good pronunciation, and I can't for the life of me get the computer to believe I said ""PO"" (for example) instead of something unrecognizable.  It was very frustrating, as I tried to enunciate it every way imaginable, with no luck.  Yet, when It was a multi-syllabic word (with the same syllable) the computer had no problem.- NO DICTIONARY -yes, I know this isn't part of their system, but it would have been nice to have a dictionary so that I could learn some additional words on my own.  (Sometimes you just don't want to wait to lesson 5 to learn numbers, for example...)But probably the biggest criticism is that this program is no substitute for classroom participation.  (Yes, I know that there are some online modules that you can pay more for, but I wasn't interested in paying any more...)My wife was taking classroom Italian at the same time I was doing this system, and we would compare experiences.  One thing I noticed is that the ""putting-sentences-together-on-my-own-and-saying-them"" part of Rosetta Stone, was one of the weaker sections.  She, on the other hand, got many opportunities to practice.  Mine was more about listening and comprehension.Overall, if classroom Italian really isn't an option for you, because you don't have the time or you just don't like classrooms, AND you have a lot of money to spend, then I'd say this is a good deal.  (If I were forced to move overseas I would definitely invest in the system.)But, if you are a starving student, then you're better off looking for other books and CDs from the library before trying this system.Recommended, but with reservations.",4.0,"Nice system, but way too expensive.",1340150400,"06 20, 2012",Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,1.0

I am hearing stories from other homeschoolers who have used RS for multiple years and who were happy with RS, that they are too lacking in grammar to perform well on the SAT II test (the SAT subject test is now required by some colleges for admission), so they are suddenly unhappy with RS but it's too late to do anything about it.

If you desire a stronger grammar component, before buying RS you should look into a newer productFluenz Italian 1 with supplemental Audio CD and Podcastswhich seems just like RS but with more grammar (and is similarly priced).Also if you are a homeschooling parent you should know there is a ""RSFluenz Italian 1+2 with supplemental Audio CDs and Podcastshomeschool package"" (see the RS website for info), which may be better than this `standard' product for your homeschool.--RS was easy to install, we had no problem getting it started on our Windows PC. There was some confusion over activating the online account, which is free for 90 days only, which we wound up not using anyway, as the base lessons were enough. We misunderstood the directions and thought we HAD to register online to start using it, but that doesn't seem to be correct.To test RS I used it, as did both of my homeschooled kids (aged 10 and 13). The only system glitch we have sometimes was the headset would not activate sometimes, when switching between users who attempt to use RS right after someone else used it. The fix that works is rebooting the PC.The program prompts the user to speak into the headset and it checks the accuracy. One of my kids (a newbie to learning foreign language) seems to have a problem and he blames the headset or the program for hearing him wrong but in RS's defense when I listen to the sample and then what my son is saying I detect a minor intonation error on my son's part or the emphasis part of the word is not being emphasized strongly enough, so the problem is my SON not the system. My other son has this problem once in a while only. I have not experienced this myself as after years of taking French in public school and college I have trained my ear to listen very carefully and also keep telling myself to not use Standard English speaking patterns (my son keeps overriding the Italian and inserting a more English language sound). I keep emphasizing to my sons to watch the voice recognition graph so they can see where there is a problem (it's a pretty cool feature). I mention this as perhaps other users may have this issue and might think the voice recognition software is faulty when really it is the user!This product is marketed to adults not just children. As an adult learner who formerly learned in a very different way this RS method of learning felt odd to me. I wanted to see things written out that I could look at (I'm a strong visual-text learner). Don't laugh but it took me a while to figure out what I was saying, not realizing for example that in Italian there is a pronoun for multiple females as ""they"". It was a bit odd to jump right in learning multiple pronouns that we don't use in English and also to use the verb conjugations without seeing anything in writing to explain it. I was having memory flashbacks of my school's French textbook that had the nice list of conjugations so I could read it written out while I was reciting it orally to help cement it in my mind. This way of learning the pronoun and verb when looking at just a color photo of the scene being referenced is so different for me, however it appeals to people who have a stronger sense of visual-image learning or for auditory learners. I still feel I need some kind of rule list to see in front of me, I found it hard to both learn the content and think to try to figure out the rules myself right in the middle of the lessons. For example, there is no direct teaching of which noun is feminine versus masculine and how that affects both the ending of the noun and the choice of verb to use with it. I had to figure out that `a' at the end is typically feminine and that `o' is typically masculine. I only knew about the existence of gender differences for non-living things from my former French classes; to my English speaking kids this is all new and is being taught without a basic, direct explanation. The RS method goes all the way back to how babies and toddlers learn to speak a native language and teaches it that way. (I think I will look for a supplemental book to supply this information.)My kids are flying through the lessons and really love it. To them it doesn't feel like work, they find it fun. As the program goes on there is more of a written component using the keyboard to type in material.The system is easy to use and I like the way it keeps a score and how you can't progress past certain points without getting a certain high score. It is easy to navigate through the menu in order to re-do selected lessons.We have been using Rosetta Stone Italian I for about two months and enjoy it. As a homeschooling family, if we were to purchase Rosetta Stone new I'd purchase the homeschool package not the standard package. I also would seriously consider usingFluenz Italian 1 with supplemental Audio CD and Podcastsinstead of Rosetta Stone for a stronger grammar element, but I've not been able to see Fluenz in real life yet (there are online video samples to view on Amazon.com though).  I'm sorry that I can't do a comparison between the two.",4.0,Best for Auditory and Visual Image Learners - Has Been Criticized for Lacking Grammar,1302393600,"04 10, 2011",Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,1.0

Never was able to get past the bare basics in high school language classes (German) and, despite the fact that both my parents were born and raised in Italy, I've never been able to get much traction in Italian either.The Rosetta Stone software, however, is making a difference. No, I can't say that after using the software for a week that I'm fluent in Italian, but I am making progress. It's a very comfortable way to learn the language, especially since it's self-paced and offers tools (the headset/microphone) to help out with pronunciation, a particular stumbling block for me. Since I'm so slow at picking up a language (and self-conscious about it), I'm finding this type of robust, immersive self-study to be far more effective than classroom learning.A minor nit to pick -- I wish the headset quality was a bit better since it's such an important tool in the process. It's adequate, but given the price tag for the product, better sound quality and usage comfort would be welcomed.This is only Level 1 Italian, so the language skills taught are just the basics. Think of it as a way to get your feet wet with a new language.

""Do those things actually work?"" is the question most people ask us when they hear we have one. You know, they actually do. From my dyslexic sister to my stroke-victim mother, Rosetta Stone meets the challenges of teaching a wide range of people and at a wide range of natural ability.My personal failure to learn a foreign language is legendary. I took years of both high school and college Spanish--can't speak it. I got all the way to intermediate American Sign Language with college courses--can't get past spelling my name. I have failed at Korean, German, and French with equal aplomb. So as someone who has used tapes, CDs, computer programs, traditional school-room methods and real live people willing to teach me, let me say with some authority that Rosetta Stone is not only the best language learning device I have ever seen it is the only way I would ever recommend learning a foreign language outside of parachuting into a foreign country and stumbling around until you figure out what people are trying to tell you (otherwise known as ""total immersion""). The lessons are challenging without being frustrating, the method is entertaining on a certain level, and the results immediate and noticeable.I like learning and I liked school, so I didn't mind working my way through the program. The real surprise was my little sister. She is severely dyslexic and absolutely hated most of her school life. She took to this like I couldn't believe, coming over to my house just for her ""lessons"" and sitting for hours quietly working through the program. She's rarely shown such devotion to learning and certainly not on her own free time. I also plan to set up an account for my mother, who had a series of strokes a few years back and is on disability. She could never learn a language in a classroom or by a rote memorization method (she can't remember what she did an hour ago) but she could learn this. I have never come across a learning program that works in the face of so many different kinds of obstacles.Weak spots are minor and few. The microphone included with the set doesn't always pick up voice correctly (for the amount they charge they should use a top-quality mike). The ""games"" in the program are tedious and have a thrown-together-at-the-last-moment-feel. I did not use the online functions because I really really detest the current trend of nickel and diming people to death with ""subscriptions"" for every little thing. If you shell out hundreds of dollars you should get all you need and you should own it clear and outright. But if you don't mind paying for a subscription when your free two months runs out this would not be a demerit. I wanted to review the program without the online functions for those that would not/could not use them, and I think the set is perfectly adequate as is.For homeschooled kids, children with learning disabilities, baby-boomers looking to keep their minds sharp, those planning an extended vacation, of if you just want to converse with the cute Italian guy at who works at the grocery store, Rosetta Stone is worth the money. Set up is easy and you're off and running in under ten minutes. Side effects include cravings for pasta and a desire to plan a trip to Lake Como.

I am not new to the Italian language, and obtained the product as a refresher, so I cannot say whether the 'total immersion' method would be effective for myself or universally. Second, I am a Vine reviewer, and had intended to order levels 1-5, but the last copy was gone by the time I'd selected my mailing address. Level 1 is much too elementary, even as a 'brush up', for one with previous knowledge of Italian.Nonetheless, I believe anyone using Rosetta Stone should find it to be stimulating and fun, as well as informative. The various exercises, capacity for interaction, and games transform what could be tedious into what I'm sure many will find a constant treat.Allowing for that the vocabulary at this level is not new to me, I must say that, since my memory is more visual than audio, and I find studying vocabulary in books to be helpful, I cannot say whether I could have picked up much had I depended only on this method.

In particular this is the case with pronunciation, as it's difficult to ensure you're saying things properly.  The Rosetta stone format helps immensely with this is as it provides active feedback with its microphone and headset.  I found this an important aspect because it keeps me motivated to continue practicing day in and out AND I'm ensured my practicing is proper.  Without active feedback, it's like learning to play a musical instrument without having anyone listen to you play - you may THINK you're playing well but really, you aren't, so the first time you try to perform, you'll get a lot of strange looks.  No different here.Downsides?  Need some fairly decent computing power to get this running.  I wouldn't touch it on anything less than a modern dual core.The level 1 is far too basic for anyone to just stop there.  One needs to continue onwards to at least level 5 to gain any noticeable appreciation in skills.  I know most will shy away from the higher levels because they cost so much.  It's hard for most people to push the button for a $400 software package these days.  Then again, you need to compare to getting professional lessons which will definitely cost you more.

It isn't a quick fix learning program for a tourist. It is a slow process, but rewarding as you go along so you will want to learn more.

This software does however provide you with a solid foundation that will allow you to use proper grammar and create proper sentence structure. Don't expect to know how to say ""caterpillar"" or ""kaleidoscope"" because if you do then you are expecting the impossible. If you finish the software and buy a vocabulary book, you will be in good shape. My best advice is to go on the rosetta stone website and try the interactive demo.

Total install time with level 1 language pack was maybe 20 minutes or less (there is a lot of data copied to the PC).Launching the software was straightforward and launching into the first lesson was easy.  The only issue I had was getting the included microphone/headset to work right.  It kept telling me to say ""1, 2, 3, 4, 5"" into the microphone, but it kept saying it couldn't configure the microphone.  I finally made some random noise into the mic and it worked fine.  In the lessons the mic worked fine.In the first lesson it was obvious what needed to be done.  I was slightly disappointed that the headset headphones did not play the audio, and instead the computer speakers played the audio, so why do I need a headset for just the microphone?  Oh well, no big deal, just different.I did the first lesson with my 5 year old son, and he enjoyed it a great deal too.  He quickly picked up what he needed to do for each lesson, but as a downside many of the lessons show only four pictures, so you can just start clicking on boxes until you get it right (an issue for my son).One thing I appreciated is the first lesson had absolutely no English.  It was only images and Italian words and speaking.  This is a better way to learn to make the association of the foreign word to the object instead of translating it in your head through your native tongue first.Maybe being level 1 it is easier on me, but I found I could be pretty far off in pronunciation and it would still accept my spoken words.  However, it is still nice to have some feedback if what your saying is close to correct, and this software provides that.I think this software is excellent, but the price of entry is high.  However, how much would it cost to take a foreign language class?  The textbook would probably cost at least 1/3rd what this software would cost.

Little has changed at the core of the learning system, which is by far and away a good thing.  If you're not familiar with how this program works, it is truly the most ""natural"" way to learn a language.Let me explain (if you do know how this works skip to the next paragraph for updates on the new features).  This program does the best it can to mimic a child-like learning environment, which is what everyone needs to learn.  I really mean it.  Think of it this way: how do children learn a language?  They imitate what they hear and see, right?  They do not have a concept early on of memorization.  Children do not memorize language, grammar, vocabulary, sentences, etc...they repeat what they hear, associate what they hear with what they see, and make mistakes as they go, slowly correcting themselves with guidance and observation and trial and error.  This program does the same thing, but with you, an adult (or so I presume for most readers of this review).  It shows you a picture, associates the word visually, and then through audition.  You then practice back by seeing, choosing, saying the words that you have learned.  You'll make mistakes, but will self-correct with this program just like a child would.  Practice will not make perfect, only permanent.  Hence, when you do practice, make sure to do it slowly and really understand what it is that you're saying, seeing, and hearing; this program makes it much easier than reading a book alone, or just listening to audio cassettes; it's truly an all-encompassing programs.  Memorization and just repetition is NOT the way to learn a language, and friend of mine who did this for 4 years (think Highschool) cannot speak a single sentence even though they were A students.  I, having been blessed with a teacher who forced us to live the language by all the ways that a mind can comprehend it, never memorized the language, and can speak it very well now (no medical terms, but good `ol conversation and banter).So, what's new here compared to V3?  I was pleasantly surprised that at least one of my previous suggestions in a previous review was taken seriously.  I had mentioned the need for you to practice with native speakers in order to really get the hang of a language.  And now, you get this chance with a short free trial.  I had also mentioned in the old review to make learning the language fun, as anything that's fun is instantly remembered for the long term better as we all know.  Rosetta Stone included games to play and enjoy.  I'm very happy that this company really listens to its customers and updates its products, instead of sticking to its guns thinking they figured everything out.  Two thumbs up for that.I HAVE NOT (reason forthcoming), yet tried the online sessions with the native speakers.  There's a reason for this, and I really hope you take note of this before purchasing this product.  First, I don't recommend purchasing level 1 of this language (and logically of any).  I want you to ask yourself why you want to learn this language?  To learn how to say ""pants"" and barely speak or comprehend a sentence, or to actually learn to have some minimal conversational skill?  I'm going to take a wild guess and say you fit into the latter category.  It makes no sense to me to ""try"" out learning a language and barely learn anything for such an EXPENSIVE program!  Unless you have money to burn skip buying the incomplete set, please.  I recommend that if you are REALLY truly serious about getting the hang of a language to a minimally conversational degree with just the software then get the entire set and save yourself money in the long-run (quite a bit I might add).  Then use the online native speakers to help you master your conversational abilities.  BUT, I emphasize, DO NOT waste your money activating your free trial of the native speaker engagement sessions (and games) until you have complete the entire program.  Why in the world would you take precious time and money to do such a thing when you'll just be able to spit back the names of colors and buildings back to one another?  Wait until you get semi-coherent and put your hard earned dollars to work only then, after mastering the program.

Since I am not a language expert, I had a hard time keeping up initially because different tenses of words, or the plural, were thrown in. Rosetta Stone relies on photographs to help you out, which is quite useful but I could not get a good grasp of the language to actually use it in normal speech. Once you start getting used to the phrases, the software begins to kick it up by throwing in more words. Unfortunately, like other users, the phrases are too simple for use in everyday conversation.The Level 1 kit includes a USB headset with a microphone to allow you to speak the phrases using the built-in speech recognition. This helps with pronunciation, although I found that it will disable my main audio and I have to switch back and forth.

Special characters are handled intuitively when writing via keyboard characters or mouse click.One downside to Rosetta Stone's approach is that grammar and spelling are a bit tougher to get.  There may be no substitute to old school drills and repetition here.The only thing preventing a five star review is that Rosetta Stone actually puts its security cards--needed to unlock higher lessons---in the flap of the software box.

It was the voice recognition I was leery of. Though I've studied two languages through classes, I have no aptitude for speaking languages at all. The languages I'm most familiar with are the Teutonic/Germanic gutteral sounding languages; I have such problems with the romance languages. I married into a Portuguese-American family and they still howl with laughter when, after 21 years, I attempt the language.In addition, I've broken my ear drums a couple times, and have suffered loss of hearing as a result (compounded, could be, by age!).I am very happy to say that I have had no problem hearing or understanding the Rosetta program.  The included headphone/microphone combo fits comfortably and I forget it's on while going through a lesson. In addition, I've only had a couple times where I had to repeat a phrase because it was so off-base the voice recognition program didn't think it would pass as Italian. Now, granted, this may be because the bar is set really low for how authentically I speak Italian; but I would think that with a program teaching Italian as a second language, it would have to be. For most people, it isn't teaching you how to pass as Italian, it's teaching you how to pass IN Italian. And, if the voice recognition program was too fussy, I would get discouraged and just throw it away.Lessons start out with pronunciation, one syllable at a time, spoken and written.  Then vocabulary, spoken and written. Then phrases.  Total immersion, everything is shown on the screen in Italian and spoken in the program in Italian. Occasionally, you have to type in the answer to a question, rather than say the answer.  Everything is accompanied by photos. So your learning is reinforced in three ways:  you hear the phrase spoken, you see the phrase written, and you see a photo illustrating each phrase (a boy running, boys running).  In later lessons you dive into conversations with full sentences.Your Main Menu shows you which lessons you've completed. Based on that, you can access Rosetta Studio, which is practice with real people. Your main menu will tell you if any Rosetta Studio sessions are available at any point in time. You schedule a session and you and other students take part in a session lead by a native Italian speaker.You get a two-disc CD set for additional practice when you're not on the computer. I have used mine in the car, only occasionally feeling silly for ""talking to myself"". There's no voice recognition, of course. You are only repeating what is said on the CD.  The CD is divided into the same chapters as in the computer program, and each chapter starts with pronunciation, then vocabulary and phrases. Good reinforcement, though, I have to concentrate so hard on what is being said on the CD, that it's a little distracting for driving.If you have an iPhone or another iTouch device, you can download a mini-version of the computer program, including photos. I haven't tried that as my phone is a dinosaur.Included with your program is three months access to Rosetta World OnLine. I haven't tried this yet. From what I understand, after you've completed each chapter on the computer program, you are told how many games, stories and activities are available to you on the OnLine center. You can play individual games, or games with other players (learners) logged in, or with a native Italian speaker. Unfortunately, Rosetta World OnLine is only available 8am - 8 pm for me in Pacific Standard Time zone.  Many times I've sat down at the computer after the kids are in bed, and then it's too late.  If you're in the Eastern U.S., it's available from 11 am to 11 pm. After the three month introductory offer is over, you pay a fee, but I actually can't find what the fee will be.Incidentally, Rosetta Stone offers a six-month unconditional money-back gurantee, but according to their website, you have to order it direct from Rosetta Stone.

I was dubious that any program could motivate this old brain to memorize a language without going into a vegetative state.  As it turns out, Rosetta Stone's program requires little rote memorization. Instead, I found lots of fun and enjoyment in the name of learning.Prior to beginning this program, I never understood how total immersion could be conducive to learning a language. To me total immersion meant total confusion.  While this program is guided immersion, it is not confusing.  Vivid pictures and multiple choice games are entertaining.  It is amusing that the pictures are not just of those who appear European but from a variety of cultures. When learning an Italian word, the picture may be of someone of Asian descent.For each level, there are ways to check yourself and review any content you feel needs review. Using a headset (included), you must pronounce words correctly or you will be given an opportunity to repeat it.  The program even breaks down the word into syllables and a visual (chart) to assist in forming the words correctly.The program is easy to install and allows two people to use it. It remembers where each person left off.A friend or mine loves languages, speaks several and teaches English as a foreign language. She found the program to be excellent in its methods.  In fact, she buys Rosetta Stone to review languages she learned in college to keep it fresh.If I can learn while having fun, anyone can.  Love it! Go for it!",5.0,The Best!!

Nelson,"[88, 98]","Rosetta Stone makes a nicely polished language learning program, with one fairly substantial drawback:  you won't really learn a language.Rosetta's claim is that by learning a language as a child learns (i.e., without translating into another language), you'll internalize the language and eventually be able to think in it, instead of translating on the fly.  This may be true, but it takes children years and years to learn their first language (they're still studying grammar all the way through 8th grade!).  By adopting a child's approach to language learning, Rosetta will leave you lacking in a lot of key areas that other language learning approaches can quickly teach you.If you took any language courses in school, you may remember how much time you spent conjugating irregular verbs and declining nouns.  These tasks may seem like a useless chore, since you can spend months studying and still feel no closer to fluency.  Nevertheless, a good grasp of grammar lays an excellent foundation for language proficiency later.  Children don't learn this way, since there is no simple clip art that can be presented to them to explain the concept of the future plu-perfect conjugation, or the subjunctive mood.  As an adult with (hopefully) a strong grasp on your language of birth, these advanced concepts can be explained to you early on in your study of a second language, so you don't have to spend years and years down the road trying to build a foundation of grammar and syntax underneath a ramshackle house of vocabulary.Rosetta's approach of teaching some elementary vocabulary (boy, girl, runs, walks) and simple relationship words (over, under, next to, etc.) can quickly give you the power to communicate simple concepts in a new language -- which undeniably can be more useful early on than the ability to conjugate the verb ""to be"" in every person, number, mood and tense.  Their choice of vocabulary words for early emphasis won't be particularly helpful to travelers (other language learning systems may teach you more useful traveling vocab, like ""where is the museum"" and ""what time does the train depart""), but they will give you the ability to communicate simply.Nevertheless, the lack of emphasis on grammar and syntax (again, because there is no translation into English, only pictures of things and actions, with deductive reasoning to pick up the slack), you may find yourself sounding to a native speaker a bit like Tarzan ""us will gone statue and picture place"" instead of ""would you like to go with me to the museum?""For the skills that Rosetta stone is trying to teach, the approach is appropriate, and the implementation is very nicely polished (although some of the flashcard-pictures have a weird, taken-in-the-1970s vibe to them).  The approach itself is not enough to teach you a language, and completely ignores the advantages that an adult with a good grasp on their first language can bring to learning a second language.  I think that Rosetta, in combination with a more traditional approach to second-language learning, could be a very powerful combination to help you rapidly internalize vocabulary (with Rosetta), and to lay a good foundation of grammar and syntax.",3.0,Dabbling won't make you fluent,1313539200,"08 17, 2011",Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,0.0

They all seem to follow the same basic structure which I find to be very helpful in acquiring language skills, and in this case, the basics of Italian language.  I've always wanted to know more about the Italian language but am not motivated to try and become fluent.  Level One for me, is just right.  However, if you are wanting to learn Italian in depth please don't just purchase Level One since it only takes you through some basic elementary language skills.No English is spoken, only Italian and I'm given a lot of visual selections from which to choose the action that represents what I'm hearing in Italian.  I seem to do fairly well having both audio AND a visual component to learning a new language.  Also, I like being able to speak my new Italian words into the included microphone and have the program correct my speech mistakes.  I haven't tried the 3 month on-line service where you can speak with a native speaker (tutor), maybe I would if I were trying to learn the language on a deeper level, but for me I'm happy with just the program itself.  After the 3 months are over you have to pay a fee and I don't like paying fees.I feel fairly confident that anyone who applies themselves regularly to any Rosetta Stone language program will learn a lot of the language being studied.  I find it to be a very natural way to learn a language.  Of course it would be best to be totally immersed in the Italian culture to learn it, but for those of us who don't have that option I think Rosetta Stone does a good job as a cultural immersion substitute.",4.0,Rosetta Stone Italian Level 1,1303171200,"04 19, 2011",Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,1.0

This package is certainly unlike any other language learning program I have run across and even with brief usage, has yielded great results.  Although I have no major complaints with the program itself, the price factor did influence my rating.If you have issues with installing the software, I would check to make sure your pc has the latest version of software installed.  For example, Windows XP requires Service Pack 3 for this language software to work properly and Vista needs SP2.  It is easy enough to download the latest service pack with Windows but I hear mac users have more problems.  If you have an older pc, you really need to check the hardware requirements.  Also note that you must have broadband service to access all the features.The box includes a quick start booklet, installation cds, software cds, headset, user agreement booklet, keyboard stickers to convert for Italian usage and online services.  The quick start guide is important to read first and provides support online or by telephone (called about getting it onto my iPhone and received US based help without going through a phone maze).  The software installed easily on Windows 7 as did the included headset via usb port.  The global end user license agreement booklet was printed in microscopic print so I have my fingers crossed it is the usual stuff since I could not find a magnifying glass to read it. The stickers to place over the keyboard to convert it for Italian usage might prove problematic.  I had an extra keyboard that I placed the stickers on and could switch to when using this software.  I don't know if you would want this on your keyboard all the time and peeling it on and off does not seem ideal.  I think you could get away without using the stickers.This software helps with pronunciation (the headset has a microphone), builds vocabulary and phrases, and teaches simple conversation.  The software has 4 lessons in each unit covering: basics (unit 1), greetings and introduction (unit 2), work and school (unit 3) and shopping (unit 4).  Rosetta Stone advertises a learning application for your iPhone or iPod Touch but an account with Rosetta Stone's online services is required. Although the box states it includes free online features, they are free for three months only.  There is a $25 monthly fee  or a $149 fee for 15 months for online services after the trial period.  The 3 month trial starts the moment you activate your online account and you must be at least 13 to create an account.  I strongly suggest you use the software only and then use the online services to get the most out of this software.  The online services are great and allow you to access online tutors, games, and an online community to practice your Italian.  I really liked the options provided online but wished I had activated the free trial after I had gone through the lessons to get more out of it.  It's hard to converse or play simple games when you are just starting to learn Italian.Overall, this is a great tool to learn Italian if you can afford the hefty price tag.  For the same price you might be able to audit an Italian course at a local school but this software is more convenient and provides more personalized service.  Using this language software in tandem with its online services is almost as good as a private tutor at a lower cost.  I don't think I will continue with the online services given this is just a hobby for me but if you urgently needed to learn Italian, this would be worth the price.

Fulkerson,"[2, 2]","I've used other Rosetta Stone language sets before, and I have become an enthusiastic advocate of the series ever since I first popped the discs into my computer.  This series does a very thorough, professional, and entertaining job of introducing concepts, pronunciation, and culture to the user which makes it fun and intuitive to learn.  One aspect that all users of of this series should think of is the considerable amount of money you will save by taking the Rosetta Stone courses over university-taught courses.  I fully endorse the university experience to everyone, but one part of my education that I didn't appreciate was the way my foreign languages were crow-barred into a tight window dictated by the school's curriculum.  I know that time is a factor in all classroom environments, but in my experience, foreign languages are best taught with more time and patience given to the student.  This set really promotes that idea, and manages to have a great deal of social interactivity as well.This program comes with games, live practice sessions, and practical exercises that were actually kind of fun to participate in. I am surprised at the level of immersion a strictly online application is able to achieve. Before I used this product, I felt a set like this would lack social interaction with other native speakers, and learning pronunciations, backgrounds, and some sort of framework as to why a word is pronounced the way it is. A frustrating aspect of any language course at a university is that you are sped (or slowed) along at whatever pace is dictated to your instructor, thus losing some continuity and flow of the learning process. When one is forced to learn a language in a certain time frame it can either cause a lot of stress for those who don't understand concepts, or bore those who feel like they have a good grasp of the material. This set is very useful because you can learn at your own pace, challenge yourself if you feel up to the task, and never get caught in an annoying time schedule. Taking public language courses can be corrupted by rules and regulations, and this set counteracts that notion. Of course, universities have their own versions of online tests and practices, but none are as colorful and vivid as the ones I've experienced in this set. Rosetta Stone has an online community of users that I checked in on several times, and it was filled each time with people waiting to practice and speak with others. The volume of interaction was huge compared to my university experience which is essential in learning a new language.A great deal of production and attention to detail was put into this Rosetta Stone set, and the level of immersion and exercises is not only high, but very enjoyable and interesting. It might be harder to understand how useful this is without ever having taken a university-taught course in language, but I'm now sold. Frankly, I was a little skeptical of how this would work, because learning a new language ultimately needs to be a social experience, and hearing and witnessing native speakers in action is essential in becoming a skilled speaker. However, this set does a fantastic job of capturing that social interaction, and even manages to be a little more exciting in interacting with others via the internet and phone.This is the second foreign language set I've used, and I'm having a good time learning Italian, at my own pace.  It's important that users make a push to learn and to not take too much time in immersing themselves in the concepts with a foreign language, but it's a huge plus to be able to allow oneself to fully grasp an idea before they move on.  Rosetta Stone allows that window to be more flexible, and ultimately clears the way for better and more effective learning.",5.0,Very impressed!,1299715200,"03 10, 2011",Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,1.0

For those who, like me, have never tried it before, here is a brief summary. The software immediately places you into an immersion (sights and sound) environment of still photography and phrases pertaining to the photos. You'll be asked to repeat phrases into the headset, and pronunciation counts (however, it's a great relief to those of us who can't roll our Rs that they allow for that!). You'll also need to type, and click on photos that match what is being said. This specific level attempts to teach basic Italian: colors, greetings and farewells, words that would come up in work and school environments, shopping basics, words for articles of clothing, animals, and the like.My background in learning foreign language is the old-style method of memorization. I would create flashcards of individual words. Repetitive writing by hand was one of the most helpful methods I used to learn--something that's not replicated with Rosetta Stone (though some typing is required). Rosetta Stone, in contrast to the old way of teaching, attempts to teach through immersion. Rather than memorization of one word, a word appears in context in a sentence (or shorter grouping of words), and English translations aren't shown. Rosetta Stone doesn't outright teach in English why a verb is conjugated the way it is, how to (or why you must) match an adjective to a noun, or have you learn specifically how to pronounce vowels and consonants. Instead, the software plunges you into learning by exposure to an all-Italian environment.However, this is exactly why Rosetta Stone may not work for a learner like me. Even though it's fun, it's nevertheless frustrating. I want to know how the words relate to my native language. While using the product, I can't help trying to translate everything into English and trying to understand why the grammar is the way it is. And because it's software, I can't go at my own pace. In high school and college, I would read forward to the next unit if I got ahead of my peers, and remove flashcards of words that needed concentrating on.Not knowing the rules of grammar can be frustrating to someone who learns the way I do. The software seems to be geared more toward those who learn visually. For anyone who has not already tried to learn a foreign language, or has found the old-style memorization method doesn't work for them, I would recommend trying Rosetta Stone. For those like me who have done very well with the old method, you may find it difficult to adapt to an immersion environment.",3.0,"""A"" way to learn, but not necessarily ""the"" way",1299196800,"03 4, 2011",Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,0.0

I truly feel that if i keep at it with lessons i will be able to master this language within 4 years. That's about the time i have heard other people who have mastered the language say it took them in classes. I love the program and will be getting Italian next. Although, i already know broken and limited Italian as well. The Italian will be easier for me to learn i suspect. Its just a easier language to learn compared to Japanese. With how much Japanese i learned with the program in just 2 days of lessons, i suspect that i will master Italian in about 2 years. It's a good program and i am very happy with it. This method may not be for everyone. I am more of a visual learner and have photographic memory so maybe that is why i was able to pick up so much in just 2 days. To Visual learner's YES i do recommend this program.I do each lesson 5 times a day. I am already on core lesson 2. My ending score for core lesson 1 is about 98% in 2 days.

In my experience, it is good for practice if you already know the material being covered. Learning from it as a sole resource is unreasonable. They simply don't spend enough time drilling vocabulary and there is pretty much no grammar being taught.Problem with Rosetta Stone is that they don't explicitly tell you anything in your native language.  Instead, they expect you to infer meanings and make your own connections. The problem with this is that the user will probably end up making the incorrect associations without a parent or teacher to correct them.  Many of the pictures (from which you are expected to derive fairly complex concepts at times) are overly ambiguous.  However, if you already know the language, the pictures can make sense... most of the time.If you are already studying Japanese and you simply need something to help you with listening comprehension, then that is pretty much all this is good for... and really, it isn't great for that.  For the price, you are much better off looking elsewhere.  The websites iKnow.jp, TextFugu.com, and Skritter.com come to mind.

The Japanese tool provides some basics but has much room for improvement. The same difficulties exist with both.(1) The milestones frustrate learners greatly. Only a SINGULAR programmed response is acceptable; there is far too little information to discern it exactly (or even guess something close sometime); and as unacceptable responses mount negativity towards the product grows. This terrible feature (Milestone) should be eliminated or vastly improved.(2) The allowable pronunciation of some runes (boht Japanese and SPanish) is VERY tight, while it is quite loose on others. It is irritating & frustrating. The pronunciation aid screen provides additional insight, but there are a few letters I cannot produce acceptably. In Japanese Shi, Chi, and Sa are far too tight. The use should be able to LOOSEN these.(2a) Even after I produce an acceptable pronunciation, later in the lesson it is rejected. A HUMAN is needed to explain and help. The COMPUTER only defeats the learner's enthusiasm.(2b) In longer words and sentences, the same mispronunciation of the same runes is allowed. The program is inconsistent.(2c) What are you trying to teach? Can a native speaker understand the learner? If so, let it pass - even for single runes.(3) The estimated time for each lesson is FAR too low. To think, read the strange new Japanese runes, pronounce the words (acceptably), and try to impress them into memory requires effort.(4) When new words are introduced through a group of pictures, the learner islimited to SIGHT only. FOUR of the FIVE other senses are NOT ENGAGED. This is NOT AS ADVERTISED ""learning the way you learned your first language.""(5) Because of this, a collection of pictures (for example family members) should NOT be used to INTRODUCE new words. The method of sound plus 2 pictures then choice of 3 pictures, followed by one picture with audio and a choice of three, followed by audio and the same choice of three is FAR BETTER. At least it involves TWO SENSES.(6) A collection of 4 or more pictures should be programmed to keep the ""NOT"" choice until later among the choices. When the FIRST choice is ""The person is not a DOCTOR"" and there are 4 pictures, one of which is a doctor, it is difficult to pick out the correct picture. You may think you've given enough clues, but it is NOT a positive experience for the learner who is unsure what the word for doctor is.(7) I tried to return to UNIT 1 after the MILESTONE and the program does not allow it. You need a REVIEW OPTION.(7a) On my demand, I want to see pictures of NOUNS, their spelling, and AUDIO. When I learned my original language, I could do that via human interaction or media.(7b) On demand I want to see verbs also.(7c) I want to be able to get a definition, even if its only in Japanese using words I've already supposedly learned, on demand. For example, FUTARI. Eventually I had to ask a native speaker what it meant.

I can't say all of this was from Rosetta Stone, though. I thought Rosetta Stone was pretty good, but I don't think I could call it a standalone resource to learn Japanese. A major part of learning Japanese is mastering the katakana, hiragana, and kanji, and Rosetta Stone is definitely not the best way to do that. There's a section of the program that teaches katakana and hiragana, but I feel that Rosetta Stone has a pretty inefficient way of teaching the alphabet.I really liked Rosetta Stone's voice recognition. Not many other programs offer that. I had to turn up the speech precision difficulty though because I thought it was being too lenient on pronunciation. I definitely did not like the milestones at the end of each unit, which expect the user to speak his/her way through a ""real life"" situation. The problem is that even though language is dynamic and diverse, Rosetta Stone says there's a single specific response for everything, and it's not easy at all to guess this from the context.Rosetta Stone was great for teaching vocabulary, and I've retained most of what I've learned from it. To fill the shortcomings of Rosetta Stone, I've been using some other resources which I'll list here.Human Japanese: For the money, this teaches much more than Rosetta Stone can. It covers the alphabet, grammar, vocabulary, and cultural notes and it's a really interesting read.GENKI I: An Integrated Course in Elementary Japanese [With CDROM] (Japanese Edition) (English and Japanese Edition): I'm only a few chapters into Genki, but it's known as one of the best ""real"" textbooks for self study.Remembering the Kana: A Guide to Reading and Writing the Japanese Syllabaries in 3 Hours Each (part 1) (Japanese Edition): Dr. Heisig's Remembering the Kana was the quickest, most efficient way I could find to learn the kana.Remembering the Kanji: A Complete Course on How Not to Forget the Meaning and Writing of Japanese Characters: Heisig's Remembering the Kanji has taught me several hundred kanji so far, and I still remember the ones I learned almost a year ago.I liked Rosetta Stone a lot, but it's too expensive for what it gives.

For example, when you are trying to indicate that an item is in front of another item you really need to know what the perspective is.  Is it from my perspective or from the item's perspective?  Without a teacher, native speaker or some kind of reference material, this is only possible through a leap of intuition.

I asked the girl behind the counter about the apparent contradiction and she confirmed that 'yomu' is the proper verb.  I later learned that 'yonde' means 'to call'.  So I was learning ""to call a book""?!  Needless to say, I was very disappointed not just in learning the wrong word but in now not knowing if I learned others wrong too.The final straw was when I went to Rosetta Stone and found that there was no option to upgrade without re-purchasing the software.  For the price of this software, a user should be paying to learn the language, not just buying a couple of CDs.  At the least I expected a trade-in program at just the price of shipping.  So, overall, not a positive experience.On a side note, I did the free version of Human Japanese for smart phone and quite enjoyed it.

{'$oid': '5a132293741a2384e8376f3f'},A3MHGA6BJJ7P27,1617160377,"W. T. Hoffman ""artist and musician""","[9, 10]","ROSETTA STONE is famous for teaching language the way little children learn language...naturally, quickly, without studying verb declention charts, memorizing vocabulary lists, or navagating grammatical oddities. However, there is an obvious problem with this philosophy that ROSETTA STONE has based their teaching method upon. The people who buy and learn from ROSETTA STONE are NOT 3-5 year old children. Any Linguist will tell you, children are hard wired to learn grammer, and to speak perfectly their native language. As we age, the ability to speak certain sounds disappears, and the ability to learn certain types of grammer also disappears. Once a child is past that stage of absorbing grammerical rules naturally, or pronouncing certain native sounds, the door shuts. You can still learn, but not perfectly. This is why a russian who learns english, will NEVER understand exactly how to use definative articles. Also, this is why Russian constanant clusters are impossible to pronounce for English speakers. There are almost NO exceptions to this, except for language savants i suppose.However, as far as learning language in a natural way, on your own, ROSETTA STONE is the best you can do. As anyone knows who's studied foreign languages in high school or college, you start with learning to pronounce the alphabet. Then, you learn the most common words, along with the way basic verbs (TO BE, TO HAVE, TO KNOW, etc) are conjugated, how the nouns and adjectives interact, etc. ROSETTA STONE turns that learning process on its head, and the center of its do-it-yourself language class, is the SPEACH RECOGNITION system. The RS Kit comes with alphabet letters for your computer keyboard (in case your target language has a different alphabet, than the English alphabet), and the computer files, plus four CDs to pracitice pronounciation when away from the computer. Also, the buyer recieves in the box, this headset w/microphone that plugs into the USB port of your computer.(plus a few simple instructions to get started.) Unlike the oldest voice recognition programs from a decade ago, this headset just sets the volumn level, and you are ready to go. Instead of learning to pronounce the alphabet, you just learn to speak the first words a baby might speak...""cat, run, read, boy, girl, hello, 1,2,3,4,5,6"", stuff like that. Rosetta Stone assumes you will learn the pronounciation rules automatically, ""BY EAR"". First, not everybody CAN learn strickly by ear. Some musicians can hear a song, and they KNOW every chord they heard, and the notes, and can reproduce them instantly, because they can PLAY MUSIC BY EAR. Other musicians need to learn what notes belong where on the instrument, and they need sheet music, and chord theory. WHY? Because some people are more right brain, others more left brain...maybe some people HEAR better, and others analyse better. So, if you are trying to pronounce the Italian word ""ZIA"" (Aunt), you will never GUESS it should sound like TSEE-ah. When English speakers see a ""Z"", they will not pronouce ""TS"", as in German, Russian, Italian, etc. SINCE ROSETTA STONE DOESNT TELL YOU WHAT THE ITALIAN ""Z"" OUGHT TO SOUND LIKE, you need to guess. THis is when the ROSETTA STONE voice recognition just doesnt work. You might hear TSEE-a, but if you see ""ZIA"", your brain will think it's hearing what it's used to hearing--""ZEE-ah"", and that's what you will say. AND, the voice recognistion WONT recognise the correct pronounciation. Likewise, Italian has other sounds not at all like English, and unless you have some kind of heads up on how each letter SHOULD sound, you may never get close to the correct sound. I have a good ear. But i couldn't hear that Italian has a more dental sounding ""D"" than english. I didnt know the other oddities associated with pronouncing the Italian language. At times, I would click on LANGUAGE LAB, where you get directed to a page that SLOWS DOWN the pronounciation of the word, as well as showing you the voice print, and how the native speaker's voice rises and falls naturally, during the pronounciation of the word. (Apparently for correct stress.) If you are 50% or less away from getting it right, you see a brown cirle that tells you about how close you are, to correct pronounciation. (Plus the system records your attempt at pronouncing the word, so you can compair what you are saying, to that of a native speaker.) If your circle turns green, you are 80% or closer to perfect pronounciation. HOWEVER, this system DOES NOT ALWAYS WORK. Once, i tried to pronounce ARRIVIDERCI for 15 minutes. I was UPSET, then angry, then bored, and finally, dejected. Frustration kills motivation, and I think that's why problems with the voice recognition bothers so many people. IF i knew what was wrong with my pronounciation, at least i could TRY to figure out how to say it. I think this happens to EVERYBODY who uses Rosetta Stone at some point. The computer program doesnt say ""The Italian 'G' is PRONOUNCED HARDER THAN ENGLISH 'G'."" Instead, you are suppose to just KNOW this.  Sometimes, i just believe the voice recognition is just not able to read normal variations in pronounciation correctly. For example, ROSETTA STONE wants you to roll your R's. But, very few people even in Italy can actually make that sound. So then the voice recognistion hears the lack of rolling R's as a mistake in pronounciation. The computer program considers these mistakes as WRONG on your part, and at times the mistakes start to stack up. IF you dont get thru a lesson with a good score, you'll need to repeat the lesson, and also repeat the offending word. (the program tracks a LOT of parameters, including how long its been since you have taken a lesson. Too long, and RS makes you review things before you can start the lessons again. But that's good.) All I can say, is when I could not pronounce a certain word, i almost never knew why. Even tho ROSETTA STONE gives you 4 CDs for pronounciation practice, if you've an inability to say a certain word, you might not ever speak it correctly.My other problem, was that there is NOTHING in the kit, that explains GRAMMER the way you learnt grammer in school. Sometimes, those photos that go with the spoken or written exercise, dont get the idea across very well. THE ONLY SOLLUTION, is to buy some kind of cheap TEACH YOURSELF ITALIAN paperback book, that covers basics of grammer, pronounciation, vocabulary, and all the other holes in the learning of the language, that ROSETTA STONES leaves untouced. AMAZON.COM sells a pretty good book, very cheap, that would help anyone using their ROSETTA STONE class immensely. ""ITALIAN MADE SIMPLE"" by Cristina Mazzoni, for around $8 new. I bought that book, and only then, were the grammer lessons beginning to make sense. ALSO, this book spends time in the beginning, to teach the differences between the way OUR alphabet is pronounced, and the way the Italian Alphabet is pronounced. You NEED to get a book like this, so you understand italian grammer, and have a little bit of an Italian dictionary as well.There are a few other problems with ROSETTA STONE. Everybody says ""DONT SIGN UP FOR LANGUAGE LAB, UNTIL YOU GET THRU THE LANGUAGE BASICS"". Because, depending on how fast, or slow, you are motivated to move thru the lessons, those 3 months of FREE LANGUAGE LAB go by really fast. WAIT TO SIGN UP! ALSO, its good to know that you cant just sign up for language lab a day or two before you want to use it. THERE IS A TWO WEEK WAIT, to have a lesson. Besides the speach recognition problem, and the lack of a good text book so you can learn grammer, pronounciation and vocabulary the way adults learn language, everything about ROSETTA STONE's classes are LOTS OF FUN. Really. They have games that help you keep those new words constantly in your mind. There are stories that help with reading, that are clued into your number of finished lessons. ITALIAN LEVEL ONE, for example, is divided into UNIT ONE, language basics, UNIT TWO, Greetings, UNIT THREE, Work and school, UNIT FOUR, shopping. By the time you finish that much of the course, you should be able to get around Italy, and make basic conversation. I would guess your proficiency level might be FIRST YEAR COLLEGE ITALIAN, or two years of high school italian, or 1-2 Italian grandparents. ROSETTA STONE is very visually interesting, and will keep you motivated once you get past that first unit (language basics), so long as you dont have major problems being understood by the voice recognition software. I wish i had waited for the langauge lab, because i'm SURE that would have helped. However, if you don't use it as much as you want after the first 3 months, its only $25 a month, for more time with those online tutors. All things considered, VOICE RECOGNITION really DOES work remarkably well. I'm sure most of the problems people have, come from their inablity to pronouce certain sounds specific to their target language, rather than the program's inability to understand your voice. If you are speaking the language correctly, I would guess anywhere from 96-99% of the time, ROSETTA STONE understands EXACTLY what you say. If some word (like my problem with ARRIVIDERCI) comes up, you can easily skip the word. There is NO OTHER SELF TAUGHT LANGUAGE CLASS that can perfect your speach, increase your vocabulary, and engage you in an ""immersion"" type language adventure, like ROSETTA STONE can.  NO OTHER SYSTEM has the native speaker 1 on 1 language lab. The only REAL problem is if you learn on your own, its hard to keep your motivation for learning high. You'll need discipline and some kind of reward, ie, a trip to Italy if you finish LEVEL 1? (Or maybe just a FELLINI film. Whatever rocks your boat.)

Having said that, my preferences lean towards product that aid in increasing my confidence in speaking, reading, writing, and understanding. Generally, these programs have clear audio, pictures, simple grammar lessons, and clear breakdowns of phonetic structures for non-native speakers (being entertaining and cheap is always a plus!)Rosetta Stone is a wonderful vocabulary builder. The pictures and audio help store new words in long-term memory. The games *can* be fun and the lessons test listening skills and adaptive recall. With purchase, a user gains access to online tutoring sessions with a native speaker after completing chapter units (to try out their new skills.) Listening to the natural rhythm of native speakers in the program helps reduce accent and familiarize a user with the new language. There is a lot of content in level 1 of Japanese alone, which is broken into 4 units: Language Basics, Greeting/Introductions, Work/School, and Shopping. Each lesson builds on the last, helping the user retain vocabulary previously studied (but sadly, nearly prohibiting skipping ahead).Unfortunately, there are some major flaws:This isn't the fastest self-taught curriculum; you won't learn useful, everyday phrases right away. Sure, I understand ""The cat is sleeping."" Or, ""The boy runs."" That's good, but how am I to realistically apply this to practical conversation? It took hours of lessons to learn phrases like ""goodnight,"" or ""Where is the bathroom?""Grammar is never fully broken down. Users are left guessing how or why sentence structure or the Japanese particle system works (if they can even figure out what that is). Vocabulary, even with the pictures, is also vague at times. A child learning a new language uses a lot of guess work and is constantly corrected by parents in the early stages of language development. An adult, however, shouldn't need to make nearly as many mistakes as a babbling toddler, let alone without being constantly corrected. When confused about a word or phrase meaning, there is no direct translation available through Rosetta Stone itself- ever. I shouldn't need to use Google Translate to understand what I'm learning. It can be frustrating for absolute beginners. The phrases, when repeated listen for accuracy in the user's speech. However, one must only be about 80% correct for a sentence to register as right. I tested by saying and omitting words at times, and skimmed through the lesson with few problems. It's not that it's not okay to make mistake while learning, but proceed with caution. The words pop up as the user speaks them. Parts of a sentence that do not register as clear will appear in a more faded font. There were times when I spoke correctly, and still read faded font, second-guessing myself. (Though my sensei confirmed I was correct!)Lastly, despite having lots of content, the lessons can be insanely repetitive and even confusing at times. It's easy for beginners to get disheartened, or think that language isn't their niche due to a poor start with the wrong learning materials. Conversational Japanese is actually the easiest self-taught language I've studied, with consistent sentence structures and easily approachable sounds for native English and Spanish speakers.I used Rosetta Stone as a vocabulary builder along with my college JPN 103 class. I got what I paid for: increased confidence, greater fluency, and larger vocabulary. The catch is that I already mostly understood what and why words were ordered in each set. I recommend Rosetta Stone for people with some basic knowledge of Japanese language looking to build on what they already know, but definitely not for a novice. For the money, I can see how this would be an overwhelming frustrating disappointment. Invest in something with audio and a simple grammar book, some hiragana/katakana workbooks, and flashcards.

Well, I was not learning Korean with it despite hundreds of hours with it [I only stuck with it because I had spent so much money and knew of no available alternative at that time].  The pictures were ambiguous and in a few classes unclear [I am not used to seeing a horse's head up so close that I can't recognize it. There is a picture showing a leg and a foot -- which one is meant?  What is being said with the guy falling off in the rodeo or the guy on the skateboard?].  It took me a long time to figure out the prepositions of place without any explanation.The program also doesn't allow for the fact that there are not one-to-one mappings from ""observation"" to a target language for  all prepositions of place [think of the diverse uses of the English preposition of place ""on""]. In Korean, the words for red and blue have a contrasting initial consonant, that I cannot hear in the program, but the second consonant, though written the same, sounds distinctly different to me.  Maybe these are allophones, maybe not:  But RS is no help here.I worked HARD on this program.  It was one of the most frustrating experiences in my life.  In fact, I got to the point where I knew all the answers but still had no idea what I was saying in 10~20% of them.  The review system seemed faulty:  I would be tested again and again on words and phrases I already knew and got correct -- and not get out of the loop.  This is NOT how I learned my first language.  [Besides that, as an adult, I don't expect, and research does not indicate, that I will learn L1 and L2.]  Here are two places where some guidance would have been helpful:1] Korean has two systems for counting, pure Korean and Sino-Korean.  There are specific applications for each, e.g., for how much something costs versus how things are being bought.  RS teaches one set of numbers, but then times are taught, with-out any explanation that the numbers just learned are simply a different system than what applies to the hours of the day.  2] Korean only uses plural markers and subjects when they are not clear from the context.  But RS seems to be ignorant of this, very early on make a big to-do [as I would if I were teaching English, German or Spanish, for example] of the difference between 'banana' and 'bananas.'  This certainly did not help me when I got to Korea and tried to buy things!The speakers speak rapidly.  This is a natural speed for Seoul natives.

As a linguist and ESL teacher, I know the limitations of such programs, compared to taking a course or making friends with a speaker of the other language.The best use of Rosetta Stone is for visual learners to pick up basic vocabulary. Even if there were a RS 2 or 3 for Korean, which there isn't, it still wouldn't help you much beyond that. A picture dictionary provides the same benefit, though. It would have far more words than RS does, for $90 cheaper, and it'd be easier to carry around. Plus you could add related words in the margins! Get one with a CD, so you can mimic the pronunciation.The language quality for Rosetta Stone products is hit or miss. For languages such as Spanish or French, the language is perfect. For Korean or Hindi, though, RS products stink. They're full of language errors! Language learners won't know that they're learning bad Arabic or Korean, until they finally make a friend from that culture. By that time, they don't need RS anymore. You'd think their quality control would be much better.There's also an issue with poor service. Years ago, I misplaced my disk 1. This was years ago. RS wants to charge me an exorbitant amount to replace that disk, even though I still have disk 2, so obviously I'm not trying to scam them.

Levels 1-3 will give you a good foundation in the language and probably some fairly good speaking skills - but you will still have a ways to go. Also, sadly, you will not have developed very much conversational skills after this first level. You will learn some ""need-to-know"" stuff, yes, but stuff that you will most likely not use very much. There are sentences like ""The cat is in the hat"" and ""The keys are in the shoe"". I understand the reasoning behind forming sentences like this (prepositions and the prepositional case), but you would think that more focus would be paid on actual conversational skills.Another gripe is that the images are not unique to the language. You would think that if you pay over $200 bucks for one level (and over $500 for all three) that you would be getting something unique. Having said that, there is a wide range of different Russian speakers throughout level one - all very pleasant and easy to understand.The online features are absolutely great. This is one reason why it's earned four stars from me. I honestly think Rosetta Stone could really make some money if they separated the software and their online stuff.So, to sum everything up: this is a good, addictive, and interactive product; but it definitely shouldn't be your only resource. Buy some books to understand some of the grammar, and try to get yourself a dictionary or always have Google Translate handy and ready to go. Also, try to hook up with some native speakers via Skype or something, especially if you want to learn some real conversational skills.

I would recommend learning at least the alphabet before starting, as that definitely helps the program make more sense. This actually comes with an alphabet guide, but you should probably use another source to learn it. Also, learning some grammar before starting could be of much use. I remember having absolutely no idea which choice to make on many of the grammar questions early on. This is alright, however, as you'll end up figuring it out mostly by using Rosetta Stone.As I'm an absolute beginner, I did like that Rosetta Stone just starts off with vocabulary. It gives a good feel for the pronunciation of words and other basic concepts. I must admit, though, that it was pretty scary to start the very beginning lesson with a near impossible-to-pronounce word, devushka (""girl"" in the English alphabet). Aside from that, the program starts off nicely with vocab, and progresses to grammar and some basic conversation. It becomes even more complex once each core lesson (and then unit) is mastered. The ""standard"" course is perfect for learning the language overall, although there are different courses that can specifically focus on speaking, reading, or writing. There are also standard courses with different introductions, extended courses, and placement tests.Some people may not like Rosetta Stone's style of full immersion.

The concept behind Rosetta Stone is based on the observation that children can induce the grammar of their mother tongue from examples in which the specific functions of linguistic units are contrasted.  As Rosetta Stone would have it, since children learn effortlessly this way, then why not adults?The problem is that children require millions of impressions to induce the grammar.  Also, when mature humans learn a second language, the syntax of the first language interferes with the notions one constructs of the second.  It's therefore highly inefficient to teach language this way.  With adults it's actually much more efficient to be more explicit about the grammar of the target language -- to provide clear descriptions of the rules accompanied by many examples and much practice.  Immersion can be very useful, but not to the exclusion of explicit instruction in the rules of the language.  I found myself playing a tortured game of 'find waldo', trying to figure out, say, is X the feminine form of some plural article?  One ends up learning a few wooden formulae, but not learning the structure of the language.Aside from this, I found the software implementation to be very weak.  The whole activation mechanism is painful.  If you switch computers or re-install the OS on a machine, you have to go through a tortured process with Rosetta Stone support to obtain a working activation code.  Versions 3 and 4 failed to co-exist on my Win7 x64 system.  When I tried to use V3, an installer was kicked off which quickly failed, after which neither Version 3 nor 4 worked, and I had to reinstall both -- which required the laborious process of obtaining new activation codes (for some reason).

I am very well familiar with pronounciation of vowels and dipthongs not normally found in my native tongue.That having been said, I find the Rosetta Stone software's ability to rate my speech as extremely poor.  It often refuses to recognize my voice pronouncing words (and even single syllables).  Moreover, when I repeat a word or phrase into the microphone, it often does not recognize that I have stopped speaking, and the software simply sits there doing nothing. If it were human it would be wearing an idiot's grin.  I am not exaggerating when I say that I repeat a one-syllable word and the program sometimes takes up to 20 seconds to acknowledge it (whether I pronounced the word correctly or not is immaterial). Note that I am using a state-of-the-art PC, so hardware isn't the issue.Furthermore, the Rosetta Stone ""immersion"" approach to language learning is not good for anyone who has learned a second or third language through formal lessons.  The software is designed to NOT take your native tongue into account, but the only benefit of that is to Rosetta Stone, NOT the learner.  Many languages have sets of rules regarding gender agreement or unorthodox pronounciation; most languages have regular rules about conjugation.  RS imparts NONE of these rules; doing so would require an explanation in every native tongue.  Instead, you are left to figure it out on your own. This seriously impedes the process.  What this product will do is teach you to speak BAD Swedish.In short, if this is your first attempt at learning a non-native language, it might work for you.

Rosetta Stone claims to design their software based on the idea that you can learn a second language the way you learned your first one, through so-called immersion. First of all, using Rosetta Stone hardly qualifies as immersion. Secondly, anyone who has studied second language acquisition knows that adults do not and should not learn language as if they were children. It may sound easy because most of us don't remember much about learning our first language, but if you think about it from a common-sense perspective you will realize that even a ten-year old native speaking child still makes many errors. Do you want to spend ten years trying to learn a second language? Second language acquisition programs should take into account the fact that adults have many more language and cognitive skills that they can employ in their language study than children do. A well-developed program would account for this and use this to the learner's advantage. Rosetta Stone does not do this.From a motivational standpoint it is also a very discouraging program. As others have said, it doesn't teach you how to communicate. Pimsleur's audio programs, while still limited in some ways, have the advantage of teaching you language that allows for immediate conversation (or immediate conversation with people you don't know well.) I found it very encouraging that I was able to use the Turkish I learned in my first lesson to strike up a conversation with a Turkish man I met at an international dinner at my university. All I did was asking him if he was a Turk and respond that no, I am American when he asked me if I was Turkish. (You can imagine how please I was to be asked.) But with Rosetta Stone you won't be able to do this. You'll be able to say hello and then point to the people at another table and make the astute observation that they are eating a meal.It is unfortunate that the program is not more useful because resources for Turkish study are quite limited. But until Rosetta Stone learns to incorporate some conversational skills and sound SLA theory into their programs I would suggest avoiding them unless you have money to burn.",1.0,Poor Pedagogy,1296259200,"01 29, 2011",Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,0.0

However, there are 2 problems that have come to my attention early on which made me want to review this before completing the course. First, since the program is a full emersion program, while I am picking up on words and associations, I often find myself not understanding the entire phrase of what is being said. I wish there was an option to show the statements in English to just confirm what I thought was just shown to me.The other problem, however, I find worse. The microphone that comes with the program is terrible. First off, unless I'm doing something wrong the headset speakers doesn't work. All my sound came out of my computer speakers. Even more frustrating is that the mic rarely picks up what I am saying. I find myself saying phrases and words several times before the program acknowledges it. Then, it often doesn't register exactly what I said. I know Vietnamese is a tonal language, but I say the same thing without changing the pronunciation multiple times before the program says I'm correct. If I was pronouncing it wrong, then it should never say I did it correctly. If you're getting this program and your computer doesn't have a built in mic, I'd recommend buying one outside what comes in the box.In all, the program is great and I'm already starting to feel confident speaking to my girlfriend's family (who are Vietnamese) but I am not completely confident to carry entire conversations.

Since they offered a trial or demo disk, I ordered a disk and tried it.  It seemed good and I liked all the improvements over version 2.  So I decided to buy the the program.  To Rosetta Stone's credit, this version is a giant step forward in interaction and variation of teaching methods to keep the Vietnamese student involved and interested.  The package includes a headphone & microphone set so you can speak the words you hear, and the computer will let you know if you're pronouncing the words and phrases correctly.  In fact, you can set the program's tolerance level of your pronounciation.  This new version also allows you to type in the words and phrases your hear, thereby helping you to learn how to spell the new language you are speaking.Unfortunately, in spite of all these new improvements, there were two problems (serious problems in my evaluation) that made me return the program for a refund.  The first problem was pronounciation.  Vietnamese is a tonal language; in fact, it has 6 different tones.  Also, there is a significant difference between the North Vietnamese dialect and the South Vietnamese dialect.  This program proportedly teaches the northern dialect, but the pronounciation is not correct.  In version 2, the pronounciation was textbook perfect; each tone was distinct and precise.  In version 4, they've gotten sloppy.  Specifically the high-rising tone used in some words (like con cho' [= dog], con ga'i [= girl], etc.) is pronounced  with a falling, rising tone (like pha?i [= yes] or ho?i [= question].  My wife, who is Vietnamese, confirmed these mispronounciations.The other problem is the method used to type in Vietnamese words.  When Vietnamese people type proper Vietnamese with tone marks, they usually use one of two methods: VIQR and VNI. (Look up these methods on the internet.)  But, Rosetta Stone doesn't use either of these common methods; instead have come up with their own method.  Unfortunately, it is very cumbersome and painfully slow.So, because of these 2 serious problems, I can't fully reccommend this program.  There are many other programs available that teach Vietnamese.  One I CAN recommend is called ""A Little Vietnamese"" by Griesser Software.  This program is unique in that it teaches both North and South Vietnamese dialects and the differences between them.  Unfortunately, it does not work on Macintosh computers, unless you have a Windows-simulator program (like Virtual PC or Parallels).

I collect knitting books and there are not many amongst the recent onslaught of books that I find add anything to the science and art of knitting.  Nicky's books do.  All of them in general and this one in particular are fantastic.  She has a style and sense of color that is inspiring.  Note: not all of the designs are new.  I believe that at least one was in an issue of Vogue Knitting in the mid 90's.  I do not consider that a minus.

I see lots of Nicky Epstein's work style here. A great deal of color work, some delicate and some brighter. Some texture. In all quite a bit of variety, with great production values for the book itself.I would not recommend this for the beginner, unless you are really adventurous, or planning ahead to be an expert. There is little here to start off a new knitter safely. I would gather some good basic techniques and ensure that you don't have lots of bad habits first, before trying to tackle most of these.Some of the colorwork that looks really intimidating is simply duplicate stitch, so it's not nearly so difficult to  produce, but has impressive results. There are a couple of afghans here that would give me pause before tackling them, and I LIKE a challenge, so be warned.However, I think this is a fine book if you don't have lots of her other work in your collection. I had never seen any of these before, so I'm really pleased.I would caveat, though, that in my experience of working with her patterns before, to be really alert for what is on your needles v what is in the pattern. If in doubt, go with your needles. Also, I have nearly always found that she seems to prefer a much lighter fabric than I do, so I gauge down by at least 2 sizes, sometimes 3.

It has a hard black case and tough resin band for durability like the Casio G-Shock.  I have owned a series of G Shocks over the past twenty years and I believe they are the best activity watches made at an affordable price.  I love this Titanium Pathfinder because it does so many things well and has an equally impressive appearance. The Titanium Pathfinder functions in a very similar manner to my original one, with some additional timers for yacht racing.  The main reason I bought this watch was my desire to own a good quality all metal Triple Sensor Pathfinder.  I was stunned to find this one on Amazon and at a price which was lower than I paid for the first one.  I became immediately interested because the components (case and wristband) are Titanium.  Titanium is the hottest metal going for all types of consumer goods including watches and appliances (like my refrigerator).  Another new feature for me was the solar powered movement.  My only disappointment is that it doesn't include atomic timekeeping; however the error tolerance (+ or - 15 seconds/month) is the same for the atomic Pathfinder and the solar Pathfinder.  I believe Casio now makes a solar powered atomic Pathfinder but it is considerably more expensive.  It appears that this model is being discontinued so you need to act quickly.

Some reviews listed under this item are about different Pathfinder Protrek watches without the analog hands which I never seriously considered.  Analog dials have a great advantage - you can take a split-second glimpse and still know what time it is, and combined with digital dials they give you an abundance of available readings.  I have been looking for and buying only ana-digi watches like this because of their functionality and flexibility.The greatest selling point of this watch is the perfect combination of features that I am always looking for (listed in order of importance):- Analog-digital multi-function watch- Solar- Shock-resistant- Compass- Barometer- AltimeterSo far, I have been very proudly using this watch every day for two and a half years and it is still my #1 functionality-features watch in the world.  Although it's not listed as anti-shock but as ""Tough Solar"" it really is a very tough engineering work of art.  It still works perfectly even though it has gone through a significant number of abusing events.  Besides the annual vacation swims/dives in the sea and everyday normal movements, I'm an ex professional drummer who still frequently pats his knees in the rhythm of the music, and nowadays this watch has to withstand frequent clapping when listening to the music and playig with my daughter.  In addition, my 1.5 year old daughter used to play with it occasionally and she let it fall on the floor many times.  Moreover, this watch has two times received a hit that would have broken apart any other watch I have.  Once I accidentally hit a corner of a rock wall with it so hard that my hand hurt.  In spite of my expectations, all those abuses have only left a single barely visible scratch in the middle of the glass and several minor scratches on the bezel, so I can testify that the crystal/glass on it is very scratch resistant and the watch really is very tough.  I bought the titanium model/bracelet, so the entire watch is very light in spite of its size.The solar charging works great and the battery is almost always on H (high) position, and only in December during long nights and short days it sometimes goes to M (medium) and the contributing factor might be that I have the automatic backlight set up and it frequently lights up even when I don't need it.  When I get the M reading I can quickly charge the watch if I leave it in the window for half an hour during a sunny day because in the winter it is often covered with my sleeve when I'm outside.  Usually, instead of charging I like to push the envelope and see whether I can get it to L (low), but I've never seen that so far. At night and during prolonged low light conditions, the watch shuts off its digital displays to save power, but once you move the watch (or turn the backlight on), they turn on automatically and instantaneously.Some people complain about inaccurate temperature readings on watches like this, but you have to be aware that there is no way your watch will not get influenced by your body temperature, so you need to take it off and leave it for several minutes before you can get an accurate reading.  The only exception is when you are swimming/diving and you can obtain a reasonably accurate measurement of the water temperature in a matter of minutes without taking the watch off, especially if you are moving your arms and swimming or if water is otherwise flowing around the watch.The barometer/altimeter is accurate (of course, if you adjust it prior to your trip to a known reference point).  I always watch it on the airplane where you can tell which passenger plane keeps the air pressure best (or also which company is trying to save and scrape on air supplies and maintain low pressure)  - sometime you'll see the pressure drop about 33% before they adjust it and so the reading of the altimeter in a pressurized plane cabin is not at all accurate.  The internal artificial pressure they keep in the passenger cabin usually corresponds to 4000-6500 feet above the sea level.The compass function works well, but I think they should have allowed it to work for a longer and possibly adjustable period of time before shutting itself off automatically after 20 seconds.  I know it takes a considerable amount of battery power to run the compass but still, I'd like to have the option to run it for 30 seconds or a minute without having to press the button repeatedly.There is more I'd like to see and buy in a better watch and I have been looking for it for years, but I still haven't seen one as good as this.The only two main competitors I considered for a while were Tissot's T-Touch and Citizen's Eco-Drive Skyhawk.  The T-Touch watch, as seen in the James Bond movie is a bit less bulky and more dressy, so it looks better, but you have to spend about double the amount on it.  Still, if it were solar I wouldn't hesitate to buy it, but since it's not, in my referent system that translates to a waste of time and money when the battery runs out and a questionable water resistance after replacement, so it's out of the question.  Citizen's similar solar bulky watch Eco-Drive Skyhawk is a bit more dressy, but its digital and analog dials are not independent and from some reviews I can also conclude that it's definitely not as tough and resistant as this one.  Omega had an amazing ana-digi multi-function Speedmaster X-33 watch that was a serious candidate for my favorite, however, that one was not solar powered, it was many times more expensive, and it is not being made any more, so Casio's PRG60T-7V still owns the ""THE WATCH"" title in my world.Some minor cons:- I'm 6'3"" and not skinny, and although together with the titanium bracelet it does have a rugged sturdy look, I'd like it to be a bit smaller, and definitely thinner.- Position of start/stop/reset buttons on the stop watch function is unusual.  The lower right button is used to start and stop and the upper right is used to reset (I'm used to the opposite).- The color of the first circular layer under the bezel (I suppose this is the solar charging part) is gray but in some light it gets an ugly-ish  purple shade- It takes a long time to circle almost 12 hours if your watch is one minute fast because I can only adjust the hands forward.  Fortunately, the watch is pretty accurate and I only do this several times a year, two  times because of the DST switch.Things I would like to see in a future improved model:- Atomic world-wide time adjustments- Count down timer.All in all, this is as good as it gets. I have been searching for a better watch for years, but I still haven't found what I'm looking for.",5.0,I can't find a better watch,1202515200,"02 9, 2008",Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,1.0

I normally wear a size 6 so I order the 37 (6.5-7). So the only real problem I have is I can not wear this shoe with socks because it makes the shoe too tight on my foot.

It was quite a challenge though to get the 'lunitidal interval' value needed to display the correct tidal data. The manual lists the required numbers for several cities around the world, but tidal dynamics are extremely complicated and tides can differ several hours even when you go up north or south of the same coast. What made it more complicated, was that I am living in a country where English is not the main language, and I had no idea what I was looking for in local terms. Finally, I understood that lunitidal interval is known here as ""gemiddeld havengetal"" (Dutch), but still it was a real challenge to find it for the spot of coast I was planning to use the watch. It was not on the internet - ultimaltely I was able to find it in a specialized yearly nautical publication. I can imagine that not being able to find the right data, might let some users down. Casio should have realized this and should have put more effort into guiding the user to the right values. It might be the reason Casio left this option out of the newer Sea-Patchfinder models. For users in The Netherlands: I have uploaded a table at [...]As far as the watch: one problem I have with it, is that it does not have dual time, which I really need. Second, I do not understand why Casio has chosen not to print a complete 360 degree scale around the watch, but chose to print COMP, BARO and START in between the 210 and 330 degree values instead. Especially since it is also shown near the buttons as well as on the display at about the same spot. OK, it is nice to have a compass and a barometre, but don't need to read THREE times every time I look at my watch. Another disadvantage is that it is impossible to verify that the watch is level when using the compass. Especially at sea, this is essential. The watch does have some sort of tilt sensor to automatically switch on the light when you look at your wrist - it would have been nice if this feature had been used to indicate if the watch was level.A small disadvantage is the short lighting period. Having so many batteries aboard, this period could have been longer than 1.5 seconds. Also, it would have been nice if the moon graph was inverted - with the positive display showing the lighted part of the moon. Standing outside in the dark and pressing the light switch, results in seeing the dark part of the moon lighted up on your watch... Also, a button lock would have been nice. Because of its size, it is easy to press a button by mistake. Especially the Baro-button is prone to be pressed inadvertially when bending your wrist, supporting yourself during an activity.Otherwise, a perfect watch, which is extremely light for its size. The distinct beep when you return to time mode, is very handy. The glass does not scratch, it is perfectly protected by the bezel ring. I am looking for a replacement after 3 years, since the black plastic light switch broke off (it is only supported at the back by a small metal pin which is off-center, so pressing it eventually makes the connection snap) and the barometric pressure sensor went offline recently. Since I really need dual time and I do not like the newer Pathfinder model using about 1/4 of the display telling me about the battery status (what a waste of space!), I decided to compromise the tidal data and buy a Suunto watch (with button lock and sensor that indicates if the compass is level) next.",4.0,Tidal data not that easy to adjustl,1125100800,"08 27, 2005",Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,1.0

Does it have cool, classic Moleskine styling?  Yes.  But is it worth it?  Probably not.The three things a luggage tag needs to do is: identify the owner of the bag, provide the bag with a distinctive mark for the owner to quickly retrieve it, and provide a distinctive mark so that non-owners don't accidentally take it.It does the first well enough, except that unlike other tags it doesn't have any way (via a removable business card or the like) to change the information.  Once you write in there, it's good.The second two, it doesn't do as well, at least in black.  Yes, it's distinctive, but not _that_ distinctive.  In my case, it's just another black tag on a black bag.  The other color tags would definitely add more pop and distinctiveness, but also lose the homely Moleskine charm.All in all, it seems sturdy enough to take abuse and will hold your information in it, but does it justify the price differential versus something you could pick up at a drug store?

So I decided to get other designs, keep the bags I want and use the others for gift bags again.  It's very portable, attractive, sturdy.  Great for traveling when you need an extra bag.  Oh, and it's good for the environment to keep reusing it.  I was compelled to get this particular design for the retro look because it's so quirky!",5.0,great gift bag,1241913600,"05 10, 2009",Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,1.0

Sadly, I did not discover this until after purchasing and trying the C-String.My wife and I were celebrating our 5th anniversary and I wanted to do something special to surprise her after dinner. I figured that we would have plenty of time that evening as my custom is to spend $1 per year that we've been together on each of our meals and that price point doesn't lend itself to multiple courses.I quickly discovered the C-String while doing alphabetical research on ""exciting underwear"" and I immediately ordered one. Between its exciting novelty and presumed ease of removal (more on this later), I was sure that my wife would feel like the luckiest girl in the world and that this would translate to an exciting evening.3-5 business days later, on our anniversary, I received a discrete brown box with a smile on the outside and giddily ran it upstairs to the bathroom where I could lock the door and be alone. Immediately, I wished that I had brought my computer with me as the product came without instructions and ""installation"" was not turning out to be intuitive. Without an online resource to guide me, I was forced to experiment.As it happens, and completely by accident, my first attempt ended up being correct (in terms of orientation), but I didn't realize it because of the awkward result that the C-String had in parting the company of certain anatomical neighbors for which distance is a source of pain. Plus, the C-String kept slipping down in a way that, from the back, probably resembled a video tape being ejected from a VCR.I tried reversing the garment. This solved the problem of parted anatomy in the front, but created a similar (and similarly painful) issue in the back. I found that squatting and bending forward alleviated some of the pain, but decided that maintaining this position for the entirety of our anniversary celebration, might clue my wife into the the surprise that lay in store for her, thus threatening the full force of its impact and the excitement that would be derived therefrom.Next, I tried wearing donning the C-String in a horizontal, rather than vertical configuration - with the band going around my hip. Initially, I found no discomfort, but as I stood there admiring my ingenuity in the mirror, I realized that something wasn't right. Imagine a pirate with his eyepatch covering his ear instead of his eye and you'll have a pretty good idea of what was going wrong for me.Again, my thoughts wandered to my computer but I could hear movement outside the door and knew that unless I wanted to risk discovery, I was on my own. I studied the C-String intently for a while and decided that the skinny end must go in back. The pain, I decided, I could handle, but how could I prevent it from slipping down? Then it hit me: Maybe the skinny bit at the back wasn't supposed to remain external (if you know what I mean).What happened next is something that I won't share, but it involved deep questions about my level of love and commitment to my wife, a small container of Vaseline, some blood, and some tears. I decided to hide the C-String and come back to it after I had found a computer and an ice pack.Sadly, I did not have time to consult my computer or experiment any further before the time came to depart for the restaurant. Not wanting to waste the C-String, I adjusted the frame ever-so-slightly and told my wife that it was a Google Glass that I was going to use to record our date. Happily, she believed me and was thrilled at the idea. Sadly, she shared my plans with the woman who took our order at the restaurant and we were immediately asked to leave.On the plus side, I didn't have to explain why I didn't have any video of our evening. 2 Stars.",2.0,Warning: Product is not for Men,1403395200,"06 22, 2014",Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,0.0

Indeed, he had mastered a number of genres, but the flavor on these tracks echo George Shearing's influence on him, as well as other sources. For example his friend, bassist Al McKibbon, exerted a great deal of influence on Cal to immerse himself in this genre, which opened doors to other like minded musicians. McKibbon is not on this album, but the line-up clearly shows why the music on this album is true to form: Manuel Duran on piano, Carlos Duran on bass and dditional percussion by Edgard Rosales, Bayardo Velarde and Luis Miranda.This album is This is credited as Cal Tjader's Modern Mambo Quintet.

I would only wish that SOLAR's CEO, Dick Griffey had promoted this album more because this album was so hot that it's still burning after almost 30 years with sassy selections, ""Wild Girls"" and ""Heartbreaker"" thus putting Never Underestimate the Power of the Woman album to great shame.  Those two songs were the very first songs that Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis produced as well as the very first songs in their long 30 year resume although they were not hit singles. Lakeside-like highlights include the ballads ""Convince Me"" and ""An Offer I Can't Refuse"" to balance out their bad girl image while they boogie down with the infectious title track and ""Don't Hide Our Love"". Jam and Lewis also cooked up the slightly toned down ""The Man in My Life"" and retain their sassiness with the defiant, ""All Turned Out""  Due to the fact that Mr Griffey focused more on Shalamar and The Whispers, this album was largely ignored as well the album has been crafted and it took the girls 2 more years to make themselves a household name with their massive hit album, Meeting in the Ladies Room.  Although the girls handled their own instruments (with some help), the production was all handled by either Jam & Lewis or Lakeside (except that Bernadette Cooper co-produced ""Heartbreaker"") which was probably a good thing to avoid overkill.

However, I have found a few flaws with the bag during my  short tenure.First off, the notebook sleeve is padded on the front, two  sides, and the bottom. There is no padding for the back. While the back is  normally resting on your lower back, I find that in cases where the bag is  set down on the floor a little hard, damage may result from this lack of  padding in this area. Although this is easily fixed by a piece of syrofoam,  I don't see how such an obvious oversight came to be.The second minor  flaw is a missing handstrap. Although the shoulder strap is great for  resting on your shoulder, the longer length makes it a poor handstrap. A  handstrap along the top of the bag would be incredibly handy for just  picking it off the seat next to you, or off the floor for a short walk the  next room, saving the time of heaving it up and slinging it over your  shoulder.Lastly, despite claims to the contrary, this bag will not cut  it for a student, and especially a college student. There is simply not  enough capacity for books and materials. I feel that you can accomdate a  notebook, four medium size books standing up on end, along with a small  assortment of writing utensils. However, the bag at this point is fairly  maxed out, and leaves little room for expansion and other items your work  or your computer may need, such as a mouse and power supply or paper and  files.",3.0,A few flaws...,965606400,"08 7, 2000",Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,0.0

For some reason I decided I needed a Stormtrooper helmet to wear with my Utilikilt. I know... an odd combination to some, but makes perfect sense to me. I started looking for helmets here on Amazon and found the one I wanted. Only problem was it costs $150. I actually put it in my wish list to ponder whether I'd be willing to part with $150 for something that I wasn't going to wear that often. Finally decided to go with the economy version and bought this one.First, as others have pointed out, the helmet that ships isn't the one in the photo. The black perforated eye areas actually have smoked gray plastic lenses (thankfully). Most everything else seems to be pretty accurate. Also, as others have pointed out, the helmet is in 4 pieces that don't stay together very well. You'll want some krazy glue or duct tape to make sure you're not fighting with it if you drop it or are a little rough on it. Even when it's put together I can see a bit of a gap on the seam that runs across the top. Not a huge deal as most people won't be able to see it, but it's there.I'd still like to have one of the better helmets, but until somebody smacks me on the bum with a golden spoon I'll settle for the $22 version. BTW, I also ordered a Stormtrooper white t-shirt (that looks like the torso of the stormtrooper armor) to wear with it.

I ordered the size 4-6 based on other reviews that stated it ran small. I'm so glad I did. To put it into perspective, my son wears 2T in pants and 3T in tops. My biggest complaint is I can't get it on him and I am going to have to attempt to alter it a bit so he can wear it. It is a one-piece suit and has only a small opening on the back to put it on. This means the entire thing has to go on from the bottom up. I got his legs in and managed to pull it past his waist with a little wiggling, but when it came to getting his arms in the sleeves, forget it. I couldn't get his arms in at all because the opening is too small. I just hope I can get it on him later because he freaked out and won't let me near him with it. :( I love the costume. It's very cute and he's going to be adorable, but I'm disappointed that I have to attempt to make the opening bigger at risk of ruining the whole thing.Just wanted to update that I did manage to get it on him for Halloween by opening up the seam on the back by another couple of inches. It looked great. We had trouble with the hat, though. It fit him fine and tied under his chin, but when he talked, the movement pulled the Velcro off the one side. We opted to put on his Mickey ear hat from Disney instead. Overall, the costume did it's job.

It seemed most people were complaining about the size... but it fit my 18-month old daughter perfectly. She's in the 50th percentile for height and weight, and the costume fit like a glove. It wasn't tight on her arms at all (didn't even leave marks or anything) and I didn't have to cut it. It did differ slightly from the picture, but was super cute anyways. Everyone loved it on her. I googled the costume before purchasing and one of the halloween sites that had the costume had a size chart posted. I would recommend checking that out before buying, just to be sure about the size... but it fit my daughter and she looked great.Also, it was only one piece... so if you are planning on having your little one in the costume for any length of time, diaper changes might be difficult.

My daughter likes to dress up like her favorite princess, so he wanted to dress up, too. This costume is better quality than I had anticipated, based on some of the other reviews. It runs a little small, my son is five and the Child M (7-8) fits well over his clothes. The boot covers pull on over the white jumpsuit pants, and the costume can be worn without them. The arm panels, however, remain attached. The suit has an opening in the back, under the hood, for the child to get into it, and the opening has two Velcro dots to close it. This makes it a little bit awkward to get into, and especially awkward to take off to use the bathroom. To use the bathroom, you have to take off the whole top of the costume, and then hold onto it so it doesn't touch a dirty bathroom floor (I definitely had to help my son with this in a public bathroom).

We didn't see anyone else who had this type of Halloween costume in our area.  The only negatives were that the leg pieces were not sewn onto the costume, they were extra pieces you pulled onto your child's legs and they kept slipping down all evening.  That was very annoying for us and our three year old son.  Also, the size we bought was a 3/4T.

And, with only one significant, and one minor exception, my initial view is very favorable.  With luck, I'll remember to update this review after a few months use.The satchel appears to be well stitched together of durable canvas.  Its handsome but rugged appearance seems right for the task.  There's no inherent stiffness or padding, but my use includes carrying a couple of clipboards which resolves that issue.I have a feeling this case will hold up well for a number of years.  It's already very comfortable to carry and to use.Some reviewers have lamented the non-adjustable shoulder strap.  Since I won't use the shoulder strap often, it's a non-issue.  An aftermarket adjustable strap could be snapped into place easily.Several reviewers have commented negatively on the red and white oval BucketBoss name tag.  The name tag's shiny plastic texture and its brilliant red and white colors are way wrong.  Anyone who routinely carries a combination tool and document briefcase is most likely not trying to make a fashion statement, but this name tag just doesn't belong.Well, no problem.  It's attached by a single row of stitching around the edge.  I grasped an edge with needle nose pliers and carefully cut a stitch with a razor knife.  Then I was able to pull it away with fingers and continue slicing the stitches.  Took less time than you've spent reading this.  Looks just right without it.  A cloth logo in the proper colors would have worked well here, but it's perfectly fine without any logo.The one significant problem with the satchel is one that I saw clearly from the photos on Amazon's site and others, so it was no surprise.  I purchased anyway, intending to either live with it or to kludge a workaround.  That problem is that the ""Business Side"" and the ""Tool Side"" are reversed.The ""Tool Side"" features two rows of narrow stitched pockets intended for small hand tools.  Nicely done, but these tools need to be quickly accesible, and preferably with the satchel standing upright.  The ""Tool Side"" therefore could be better utilized under the flap.The ""Business Side"" is used for stowing file folders and documents which might benefit from a slightly greater bit of security.  The ""Business Side"" then would have been better placed in the zippered section.  To some this may seem a quibble.  Depends on your particular work situation, I suppose.  For me the reversal would have been far better.Still, I bought it, and I like it.  I looked around quite a bit and could find nothing else that fit the bill as well.",4.0,"Now, better than new...",1346284800,"08 30, 2012",Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,1.0

With only a few small but deep pockets inside, there wasn't a good place for the phone, and things tended to get very disorganized. I'm a clinical psychologist with 3 offices [and a home office] so I tend to carry around a lot of junk, including charts, other papers etc. and with the Bucket Boss I'm no longer always rooting around trying to find something that I tossed in there. In my search, I looked at other canvas bags that could take the beating of all the moving about that I need to do - the Lands End ..., the L.L. Bean case ... and one from Duluth Pack ... but I saw this one in the ... Tool Crib catalog for... and it kept intriguing me - in part because of the lighter color, which I thought would help with being able to find my ""lost"" things. At that price there seemed little to lose but boy, was I pleasantly surprised when I got it. The pictures and text do not do it justice. It has tons of pockets, places for pens, wallet, checkbook...you name it. I've used it for over a month now and I can't find anything I'd change in the design, nor any flaws in the construction. In fact, I love it so much that I'm going to order a ""replacement"" now, so that when I wear this one out I'll have one already. My only qualm in doing that is that it is so well made, it may never wear out, but I'm sure my heirs will be able to put it to good use long after I don't need it any longer.",5.0,Better and cheaper too!,991699200,"06 5, 2001",Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,1.0

I also wanted them to have a nice appearance and not look like dedicated work suspenders. These were the only ones to fit that criteria for me. The brownish burgundy color is very rich and the chrome buckles and hardware look nice and function well. I had no problem adjusting these suspenders. The range is very accommodating from small to large. They can quickly and easily be attached and removed once the loop attachments are installed on your belt by using the clasps, for bathroom breaks and such. Four loop attachments are included (one kit). I actually bought these for casual wear so I removed the heavy shoulder pads. The process is easy. (1) unbuckle both front straps. (2) slide the horizontal chest strap down and off. (3) slide the shoulder pads off. (4) reinstall the chest strap and make up the buckles. Done. You could also slide them off the back by removing that round strap guide (thing) which is the way I did it because the chest strap was so tight, I did not think that it was made to slide. It has since loosened up some. In the picture the horizontal chest strap appears to be riveted on but on my pair you can slide it and adjust the height. It is tight and requires some force to move, so it does not flop around. I would have prefered a chest strap that attached with clamps, (clamps that would not scar the leather). Mine uses leather attachment loops. These could potentialy become loose as the leather stretches, to the point where the strap might fall down, but I could be wrong. They seem a little expensive. When you break them down into their seperate components, there is not a lot to them that you could not pick up at the local hardware store for a few bucks, but what are you going to do, make them yourself, c'mon. They were delivered fast right to my front door by Fed Ex, I think it was Fed Ex. They can be a little restricting but that is the nature of suspenders, I guess. I recently removed the chest strap which makes them less restricting and more comfortable. As they break in and soften I can foresee them becoming very comfortable. These are the first pair of suspenders that I have owned and I really like them. Everything I wrote is truthful to my experierce. Yours may be completely different. If it is, I'm sorry.

ThePlayCenter software makes it easy to rip/transfer music to theJukebox.  The battery life is reasonable considering the hardwarethat's being supported...anywhere from 3-4 hours depending onfrequency of use and file bitrates.  The 5 minute anti-skip is prettysilly (although it works as advertised) considering that the Jukeboxweighs almost 3 pounds and contains a 6GB hard drive.  Personally, Idon't like jogging with hard drives in my pocket.  The Jukebox'snavigation system is fairly usable but not something my mother coulduse without some training.The absence of forward and rewindcapability has proven to be most annoying.  Perhaps this can berectified with a software update, allowing the user to hold down theSkip Next or Skip Previous buttons to perform these functions.  Also,the inability to compose playlists directly on the Jukebox is quiteirritating as well.  You must go back to the PlayCenter software tocompose and transfer your playlists.The first real problem thatI've discovered ... that the loudness ofthe audio is poor.  I've turned the volume to it's maximum and wasunable to really feel overwhelmed in any way.  I've also fiddled withthe EAX effects and discovered that this &quot;feature&quot; furtherzaps the audio's loudness and adds a noticeable artificial quality tothe sound.The second problem is the sheer slowness of theJukebox's operating system.  This is a serious problem because ALL ofthe Jukebox's functionality is digital - including the slow-to-respondvolume control.  I realize that the Jukebox is a computer, but it'sbeing pitched to consumers as a consumer electronic device and thusshould be as responsive.  Perhaps this problem is rooted in a slow CPUor perhaps it's because the operating system and the file indexes areon the hard drive.  Whatever the reason, this needs some seriouswork.As for accessories, I'd like to see a car audio kit with afixed FM channel transmitter + AC charger.  A simple mounting kitmight be a nice as well.  Also, a remote control with LCD would be awelcome accessory, assuming that the Jukebox can transmit as well asreceive infrared signals.I hope Creative is listening to (orreading) these reviews.

As we are all aware until now the storage capacity of the players available has been wholly inadequete for anything other than short term listening pleasure.In my job I do quite a bit of travel and spend a lot of hours in the office. The ability to tranport the favorite bits from my music collection with me is a Godsend. The 6 GB Nomad Jukebox was therfore a must-have product.I havn't been disappointed. The Playcentre 2 software makes ripping your cd's and transferring mp3 files a breeze, although it is annoying (but not surprising) that two-way transfer isn't possible.I find the player navigation really easy to use. I would suggest that some of the other reviewers havn't played around with their menus yet. Contrary to reports, there is a facility whereby the active queuelist can be randomly played. The stop key also acts as a pause button which is obviously useful if listening to audiobooks.The headphones look smart and produce a good sound. I would agree however that the EAX sound system is gimmicky and those with a keen ear may be disappointed.Despite my minor quibbles, I have to come back to the fact that on my system I currently have 1250 of my favorite songs with room for more. This sort of portability was a fantasy until this player came along.If you want your music on the move the positive points of the Nomad Jukebox more than outweigh the negatives.

It stores 6 GB of music with intuitive navigation of its  various screens and the 20 hours of preloaded music allow easy appreciation  of its  great features and a great chance to play with its bells and  whistles before I ripped my own music. Additional CD's ripped and  transferred to it sound just as great (ripped at 128 kb).  The Play Center  2 Software allows easy transfer from the CD or downloaded from the internet  and can be transferred to either your music Library on the Hard Drive, the  Jukebox, or some destination on MY Computer. The biggest challenge with  Play Center 2 is managing all those windows of track information. Ripping  and transferring to the Jukebox takes 10 -15 minutes per CD.It comes  with 2 sets of Nickel-Metal Hydride rechargable batteries, good-sounding  Creative back headphones, an AC Adapter-Charger and a USB Cable.  I like  the fact that you can also record by microphone or by jack from an external  analog source in wave format to be converted by computer into MP3 and  uploaded back to the Jukebox.Unlike some MP3 Players, the volume at the  maximum is more than sufficient.  I love the EAX effects that simulate  Concert Hall or other environments controlled by whatever percentage you  choose.  The ability to upgrade will allow support for the infrared slot  and other future music formats.On the downside, the weight is heavier  than that of a CD player and it is not suitable for jogging in spite of the  5 minute buffer.

I thought it would be a great way to store and carry my whole mp3 collection and I was very excited. Unfortunately, I found the software very user unfriendly, the portable itself almost impossible to operate and, worst of all, the worst power-guzzler I've ever seen in a device of its size.The software is easy to install, but to transfer MP3's you have to have full IDV3 tags on each track or it all gets dumped in the wrong folder or playlist, and that means laborious tagging that can take hours. The CDDB tracklistings are sometimes way off base, (it thought my Craig David was a Faith Hill CD or something like that), and when the software rips off CD's, it hardly compresses the files at all, averaging at around 12MB per song (!), which means you're not really using the available 6Gb to its fullest. The playlist/album sorting style is not very efficient, since you have to transfer files to the nomad before you can assign playlists, which means that more often than not you end up with alot of 'stray' albums, (i.e. an album with one or two songs on it). I finally got sick of it and just labelled all my individual songs as having one generic album name and had done with it.Controlling the Nomad itself is rather difficult. You can select playlists or albums and queue them in the general playlist, but the controls are sluggish and the sound is, frankly, near inaudible, even on full blast.Finally, there's the battery issue, which is really the worst of the Nomad's many faults. Creative offers four rechargeable batteries and a power cord for the unit but claims that it is designed to be compatible with other brands of batteries as well. UNFORTUNATELY, I decided to test that on a weekend trip, leaving the bulky DC converter home and deciding to buy batteries as needed. I bought a four pack of Duracell Ultras, and put them in. In HALF AN HOUR the Nomad shut down for lack of battery power. I checked the batteries and found that they still had half their power, but the Nomad refused to start up for more than a second. I bought regular Duracells, and guess what? The Nomad wouldn't even start! Normal batteries don't even have the juice to START the Nomad, let alone power it.I got this as a GIFT and I feel I've been cheated. DON'T waste your money on this one. Try Archon's Jukebox.

I have the original 6 gig model, but last I checked, it's upgradable to 60 gigs, since it uses a standard laptop harddrive, which can be changed. I've found 6 gigs to be plenty for when I'm on the go, and use my Nomad primarily in my taxi, where I hook it's line output to the line input on my older Pioneer car stereo.  It's truly perfect for 12 hour shifts as a cab driver, and my passengers love it too. The sound is nothing short of awesome if you have good sounding mp3s, since it's sound hardware is basically a SoundBlaster Live. The firmware is upgradable too, so this player can adapt to new file formats as they're introduced in the future.In order to fully appriciate this player, you should already have a sizable mp3 library. Mine was up to about 120 gigs when I bought my Nomad Jukebox last year.  Realise, it will take you a while to get 6 gigs of mp3s into it with USB.  Once you fill it up though, it's a real pleasure to remove the songs you're tired of and add more new ones.The Playcenter 2 software that ships with the Nomad Jukebox is completely awful; so bad I nearly returned mine shortly after I bought it. There are much better programs for making mp3s which I of course already had.  Fortunatly, there is also other software available for the Nomad, so you don't have to use the wreched PlayCenter software at all. I've been using Notmad Explorer from Redchair Software for almost a year with my Nomad, and love it.  Notmad (for Windows) integrates into Windows Explorer and makes moving files to and from the Nomad Jukebox via USB as easy as copying them to another harddrive, and gives network support that as far as I could tell was absent in PlayCenter.  Notmad Explorer also lets you create and edit your playlists so you don't have to do it with the tiny bottons and screen on the player.  It also has the ability to edit the ID3 tags of the files on the Nomad Jukebox, a crucial feature that PlayCenter lacks.The most amazing feature of the Nomad Jukebox, which I rarely see mentioned, is not only is it a player, it's also a recorder, and an exceptional one at that. Using it's analog audio input, It makes recordings that put to shame anything I've EVER heard before. It records to 16-bit wave files at either 44k (CD quality) or 48k (slightly higher DAT quality). I've been using it to digitally record my vinyl and cassettes, and have also made amazing recordings of concerts and band jam sessions with it. The wave files I easily move to a PC with Notmad Explorer to edit and compress into mp3s. I've been making mp3s from analog sources with PCs since 1999, and the quality of the mp3s made from wave files recorded with the Nomad Jukebox are so good it's stunning. I've been collecting records since 1973, so this feature is really a dream come true. Oddly enough, it lacks an input level meter, but the recording level is adjustable, so with a little trial and error you can get it perfect.Another perk is that the Nomad Jukebox runs on 12 volts DC; perfect for using in a car. The included rechargable batteries are only good for about 3 hours, but they're standard AA batteries, so as better battery technology develops, this too can improve. I'm amazed how many people complain about this, as all things considered, three hours of playback is very good. Few laptops will play mp3s this long on thier batteries, and additional batteries for the Nomad are much cheaper than any laptop battery by a long shot.The EAX feature that's so hyped I've found to be a complete waste.  Why add cheezy echo delay effects to a player that without them sounds excellent?No, the Nomad Jukebox is not very suitable for active use (jogging, snowboarding, etc), but it's really not intended for that. I have found it to be perfect for bicycle riding around town, as long as the ride is under two hours. I also use it while riding the bus and walking. The supplied carrying case is pretty useless, but since the Nomad Jukebox is roughly the size of a portable CD player, it wasn't hard to find a nice suitable case for it with a strap and room for it's cables.The complaints about CDDB file naming issues really amuse me. It's a user-submitted database, of course it's riddled with errors. Am I the only person left that's not too lazy to type in my own ID3 tags? This is very easy to do with Winamp before uploading the files to the Nomad. One note about ID3 tags: use ID3v1, not ID3v2 if you care about continous play albums, otherwise you'll hear a pause in the music as the Nomad Jukebox changes tracks. This is because ID3v1 uses the mp3 file header, and ID3v2 appends itself to the end of the file, making the mp3 slightly larger, enough to cause a pause. The Nomad Jukebox is the ONLY player I've seen that will not insert a pause between files, but only if there are no ID3v2 tags. Those are easily removed with Winamp as well. I know some people prefer WMA to mp3, but personally I'm not impressed.In short, the Nomad Jukebox is a remarkably good portable audio component if used with third party software and accessories. It's much more than merely an mp3 player, and well worth every penny. Unlike other mp3 devices, it's fully upgradable, and should never really be obselete. I've nearly stopped burning CDs since I got it, since I can hook my Nomad Jukebox up to nearly any stereo or amplified speakers. I've yet to see a better way to take a large amount of music with you. Sure, the iPod is smaller, but it's features don't even compare to the Nomad Jukebox. Once you've made the jump to this harddrive based player, memory based ones seem laughably limited, and carrying CDs with you, even mp3-CDs, seems silly.",5.0,"I've had my Nomad Jukebox a year, and absolutely love it!",1046822400,"03 5, 2003",Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,1.0

Charging the batteries up for the Jukebox is a royal pain since after the batteries are at 100% it will then start draining them for another charge.

Firstly remember nothing is perfect and not all people are going to be pleased! It doesn't get a five rating because as mentioned by other reviewers the battery life does not really equate to the required portability of some users. However I do get a lot of use from it, in the car it plugs into the line in, it gets used on the plane when travelling and when visiting London it is connected with the line out to the system there, giving me access to most of my music collection. Its use is simple and the structure of the access to the files is great giving multiple methods of accessing the type of music you want and the tracks easily moved to the playlist. As for the problems experienced in ripping and loading from the PC. Personally I use MusicMatch Juke box to rip, organize and play music on my PC so the files are already ripped and categorized etc by the CDDB system. This makes it very easy to transfer music to the Jukebox as the Playcenter software which comes with it enables you to locate the folders/files on your PC and just load them across to your Jukebox, this I have found to be very quick, and on the occassion that I did find one corrupt file is was to do with the original ripping and not the transfer. It is a great means to move and listen to a lot of music, its not a put in your pocket whist you jog player. The only thing that it was missing in my opion was its inability to act as a stand alone player, which has now been addressed by the Cambridge Labs Playdock, which I have just ordered!

Gerbino ""Longhaul trucker, Chihuahua...","[31, 32]","Let me get this straight... you want to carry a $450 gadget with a hard drive in it with you when you jog? No sir!I have been using the nearest product to a competitor for monthes... the Personal Jukebox 100 from Han-Go electronics, both the 4.68 and 6.4gig versions. The Creative Nomad JB is by far a better developed, more feature laden product. It has many, many improvements over the PJB-100 including the excellent software that allows you to cue up an unlimited number of MP3 tracks to transfer then go away while the USB chugs along. The PJB-100 makes you go in small bunches of tracks a directory at a  time then puts them in Alphabetical order no matter the album order. The only way to preserve order in the PJB-100 is to rip directly to the unit which leaves no MP3 on your computer, and is slower than a modern PC as well.By comparison the Nomad preserves album order by default and organizes automatically by Playlist, Album, Artist, and Genre. The PJB requires you to make playlists when transferring from the PC by making 'copies' of the tracks on the unit. These take up no space but you can't manipulate the playlists except when connected to the PC. The Nomad lets you do all this easily with the unit itself, a much better method.Battery life... The PJB-100 lasts 12 full hours of continuous use on a charge of its Lithium Ion battery. The Nomad claims 4 hours but this is dependant upon many other factors. Like how well behaved the Nickel Metal-Hydride batteries are. This is the kind that has a 'memory' and degrades rapidly if not completely exhausted, then completely charged. The normal use pattern of this sort of unit means this isn't going to happen. I feel that Creative's including a second set is more ominous than friendly. And they warn on several labels and stickers to use Only Creative NiMh batteries as replacements even though they are nominally the same as any other 1.2 volt, AA form rechargable except in that NimH and Nicads have different discharge curves. I do not choose to experiment with a widget this expensive. And at any rate the unit is best suited for staionary, home use where it can remain plugged in.The PJB-100 has a car kit. This is a BAD thing. In use one failed with a broken line out jack... it only has ONE! Even after getting warranty repairs the unit failled again only weeks later from HD death. This time out of warranty. The second unit started making model helicopter noises when the HD runs so it lives in semi retirement at home now. We will see how well the Nomad likes the highways but I suspect it will stand up to the vibration and bouncing a little better. It is a sturdier sort of creature to be sure.EAX effects... yawn. You can distort and twist your music in a wide variety of fashions. I use MP3 to AVOID this. What would be usefull is Not included. That is Normalization. Using WinAmp you can have you choice of free normalization plug-ins. MusicMatch Jukebox used to have a normalization option but it never worked right and is now absent from the current version. CD's do not have equal levels... much less Mp3's ripped from them. Anyone who has listened to a playlist from many different CD's can recall turning up the volume to hear a quiet track then being blasted into next week by the next track from a louder Cd. This is also what keeps Windows Media Player 7 and RealPlayer from being usefull MP3 players.Still... I like everything about the design of this thing except the shape. The PJB-100 is squarish. At least it has a flat surface on the bottom and fits in a large pocket. The Nomad is CD player shaped sorta. But there is no convenient way to HOLD it. The PJB-100 comes with a case that shows it's display and exposes it's controls. The Nomad case cannot be used while playing it. No hole for the jack or controls. Just a bag. And it is not going in anyone's pockets. Again... much more suited to live on the shelf hooked into the stereo. The PJB-100 comes with a mini-plug to RCA phono-plug 'Y' cable to connect to the stereo. Not so the Nomad though it DOES have 2 lineouts and surround capability. Very nice.There is currently no control to use with the IR port and no 12 volt car adapter though Creative say both are coming. ... As the market grows the prices go low. Enjoy!",5.0,Jog with it?

I had a Riovolt first but it was hopeless at playing CD-RW discs (yes it said CD-RW compatitable on the box), then I had an Archos 6000 that melted (literally) when it was charging.So purchasing the Nomad and its a dream come true. I can store 2500 96bit/sec high quality WMA files (WMA is better than MP3), arrange the songs into albums, genres, artists and playlists, which is a godsend when looking up a specific song or to play songs in a specific order. One feature which is so handy that it brought tears to my eyes, is the ability to add songs to the active playlist as you go, without interupting the current song playing. The included software is easy to use and enables CD ripping, organizing and titleing of your favourite songs. It only takes a few moments to transfer a lot of files through the included USB lead.The unit itself is a very sleek silver-blue affair that has high-quality fixtures, positive-acting buttons and a very clear backlit LCD that has a very easy-to-understand menu system, backed up by 3 navigation buttons that aid you through the menus. The drive unit itself is very quiet and smooth and is responsive when navigating songs.The unit has oodles of sound-tweaking modes such as a graphic equaliser, environment settings and stereo wide modes, but even in normal mode, the unit sounds so damn good you'll hardly use the sound modes.

I wish I could give it 3 and a half stars, but 3 will do.  Here's why:The First two days after buying it:  No real problems.  Unit worked great, and I dumped a full 6 gigs of archived music onto it without too much hassle.  The Creative Playcenter software was fairly easy to use, and I had to change a lot of the ID3 information with it, but overall it wasn't too painful.  I do wish that Creative would dump the stupid-looking pseudo-dialogs in their software and devote their time to slicker functionality.  The fact that I can't resize the Playcenter window drives me up the wall every time I open it -- you only get to pick from two small sizes.  Also, how about a pack-in utility to generate ID3 information based on file name?  I had to grab a shareware tagger.On the evening of the third day, I powered up the Nomad for my daily walk (Yes, I've been walking with it, and it hasn't skipped once).  It hung at the 'Preparing Library' screen and never, ever advanced to the Active Queue List.  Pressing the reset button on the bottom of the unit didn't fix it.  Performing a drive cleanup from the maintenance menu didn't fix it.  Finally, I had to completely re-format the whole hard drive and that got it.  Then I had to download all my music to it all over again, and I had to change all the same ID3 information all over again...quite frustrating.  Tech support was quick to comment on the issue (I had a response the next day) but by then I'd already done the format.I realize that before the calamitous crash, I had flashed the Nomad's firmware to 2.91, the latest offered by the Creative website at the time.  It worked for my walk that night, but I wonder if performing the upgrade somehow changes how files are accessed on boot and that's why it crashed.  It's been about two weeks since I restored everything, and there have been no further problems.  In fact, they've added some good functionality, like being able to fast-forward through songs.Now that I've had a lot of time to play with the software (I have Playcenter version 2.5 now) and the hardware, I've decided that I probably can't live without my Nomad for long periods of time.  Being able to take a good portion of my CD collection with me is way, way cool.  I have some suggestions for those of you who are still experiencing problems, for what it's worth:*  Upgrade your Nomad firmware and PC software to the latest versions at Creative's website.  After flashing your firmware, FORMAT your hard drive, and consider losing your music collateral damage.  It'll be much more stable once you're current.  If you're just starting out, do this before you move any music over to it.*  I compressed all of my variable-bitrate and 128kbit .mp3 files to 112 without any audible loss of quality.  Doing this freed up about 20% more space for music.  Not bad!*  Grab a freeware ID3 editor/tagger online.  The tools supplied with the Nomad just aren't good enough.  There are some great bulk-edit utilities out there.*  Creative's Nomad FAQ says you can jog with your player.  I've done it and it works great -- it has yet to skip.  I'd recommend a belt with a pouch for carrying.

Biggest disappointment, they want you to charge the batteries 12 full hours before using. I'm sure everyboby is doing that, ha ha. Even though I followed instructions the best play time I've gotten is appr. 3 hours. They send you a second set of batteries, but they have to be charged in the unit so I usually keep recharging the same 4 over and over unless I have say 16 hours between uses. I've got 1400 songs on mine and still have appr. 300 mg left. It plays beautifully, the sound is great, downloading is a snap. The biggest quirk I have found is when setting up a playlist I spend a few minutes doing that, it plays the first song or so and then says the playlist is empty. Other times it plays for hours so I haven't figured that out yet. Each time you gear up it takes more than a minute to load the library, a bit annoying. One of my biggest deals is with Creative, I have e-mailed them a question a month ago and have yet to receive a reply. The unit runs on 12 volt DC. The AC adapter puts out 12.29 volts DC. I ask them if I could run the unit on a standard cigarette lighter wich puts out appr. 14 volts wth the vehicle running. Haven't tried it yet, don't want to burn up This $500. toy just yet. I recommend it, but it needs longer battery life, tech support that will answer your questions and it will be hard to beat.

But it doesn't live up to the expectations. Mainly because of a number of software implementations (or lack thereof), which might be overcome in the next releases of the Nomad Player software and the bundled PC software Package 'Playcenter'. For now, the Nomad Jukebox package doesn't cut it for me, and as such, I have returned, for the first time in my e-shopping life, a product because it didn't met my expectations...A large array of magazine advertisements and articles would let you to believe that the Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox is the best of the best of MP3 players. Well, because you can read all about the good stuff about this player in other places, let me focus on the 'features' that ruined my experience with this device.Missing from the package: the line-in cable to record music onto the Nomad player. When I buy a 400+ dollar device, I don't want to have to run to the store to buy a cable to hook the Nomad to my tape deck - especially not because the recording capabilities are one of the advertised features. And, by the way, the cables to connect the Nomad Jukebox to your speakers (or amplifier) are also not included.Unable to record MP3 format. Yes, the Nomad Jukebox can record through it's line-in jack, but only in the bulky WAV format. You then have to upload the file to the PC, convert WAV to MP3 format, and redownload. Ugly. Probably caused by the fact that there is not enough cpu horsepower in the Nomad to encode in MP3 format. This limits the amount of music that you can record on the Nomad Jukebox, as a WAV file is 20x larger than the same MP3 file.No battery life information. There is no way to see the charge-status of the batteries in the Nomad Jukebox. So you don't know if your batteries are fully charged while you are connected to an AC outlet, and you don't know how much longer you will be able to listen to the music while playing on batteries. Ugly - I thought every battery powered device offered a battery status indicator.Ugly filing mechanism. When files are copied from the PC to the Nomad Jukebox player, the filename (and directory structure) on the PC is lost. So if you organized your MP3 files on your PC by means of directories and filenames, you will find this a very unpleasant surprise. While downloading songs, the Nomad Jukebox makes its own filename for each MP3 file, based on the information in the ID3 fields of the MP3 file. And let me tell you: most MP3 files you will have do not have this TAG properly filled out, so make sure you have a few extra days to correct all this on your PC before downloading your music to the Nomad Jukebox. Getting all the ID3 tags of all your MP3 files right is mandatory if you want to use the Nomad Jukebox, a long and tedious job.Download issues Because of the 'Ugly Nomad Jukebox Filing Mechanism' as described above, downloading your music collection from your PC to the Nomad Jukebox is likely to fail. This download stops whenever 2 files with the same 'new derived filename' are detected. And given the fact that all your PC directory and filename information is trashed, and the filenames are deducted from the embedded ID3 information, this is very likely to happen a few times to you.Unable to search for songs. On the MP3 player, you can not search for a song (with the name), or for any keyword (i.e. word in the title of a song). The only searches that are supported are artist searches. Euh ? Did somebody fail to implement all other software routines ? This is very user un-friendly.Unable to navigate within a single track: you can't fast-forward within the same track - real annoying if you are listening to a one-hour radio show or another lengthy piece of music - you always need to (re)start from the beginning of the song.No way to update song information on the Nomad Player. OK, here is the deal: you are listening to your music while traveling, and you notice that the song-information is not accurate. You want to correct the name of the artist, the song, the album, the genre, or anything about the song. Impossible. You need to note it down on a piece of paper, change it on the MP3 song on your PC, and redownload the song to the Nomad. Very user un-friendly. In essence, this also means there is no syncing of any information between the Nomad and the PC - you can only download (wav, mp3) and upload (wav only) between the PC and the Nomad Jukebox, there is really no syncing like with a Palm-pilot to ensure that information is updated once you change it on the PC or the player.Uploading MP3's doesn't work. Surely a software issue, implemented to restrict digital copying ? Frankly, I don't care. When I go down to my friends with my MP3 player, I want them to be able to read/copy what I have on the hard-disc. And I want to be able to hook my player to their PC, download songs, and later on (if I like them) upload them to my PC for backup purposes. I can do this with all removable media MP3 devices, why can't I do this with the Creative Nomad Jukebox ?Hey, perhaps some of these features are available on the Nomad Jukebox, and I just didn't find it. That's definitely possible. The printed documentation included in the package and the software demo included on the CD-Rom are definitely not complete...",1.0,Great idea and concept - but software just doesn't cut it,975715200,"12 2, 2000",Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,0.0

If the advertised four hours is &quot;low battery life&quot;, then battery life is low; however, understanding the power requirements of the device, I am pleased with the battery life.  Since batteries recharge in the device, even while it's playing (albeit more slowly), I don't often discharge the batteries, and I carry spares anyway.  Creative ships two sets of rechargable batteries with the player.  I've also used Eveready Ni-MH rechargables and recharged the Creative batteries in an Eveready charger without a hitch.  Rechargables slowly discharge even if you don't use them, so you should recharge spares occassionally.Booting the device takes 10-15 seconds.  It's a little irksome, at times, but it's quite tolerable.  Clearly, faster response time is always better.  Once the device is booted, it responds quickly in my experience.  I'd like to see a more effective album/title search feature, like a bisection search.  Ideally, I'd see the first and last titles in the first half of a list followed by the first and last titles in the last half of the list, then I'd pick the half of the list I want to search further, and so on.I've had few problems with portability.  Using a carrying case designed for a portable CD player, I've walked the streets and bladed with the device.  I wouldn't worry about biking with it either.  If I were a runner, I'd use a solid state device and live with its limited capacity while running, but I'm very happy with the portability of the Jukebox.  I had a minor fall while blading with the device, and it held up nicely, not even a skip.  Understanding the potential for disk head crash, I don't recommend too much rough and tumble.  On the other hand, I bought the extended warranty.I don't understand the volume gripes, but I haven't destroyed my hearing with heavy metal yet, either.  Wynonna is more my speed.  The volume meter varies from 1 through 20, and I like 12 in a quiet setting.  The default is 16, and I find that setting a little loud.  I don't understand the headphone gripes either, but I'm not a phonophile.  The sound quality seems better than the headphones I had used with my portable Philips CD player.I'm aware of one competitive device, the Archos Jukebox 6000.  It also features a 6 gb hard drive, usb connection, some EAX-like features and generally seems a lot like the Nomad, but it looks very different, rectangular like a portable cassette player.  It has a smaller cache, only 2MB, not enough for an entire song, compared with 8MB on the Nomad...The only other portable mp3 player I'd consider at this point is one of the portable CDRW devices with mp3 playback.  Some of those devices also play standard CDs.  A 6 gig drive will probably hold all the music I'll ever want in one place at one time, so I like the hard drive approach, but I'd definitely hate to deal with a disk crash.  I've seen a nice looking CDRW device with mp3 playback and an 8MB cache from Sony...  I didn't notice if it played standard CDs, and I suspect it would burn an mp3 file on a CDW much more slowly than the Nomad writes its hard drive.Of course, the Nomad Jukebox has a secret it isn't telling.  Someday, soon, it will morph into a handheld/wearable, general purpose computer, or a peripheral for a palmtop at least.  The next Nomad will probably have a 20 gig drive, but something bigger and better is always six months away these days.",5.0,Three thumbs up,988243200,"04 26, 2001",Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,1.0

It is by far the most used used electronic gadget that I own. It is a perfect traveling companion for me since I don't like carrying all of my CD's on road trips and I can bring along half of my music collection without the headaches of storage space. I have found that WMA at 64kbs music sounds as good to me as 128kbp of MP3 formatted music. Since the Jukebox holds 1000 hours of MP3 formatted music I have realistically doubled my listening pleasure. The only drawbacks are load time tranferring music from my PC to the Jukebox via the USB transfer cable. I wish it came with a Firewire transfer capability. The other drawback is low battery life. I only get about 2 1/2 hours of use with the rechargeable batteries that it came with. Solution: By more rechargeable batteries and a charger.

I purchased it because of theglowing reviews I found everywhere, especially on Creative's excellent support newsgroup.Maybe my high hopes set false expectations, or maybe I'm just though to please, but I was not thrilled with my purchase.I purchased it hoping to go jogging with it, but learned from comments on the newsgroup that because of the shock I better not use it for jogging if I wanted it to continue to work.  It was also a bit too bulky and heavy for jogging.  I thought maybe I could at least use on the treadmill at the health club (i.e. put the unit on the treadmill newspaper rack instead of carrying it) but I never got a chance.Before I tried using at the treadmill, I downloaded the new firmware and installed on my unit, and after that it would not boot!  Creative's tech support said &quot;Wow, I've never heard of a problem like that.&quot;  To their credit and Amazon's, they were both very willing to allow me to return it, either for repair (at Creative) or replacement (via Amazon.)Amazon immediately shipped me another one when they got my email, but ironically they misshipped (I don't blame them, I've order many times from Amazon and this was the first mixup.)  By then, I decided to simply &quot;return&quot; it for good and wait for the item to &quot;mature.&quot;  I told them not to bother sending me another, and I returned both the dead unit and the misshipment.Additional info about the NJB: The carrying case does not have a place for the poor quality headphones, and you can't listen to the NJB when it is in the case because of headphone jack gets in the way (unless you turn the NJB sideways, then the case won't close.)On the positive side, it is a really nice to have all your music in one little box you can carry (almost) anywhere, and if I wanted to use it for different reasons (i.e. not jogging and I carried a backpack that had a pocket to carry it, and the firmware upgrade had worked) I could probably recommend it  The newsgroup is a big plus.On the other hand it is a first generation unit and I think within one year there will be some much better offerings from Creative and other companies.

It's simply too heavy, large and bulky. The main advantage this player has is it's rather large 6 GB capacity, which I never was able to fill. However, it's negatives outweigh the positives. After using it for a couple of months, the batteries stopped holding a charge, and would only give me a half hour or so of play time.The issues mentioned in my old review such as the inability to fast forward/rewind and inability to upload songs from the player have been resolved with recent firmware and software updates. The headphones are great, and they served me for a long, long time, even after I stopped using the Jukebox itself.In my opinion, it is a far better idea to purchase a portable CD player that is able to play MP3 CDs, such as a Sony MP3 CD discman. It's far cheaper, lighter and easier to use. However, you obviously need a burner to burn the MP3 CDs... or, go buy a newer generation of this product!OLD REVIEW --I just got the Creative Nomad Jukebox today (in blue!) and so far I absolutely love it. I even rollerbladed with it. True, it is a bit bulky, but thats only because it has a laptop hard drive inside it. And hey, it may drain the batteries (or so people say), but when I used it for my 30-45 minute roller blade trip, it served me well. The batteries didn't die on me, and it was almost fresh out of the box. The batteries hadn't even had much charging yet. I don't have any idea why the people are complaining about the headphones and the volume settings. The headphones are comparable to the Sony Backphones, which are probably the greatest lightweight headphones ever made. The headphones are a bit tight out of the box, but I'm sure they will loosen with time. As for the volume issue, you've got to be either deaf, or standing in the middle of a busy airport runway if it's not loud enough for you.  The annoying things about it are:  1. The lack of fast forward/rewind functions  2. The large size (about the size of a Sony Discman player) 3. The delicate state of the player (Although I haven't done this, I don't think a Hard Drive would survive a fall) 4. The player's software doesn't allow you to download songs from the player into the computerThe positive features are: 1. SUPERIOR sound quality 2. Tons of EAX settings, and other sound settings. 3. EXTREME capacity. I dont think I will ever be able to fully use up the 6 gigabyte capacity of this great MP3 player. 4. Comes with an AC adapter. 5. Comes with a leather carry case. 6. The super-fast file transfer time. You can load a whole album on this baby in under 3 minutes. My old Parallel Port MP3 player took 15 minutes for about 3-4 songs. 7. The player comes preloaded with hours of music of different genres, including Pop, Classical, Rock and Electronica.All and all, the positives outweigh the negatives.

Most everything I saw people complaining about has been resolved with 2.56 firmware, and PlayCenter 2.1. The only thing not addressed was the battery life, which is hard to fix with software. You can now scan through songs by holding the skip button. Songs can be put in track order, and the data transfer rate jumped from 500k to over 3m.I love this device, and don't know how I lived with my Rio 500 (even with an extra 64 meg card) for so long. I still plan to use my Rio 500 because it is so much more portable, but this is great for my hour and a half commute to work, and while I'm at work (I'm a programmer, I just sit at a desk all day, so it doesn't have to be that portable).I haven't filled up the 6 gigs yet, but I see this as my only complaint, I really think 6 gigs is not enough. I have over 20 gigs in my personal collection right now, so there is NO WAY I'm going to be able to &quot;Take my whole CD collection with me&quot; as everyone says, but I can take a big chunk of it with me. I looked at some of the other devices (some which go up to 81gigs), but none of them had nearly the same feature set that the Nomad does. Plus I know and trust Creative. I knew with all the people complaining about not being able to scan tracks that it wouldn't take long for a firmware upgrade to come out to fix that, and by time I looked on their website it was already there!Price is not an issue. The Remote Solution 6 gig is still(much more), and it doesn't look anywhere as cool as this beauty. And it's lacking IR, and Line In recording.

The thing that bugs me the most of all is the digital (delayed) volume control. Volume should be controlled analog instead of 20 steps from almost silence to pretty loud. Another thing is the ugly font. Why is creative trying to make an 'original' font in a 6 x 7 cell block ? Some letters don't even match with the same font family. The transfer speed is okay, but a firewire was been more user friendly. The last pain is the price. For a simple OS, A USB connection and a 6GB notebook HD it is pretty expansive.

I've gone through my share of MP3 players, minidisc players, walkmans and discmans, but so far nothing has had the versatility that the Nomad Jukebox has. My problem is that whenever I travel I insist that I can't survive without bringing my entire CD collection, and it's annoying (and risky) to lug around that many CDs. Minidiscs provided a solution for a while, but it was to much hassle to spend so much time recording &amp; editing the minidiscs manually without the help of a computer program. MP3 players like the Rio 500 &amp; Nomad II are great for day use &amp; jogging, but most of the time 1 hour just doesn't cut it. MP3-CD players don't seem worth it to me because you still have to buy a CD burner &amp; carry around CDs. The Nomad Jukebox is for people who want a MASSIVE amount of music (6 GIGs, 100+ hours, which is 100x more than most Mp3 players, at around the same price) for use over a long period of time or at home.The Jukebox comes bundled with software for PlayCenter 2 (for the PC) or SoundJam (for Macs) to use for ripping CDs &amp; Mp3s from your computer to the Jukebox. It also comes with decent headphones (loudness is NOT a problem) &amp; a carrying case, plus all the necessary equipment for setting it up. Setup is pretty easy, and using the software is a lot more intuitive than I though it would be. It takes me around 5 minutes to rip a CD from my computer the the Nomad. The best feature by far is the OMD description searcher-- if you're online while your ripping CDs, the OMD finds the album name, year released, genre, artist, &amp; ALL the track names, so you don't have to type anything in. You can also rip Mp3s from the Nomad back to your computer. The songs in the Nomad can be categorized under Albums, Artists, Genres or Play Lists to make it easier to navigate. It supports data, mp3, wma, and wav files (plus many others). You can download updates [from the web] for better software or firmware for the player, so even if something isn't perfect now, in the future improvements will be available. The player also has an infrared port on the front for future additions (like a remote control). It comes with 2 hours of free music (mostly classical) and some Audio Books. It includes jacks for line-in recording from radios, microphones or stereos,  and line-out hookup to stereos or speakers.Of course, the Nomad Jukebox is a very new kind of Mp3 player, so it has a few MAJOR flaws:1) BATTERY POWER- Hard Drives tend to suck up an endless amount of power, and that's exactly what the Jukebox is-- a Hard Drive disguised as an Mp3 player. You can ONLY use the 4 rechargeable batteries that Nomad gives you (AA size) to run it without the AC adapter, and those only last around 2 hours by themselves. Nomad includes an extra set of 4 to replace them, but you always have to make sure they are fully charged. Maybe in the future there will be more options (battery pack?)2) WEIGHT - It's around the size of a first-generation CD player, and it weighs around 2 lbs with batteries. This isn't really a problem for me, but it depends what you want to use it for. It's not meant for use while jogging or biking, etc-- it's more for use over a long period of time away from home, on the bus/plane/dorm/in the car, or at home, plugged into the AC adapter and a pair of speakers. Besides the weight, in my opinion, it looks VERY nice- it has unique, smooth design, coloring and shape (and the LCD screen is easy to read).The Nomad Jukebox is the best in its category of high-capacity Mp3 players-- It holds 100 times more music than a normal Mp3 player, and its price has been drastically reduced, making it a lot more affordable than it was before. Overall, I am very satisfied with it. It is the best option for anyone who's ever wished they could bring all their CDs with them without actually having to CARRY them... and I think that I will be using it for a long, long time from now.",4.0,Nomad Jukebox - the best Mp3 player as of now...,988416000,"04 28, 2001",Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,1.0

I wanted an MP3 player that would hold a lot of music so I wouldn't have to keep running to my computer to transfer in new music every time I wanted to listen to something different. This unit does do that, but you pay a price for it. (1) The unit is awkwardly shaped, heavy, and rather bulky. I thought I could get used to this by telling myself that the unit would be like holding a portable CD player. Wrong! It weighs nearly a pound! What's worse is that this units shape makes it feel a little awkward to try to carry it in your hand. I always feel like I'm going to drop it because of it's weird, hard to grip oval shape covered with a slippery plastic case. I just don't enjoy walking around with this large heavy thing in my hand. (2) The battery life is one of its biggest drawbacks. You only get 3-4 hours of usage from a single charge! Talk about stressful! When I'm away from home I'm constantly worried it's going to die after running out of juice again and it leaves me searching for a place to charge it wherever I go. Making sure you always have extra charged batteries with you at all times just adds to the stress! I can't tell you how many times this thing has gone dead on me when I've been out and about. Listening to a portable music player should be fun and a relatively carefree process, and this thing just does not give me that kind of an experience. (3) It takes forever for this player to boot up and load the music! You have to sit and wait a couple minutes during this process before you can start doing anything with it! This is a real drawback if you are the type of person who would be turning it on and off through out the day to listen to a few tunes when you have a little bit of time on the go, like on your lunch break, in between classes or meetings, out doing quick errands, or using it in your car for numerous but short trip where you would have to shut it off upon arrival. This problem simply makes me not want to use this unit when I normally would with a standard MP3 player. I end up just leaving it my bag most the time if I know I'm not going to have a lot of time to listen to it, and with the size and weight issue I don't really enjoy hauling it around in my bag either since I already have enough to carry as it is. ***Basically, this unit was designed to be a stand alone MP3 player plugged into a wall with speakers plugged into it, NOT as a portable &quot;on the go&quot; music player -the unit is just too much of a hassle for it to be truly portable.",3.0,"Unit is too bulky, battery life sucks, &amp; OS too slow !!!",981504000,"02 7, 2001",Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,0.0

Most of these drawbacks have been noted by other reviewers, but a couple of them really need to be carefully considered by any prospective purchaser.Positives are many and widely noted already.  Capacity is very good a 6GB - but by no means limitless as some reviews claim.  If you are a big music buff who likes a lot of variety in the music at hand, you can fill this baby up as I have.  However, it beats every other alternative I've found and sure beats carrying 30 or 40 CDs on every business trip.  Sound is good.  Latest firmware upgrade solves a number of niggling ease-of-use issues.There are really only a couple of negatives, but they may be severe depending on what's driving your purchase.  First, assume you will need to pitch the headphones that come with the unit and replace them with something else.  Personally, I've used it with both Sony and Bose noise cancelling headphones and either, esp. the Bose, works great in combo with the Jukebox.  If you are an airplane traveller, this is the way to go.However, if you are an airplane listener, you run into the big drawback on this unit way too fast - battery life is ridiculously low.  I do a lot of transcontinental flying and go from LA to Europe about once a month.  My original reason for getting the unit was to save carrying CD player plus 2 or 3 dozen CDs all over Europe just for those 10 to 12 hour flights.  But even with two sets of the rechargable batteries, I can't even get half-way to Europe.  So I've really been unable to satisfy my original purpose in buying the unit.  It has been great in my office, where I can plug it in to electricity, playing out through a Bose Wave Radio and its fine on shorter flights.Overall a super device except for the crippling short life of its batteries.

There are two main complaints posted at Amazon.The first is the low battery life.  That is true.  You can get somewhere around 4 hours.  Keep in mind it comes with two sets of batteries, so if you carry both around you have  about 8 hours.  The reason for the low battery life is that you are running a hard drive!  If you mainly use this kind of thing at the home or in the car, there is a AC adapter and I believe Creative has just released a car kit.Another complaint is the loudness.  While it is not near soft, it is not quite as loud as a CD player usually achieves.  For me, however, it is usually not a problem.

When it comes to MP3 files, most companies out there don't seem to get the fact that anyone interested in MP3's need a LOT of space. This puppy has it. My entire collection is only 4 gigs, and I have a LOT of music.The sound is a little light. I bought better headphones than the ones included (didn't like the fit of those anyway) and now have a classic over the head set that is fine. Still could be louder, but as it is, people sitting next to me on the train can hear what I am listening to. So it plays fine.The error handling on the Nomad is a bit weak. It has no way to deal with corrupt files, and sometimes I get a load of new music and don't have time to listen to all the tracks and make sure they are full and complete before I am on my way out the door. So I have had to pull the batteries out just to reboot. It will totally freeze up when it hits a bad file. No way around it but to reboot, and the start up time is a bit on the long side.The battery life has been mentioned, but since my biggest use is between the house and the office, I just plug it in when I get to either, and it's ready for the ride back.These are seriously the ONLY complaints I can come up with. I ended up replacing the carry bag with a regular CD Player/CD case with a shoulder strap and enough space to keep the recharge cord with me. It's no havier than a CD player, I don't have to worry about skipping music if I move, and I have my entire music collection on my hip. That makes the good out weight the bad by a long shot.

Jean's biggest hits during the period covered by this box of five CD's (up to 1964) included A dear John letter (a #1 duet with Ferlin Husky), Forgive me John (a reply to the previous hit, also with Ferlin), A satisfied mind, Beautiful lies and Second fiddle to an old guitar. All other hits - indeed everything Jean recorded up to the end of 1964 - can also be found here.During this period, Jean was often overshadowed by two other country queens, Kitty and Patsy, but Jean played an important role in gaining recognition for female singers of country music. Jean often sang hard-hitting songs about relationships which would have feminists cheering her on (as Kitty also did, most famously with It wasn't God who made honky tonk angels), a great example being Two whoops and a holler. In this song, Jean demands to know why men can be unfaithful and it's OK, but if a woman does that, she's lower than a hound. Of course, that was the fifties and a few things have changed since then. Jean's feisty side is also evident on several other tracks here.The overall feel of the set is typical fifties honky-tonk country, including cover versions of songs made famous by Hank Williams, Lefty Frizzell, Jim Reeves and others - but there are not many songs here which are really famous. I was surprised at just how few such songs Jean recorded during this time.The best known songs here are I can't stop loving you, I love you because, You win again, Mockin' bird hill, If you've got the money I've got the time and I'm thinking tonight of my blue eyes (which has the same tune as Wild side of life and It wasn't god who made honky tonk angels), although you will recognise others.Jean has a lovely voice (described by another reviewer as a sweet but full-bodied alto - I can't improve on that), which I find to be much easier on the ear than Kitty's, while her music is much more firmly rooted in country than Patsy's. Jean is truly one of a kind - there will never be another like her.If you are thinking of buying this, you are obviously a huge fan of traditional country music, and you are probably familiar with Jean's music already. If you only want a little of Jean's music, there are other single-CD compilations that will satisfy your needs.",5.0,Fifties country music at it's finest,1028419200,"08 4, 2002",Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,1.0

I showed him the hidden space inside the hat and within about two minutes he was off showing everyone his new magic hat. He told his grandma see theres nothing in there and then waved his hand over the hat and said abera cadabera and pulled out the bunny. He was about 3 1/2 at the time and I was worried that he would be too young for the trick but he wasn't. He is now almost 5 and I just visited him a month ago and he still enjoyed showing me the hat trick. He even loved wearing the hat on his head and he was laughing the the whole time he played with the hat.

I like the 3 separate compartments, so I can keep my passport separate from credit cards and money.  I also like the mesh separation between the largest and middle sized pockets so I can quickly see what is in both at the same time.  I'm guessing that the other reason for mesh is for airflow.  The strap seems to be sewn well and will adjust to a length that you could tuck this into the top of your pants, which would make it a little more convenient to reach into it as if it was a pocket. I do wish that the plastic part that is used to adjust the strap bigger or smaller was less bulky.  There is no way it won't show under summer clothes. My only other complaint is that the pocket closure is velcro so it is really noisy when you are trying to ""quietly"" take out money or credit cards.

They have nice long straps which you can adjust.I figured out that the least conspicuous way to wear it was to let the straps all the way out, then put it over one shoulder, so that the pouch hung down at about hip level on the opposite side.  Almost like you'd wear a purse or a messenger bag. Then pull up your pants over the stash and put your shirt on and tuck it in over the stash too.That way, it basically sits between your front pocket and your back pocket in the middle of your side, but is completely inaccessible and virtually invisible there.  You have to pull up your shirt out of your pants to get to it, which provides excellent security.  You don't notice it there at all while walking around either.  It is good for your passport and credit cards, but you have to fold cash in half to fit in it, which will make it bulge a bit if you put like $300 or more in $20s in there.  So if you want to carry a lot of cash in this, get large denomination bills.Mine didn't get sweaty or nasty at all, it didn't really bother me at all and we did a LOT of walking around, several miles a day with no issues.  It is not amazingly well made, but is good enough that it should last a good while.My only complaint - I wish the little thing you use to adjust the strap length was a little bit smaller and low profile.

This particular waist stash is light and slim. It conforms to your body but it has two things that could be improved upon. The outer pocket's zipper broke on the second day of use. I now see on other reviews that it has happened to other folks as well. The second item that could be improved is the waist band itself. There should be some way to tuck in or pin up the excess waistband once you adjust it to your waist size. The excess just dangles or slips up underneath your clothing making it obvious that you are wearing a waist stash.

It has several pockets: making it easy to segregate cash, ID's and charge cards.  It has stood up to the rigors of travel very well - does not seem to stain (with sweat, for instance) easily, and looks as good as new, with no discernible wear.My concerns with the product are as follows:1) The neck cord is incredibly long.  It has an adjuster, but there is an awful lot of &#34;slack&#34; which hangs down my back.  I suppose I could cut the cord to make it shorter, perhaps knotting the ends, but doing so might increase the risk of losing the Stash, so I've not done so.  This is, at most, a minor inconvenience - and it makes sense for the manufacturer to make the cord long, &#34;just in case.&#34;  So, this has not affected my rating of the product.2) My other concern, and this is one that would be true of any such product, is that you cannot wear it under lighter weight fabrics without it showing, which to some extent defeats the purpose of it.

(Technically, neck wallets aren't a great idea, either: thieves have learned to look for them, and they can grab the neck strap, cut it, and run off very quickly. Caveat emptor.)The wallet is made from a nice, synthetic-feeling fabric. It's comfortable to wear, yet durable. It's bigger than you'd think from the picture - it'll hold most currencies without folding, so everything is nice and flat. There are four pockets that are as big as the entire wallet. I was kind of hoping for a card-sized pocket (for ID), but no. However, since there are two pockets accessed from the top (under the Velcro-closing flap), and two pockets accessed from zippers on either side, you have options on what to put where. Think about where you want to put things, and you should be able to pull this out, get what you need, and put it back under your shirt pretty quickly.So, I recommend this as a cheap, simple way of carrying things with some security, but keep in mind that it isn't perfect.

I originally put it around my neck and then positioned it under my t-shirt.  But once I cut my hair short, I didn't like the idea that the cord was visible at the back of my neck.  Seemed too easy for a thief to come close to me and cut the cord, so I started wearing it around my waist and tucked it inside my shorts.  Even though I am a size 16-18, I have no problem adjusting the cord to go around my waist.==========================================================Update:Just got back from my cruise around Italy and the stash worked very well.  I put the cord around my waist and tightened it up, then I slipped the pouch down the front of my pants and tucked the cord inside my waistband.  I don't think anyone could tell I had the pouch down my pants and I was careful to pull it out very discretely so as to not draw attention to it.  For example, I'd take out money when I was in the bathroom or in my transportation vehicle.My US Passport fit inside the pouch with room to spare, but the passport did make the pouch a little stiff, which wasn't as comfortable as without the passport in it.  I put my credit cards and seapass card into the zippered compartment on the side and my Euros into the long compartment going up and down. It didn't occur to me at the time, but I could have put the Euro coins into the other zippered compartment.For the trip from the airport to the hotel, and then the next day for trip from the hotel to the seaport, I wore two stashes - one on each side of my front.  I had brought extra dollar bills for tipping on the ship and I couldn't get everything into the one pouch.  The two pouches felt comfortable, but for the rest of the trip I only wore one pouchUsing this pouch allowed me to go out without my purse, which gave me a sense of security that I wouldn't lose everything if someone snatched my bag.

The costume is really cute, but not very durable.  The first time he wore it (for 2 hours) was fine.  He got some food on it so I had to wash it.  When it came out of the wash, part of the felt on the collar had ripped (although I washed on gentle cycle) and the unfinished seams in the sleeves were starting to unravel.  After the third wearing, the unfinished seams in the legs were unraveling too.  The crotch also started to pull at the seams, probably from my son crawling around.  Also, I was never able to get the mask to go on.  If you look carefully at the picture, the mask isn't actually attached.  I think they faked it as there's no way you can get this on a child that can reach and grab.  I debated putting the mask on him when he was sleeping, just to get a picture, but ended up not using it. So, for $15, you can get at least one wearing out of it and some nice pictures as long as you're not too hung up on the mask.  I was disappointed in the quality of the costume.

Mr. Antheil lived in Paris during the 1920s and there exists a photograph of him climbing the wall of the building he lived in (above the famous Shakespeare and Company). Since that time, I have gotten to know the music of George Antheil from the excellent recordings by Hugh Wolff, so I was interested inhearing more of his music.The two discs in this set were issued for the Antheil centennial and provide us with an intimate glimpse of the composer. Collected here are the only recordings Antheil made of his own music. The Valentine Waltzes are charming and sound a bit like the preludes of Dimitri Shostakovich, a comparison that has been made of Antheil's music. These are followed by asetting of Shelly fragments for voice and piano which was well performed but not necessarily a work that will be a favorite of mine. The orchestral works, the McKonkey Ferry Overture and Fifth Symphony are well played and are marvelous works. The symphony compares well with the recording by Hugh Wolff and the sound is quite good. The second CD starts of with Two Odesof John Keats for speaker and piano, with Mr. Antheil at the piano and Vincent Price as the speaker. This recording is probably of more interest for the participation of Vincent Price. The Odes are well performed and recorded but is also something I would not listen to very often. There isa short piece from a ballet called 'Capitol of the World' played and introduced by George Antheil. This is quite tantalizing and I wish I could hear more. Next, are four songs written for his son Peter in 1942, which Mr. Antheil recorded on his own 78-disc recorder. The quality of the recording is not very good but are clear enough. The songs are storieswritten for Peter and set to music; they offer a more intimate look at Mr. Antheil as he sings and accompanies himself on the piano. I am not sure if George Antheil even thought these recordings would be published; they are intimate and were obviously done with some fun in mind. There also is an interview with George Antheil from 1958, the year before his death, where he provides a complete and candid biography of himself.There are three tracks recorded on this CD that I have trouble justifying in this collection. Two are news items from the Second World War that Mr. Antheil recorded on his disc player, the last is a 20 minute interview with Hannah Adler and Norman Fox concerning the SPA record company that recorded the music on these discs. Since they do not directly concern Mr. Antheil's music I cannot justify their being here.This is an interesting set for someone who has a deep interest in George Antheil's music but I consider the three tracks I mentioned as a big drawback. I hope that record companies take a good look at George Antheil's music and record more of it. In this regard, I must note the Hugh Wolff has recorded1, 4, 5 and 6 of George Antheil's six. I hope to see the 2nd and 3rd someday.",4.0,An Interesting Recording Archive,1056672000,"06 27, 2003",Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,1.0

I'm in the Infantry and it's been through a lot of tough conditions and is still going strong. Still the original band, showing no signs of distress.  I replace the battery about every year and a half when the warning comes up.I LOVE the barometric pressure trend window on the face, let's me know at a glance if we're getting good weather or bad while out on a mission.  You will wonder how you ever got a long without it.The compass is surprisingly accurate if calibrated regularly and cross-checked against known points.  You can quick-access the compass by just pushing one button--great for getting a quick bearing while yr on the move, just make sure it's away from ferrous metals, of course.  Much faster than trying to pull out my real compass.  The bubble-level built into the face is great for that extra-level of accuracy that I've come to expect from Suunto.The altimeter isn't as dependable in my opinion.  But, Suunto makes it extremely easy to correct it to known elevation in about 3 seconds.  I typically reset it every morning when I know my elevation, but it deviates too much in my opinion throughout the day.It's also got the thermometer.  You can set it for metric or english units, but it's kind of a pain to do it.  (Suunto, it would be nice to make a one-touch button to switch back and forth.)  Oh, and obviously it does military time, too.Yes, it's a big watch, but the crystal is actually plastic, so it is extremely light and comfortable to wear.

What was most useful about it and why I would recommend this watch for hiking and walking in woods is alone for it's bottom right button on the default screen. When pushed the watch will go from time mode to compass mode for 5-10 seconds. Enough time to pull my map out of my pocket and orient it to north WHILE walking, drop my wrist (without pushing another button) and start pondering about where I am and have been on the trail, where I will get water, where I can camp. I can't stress how much time this saved me and how essential such a simple thoughtful function was. I lost myself on trial twice or three times, each time I realized before too much time had passed because of my Vector. I was walking in a direction the trail did not go and must have missed a turn. If I had to carry a compass in my pocket I would not have used it. I would have been lost and less engaged in hiking, it changed my style and made me a better hiker. It's a classic.Another useful function for the hiker is the alitmeter. If kept in tune to the contours on a map on a daily or bi-daily basis it was pretty very accurate and gave me peace of mind, helping me figure out a few times where I was and how much further on up or down I had to go to run across the trail or how many more miles I might expect to the next water source (which is HUGE in the desert).Buy this watch.

It's big, it's ugly, but has functions to make the fattest Swiss Army Knife sit in the corner sobbing in jealousy. Overall, I like it but there are a couple of things that sound better than they are.The timepiece: Outstanding. It has HH:MM:SS DD:MMM, of course, with a year setting to avoid leap year issues. This should go without saying in a modern digital watch. Stopwatch with lap function (not that I ever use the lap function, but I'm sure someone is interested). Countdown timer that can run up to a 24 hour countdown (very easy to set). Three daily alarms. Special kudos for the alarms, this is one of the loudest watch alarms I've heard, and I've missed too many watch alarms to not appreciate this.The Altimeter: largely eye candy, but kind of neat. Over four days, my bedroom went from 100m above sea level to 25 m below sea level (by the maps, about 40m ASL). Not surprising because it is driven by the barometer, and I never recalibrated it, but a graphic demonstration of the importance of calibrating it when you want/need it.The Barometer: Yup, it's a barometer. The part I like is the little display that shows the rising/falling trend, especially as this is always active (even in normal 'time' mode).The Thermometer: Take the watch off to get an accurate reading as the sensor is too close to the wrist.The compass: Easily the best 'special' feature. Accurate, precise (enough for orienteering, not for surveying), easy to use. It can be programmed for a declination, but knowing me, I'd forget to reset it, so I do declination the hard way. The sighting notches are small but servicable. The spirit level bubble is unique among digital watch compasses to Suunto, and greatly enhances accuracy and confidence in the compass. An outstanding wrist compass.The package: Big. Really, really big. But the controls are very easy to use and seem fairly resistant to accidental button pressing (a problem for me with other watches). The battery has a shortish (12-18 month) life, but has a hatch, so you don't need to take it to a jeweller to get it replaced without ruining the water resistance. The display has large characters and high contrast to the back ground, and the display light is just right, readible, even, and glare free, but not an emergency flashlight. Personally, I'm going to swap the resin band for a velcro strap, but the stock strap isn't bad, just not great.Overall, not a watch for the office or a suit but very good as a watch, compass and barometer, and about what you could expect as a thermometer and altimeter.

I'm in the Army and I thought this watch would be a great asset to have with me on the Medevac. I couldn't be more wrong than if I went into war with empty mags. The heart rate sensor worked only once and that was indoors with no sweat involved. The day I got it was the last day it ever worked. The compass, now that's an issue that that is unacceptable. It constantly quit regestering after walking only 10 feet. I was trying to be patient and give the piece of junk a minute to get it's bearing. It did, I think, I didn't have a second compass to verify at the moment in my yard. I walked a few feet in a strait line and once again it went blank.

It is not very durable.  It isn't even glass.  It's made out of VERY easily scratched plastic.  I own several watches, and even the plain glass face models scratch at the drop of a hat, but this one takes it to a whole new level.  I'd be worried to sneeze too close for fear it may implode.#2 is the fact that despite the promises of being water resistent to 100 Meters (ie 300 feet) this watch isn't...FAR from it.  You are in danger of ruining this watch if you even enter a bathroom while someone ELSE is taking a hot shower.  The humidity alone may cause problems.  Pretty sad when a watch advertised as at the very least capable in a pool cannot honestly pull off a basic shower in a bathtub.Now, with that said, if you take care to avoid moisture whenever you can, the Vector is a fine wrist computer that works quite well in a variety of areas.  It'll tell you the temperature (under the right circumstances, of course), help you predict the weather, give you a bearing on where you need to go and then (after proper adjusting) tell you your altitude.  I found the altimeter to actually be rather accurate -- oh, and those reviews I have read on-and-off by folks bragging about telling the altitude INSIDE of a pressurized passenger plane are BOGUS.Considering what this watch can do, and it's limitations, I believe that the price is a bit high (you can buy a Casio watch that'll do the same thing--and is solar-powered, AND is REALLY water-resistent, all for LESS) but the Vector has one thing that not all Suunto watches, or altimeter/barometer/compass watches come with: that little bubble on the face which allows a more accurate determination of specific readings.  If Casio add's one to their model, I'll probably become a full-time convert.  If you are looking for something similar, but smaller, try looking at the Suunto Observer.  It's a dang-good-looking watch, but the price is considerably more, so that may be a rather important factor for you (I know it is for me).All in all, Suunto makes great products, but water resistent models are unfortunately NOT one of them (unless you are going for one of their products that actually are designed for underwater use).",4.0,"Great watch that, despite promises, is NOT waterproof to 100m.",1175558400,"04 3, 2007",Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,1.0

I looked at the Casio watches and they just did not have the look I wanted, even though some were solar powered. Cool feature but you pay for it.I looked at the Suunto Core and X-lander as other possible buys, but at the time of purchase the Core was $250.00 and the X-lander was a little over $300.00. So I felt the Vector at $151.00 was the wise choice for me on value. It has the same offerings as the others.I also bought an extra battery, which comes in a kit with a new rubber gasket. Some folks have complained about the short life of the battery. But I believe this could be from excessive back lighting.Also, another concern is the size; yes it has a big watch body. I have medium size wrists I do not think it looks overwhelming for my wrist size. This brings another concern to light, the size of the glass and being subject to scratches. I feel that all watches have the potential to scratch; this watch invites more rigorous outdoor actives that could led to more wear.It takes a few minutes of reading the instructional booklet and you are up and running.

While many top racers wear it, I would highly recommend it for the serious hiker, climber or backcountry skier for it's solid construction, design and versatility.While I also wear this as my everyday watch, it's extra large size should be taken into consideration if that's something you have in mind.There are a couple other brands available in this market segment, but the relatively low price and exceptional feature set are what continues to set this tool apart from the crowd.Here's what you should know:* Expect to replace the battery at least once a year. This is due to a number of reasons, one of which is the powerful backlight on the face that when activated can nearly illuminate the inside of a small tent at night. If you believe the manufacturer's warnings and want to play it safe, you may want to have this procedure performed by a professional (watch, not outdoor) shop. Suunto sells a battery pack that comes with a replacement seal and screw-in back, and this is definitely something to consider every other replacement opportunity, but you can get by with a lower-cost Duracell type 2430 3V lithium if you're on a budget.* The altimeter is one of the strongest features, allowing you to quickly pinpoint your location on a topo map. However, plan to reset it regularly, especially after a plane ride or frequent and significant changes in altitude, or weather. This is rather easy as along as you have a confirmed location metric, but you have to remember to do it regularly to ensure the greatest accuracy. The 24-hour memory provides a total measurement of your ups and downs (ascents and descents) over that time period, a really cool record for runners, mountain bikers and skiers.* The compass is one of the strongest in this class of devices, which to be sure isn't the greatest to begin with ... but even the serious orienteerer would be impressed. The ability to adjust for local declination is really nice.* The barometer is good, but not great. However, if you want to be aware of potential weather changes, this will provide you with some peace of mind. Better to be safe than sorry (or worse) in this regard.* The thermometer isn't accurate at all unless you take the watch off for 15-20 minutes or so to eliminate the warming effect of your skin/body temperature.* Some of the controls and settings are not easy to comprehend or remember. I've never been able to figure out how to use the stopwatch, timer and lap features. If you're a swimmer or triathlete and this is important to you, look to the Timex Ironman standby.* Waterproofing is rock solid. No worries.* The soft-rubber watchband is comfortable to wear, but will deteriorate over time, even more rapidly in chlorine. Suunto offers a much lighter nylon/velcro alternative that I personally prefer.Overall, I really like the Vector. But for a number of reasons already mentioned, would not feel comfortable giving it a perfect 5.0 score. But consider my 4.0 more like a 4.7 ... you can't go wrong here.",4.0,"Essential tool for serious hiker, climber, adventure racer",1108944000,"02 21, 2005",Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,1.0

It's not just a fun gadget, it's a tool that I will never trek without. My friends and I do long, often trailless hauls over high mountain terrain. We often navigate long distances relying heavily on topo maps and compass. (I'm not talking Central Park; I'm talking vast stretches of Cascade and Canadian wilderness.) This watch has become a tool that I constantly use: the barometer to keep a sense of changing weather, the altimeter to validate my assumptions about topography, the compass as a backup in case my main compass dies (this happened), the thermometer to see how cold the morning is, and of course the time.Some things you should know: It's big, so treat this watch only as something you wear while doing outdoor sports. The thermometer is only useful when you're not wearing it, so expect only to know the temperature first thing in the morning (or expect to take it off and let it sit for about 10 minutes). The battery lasts for about a year (backlight use minimal).In sum: This watch should be on your wrist if and when you do serious outdoor sports such as distance mountain trekking. This watch should NOT be on your wrist if you think that mountain trekking means walking along a lovely gravel-lined trail at a nearby national park.Final Note: Since I bought mine, Suunto has come out with several variations on the same watch.

This is to be expected as it uses more power than the other functions (but it does have auto-off in the compass mode after a time to save energy).  There is no bubble level on this model as it has a mineral crystal glass instead of the usual plastic.  I have knocked this watch so many times against things and there are many surface 'threads' you can see given the right light, but no truly visible damage, like big gouges or cracks like the plastic would show.  The logbook feature is a great asset.  Based on a rolling record (oldest record deleted when the memory becomes full), the logbook records Altitude and can be set to different sample rates (e.g. depending on whether you are walking, climbing, driving, etc.) and includes a record of greatest height.  The logbook cannot be deleted (but as stated records over itself) but the max height can be reset independantly.  The backlight is a little dim, but fine to keep your night vision, and the temperature does not compensate for being on or off your wrist (like some Casio models can).  For a large watch (you won't lose it!) it is quite lightweight, with an aluminium case and carbon shell it also looks great.  The new Ti models do not have the same clarity of display though so I would say stick to this screen size, but maybe get the heart rate monitor (HRM) model if you also exercise (cycle, etc) - it's only a small premium and it *is* a Polar model!  I imagine the batteries might last less time due to the HRM receiver, but this at least is user-serviceable (and retains the watches environmental integrity, unlike changing a Casio battery).  The only sad thing is the screenprinted/anodised(?) graphics for the points of the compass rose are wearing off - Suunto take note, laser etch/engrave them next time!!  Sighting grooves in the bezel would be useful too, for taking bearings, but at least the bezel stays smooth as silk on this model as it has ball bearing detents rather than the friction-based ring the plastic housings have which stiffen up so you can't use them.A few minor details aside (like a strap not long enough to go over your coat - just get an velcro Animal strap - and the print wearing off, and maybe the price), this is a cracking product, rated up there with the Garmin eTrex Legend GPS :-)If you want a barometer, altimeter, compass, thermo &amp; HRM in a decent, reliable, user-friendly package, this is it!",4.0,"Reliable, rugged, clear and easy to use",1044835200,"02 10, 2003",Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,1.0

First of all the visibility of the display is much too dark.  The images of the X-Lander on the Amazon and Suunto websites have been enhanced to the point that a case could be made for false advertising.  Secondly, the instructions to set the numeric values (meters vs feet, etc.) aren't even covered in the instructions that come with the watch, you have to download the full set of instructions to figure that out, then some of the fields used to set the values are so small and located in such bizarre locations, that even with 20/20 vision, I had to use an illuminated magnifying glass to see, then set the values.  Thirdly, the backlight feature is useless in low light or bright daylight.  It is only good for pitch black darkness...much too dim, but is probably the same as their military version, which has to be at a low level to keep the wearer from getting shot!  Fourth, (probably for the same reason) the alarm is not loud enough, especially if you are wearing the X-Lander under a couple of layers of clothing.  As others have stated, it should not be counted upon as a means to wake you from sleep.  Fifth, the barometric trend indicator is totally unreadable...too small and too dim to see under normal circumstances unless you also happen to be carrying a small foldout magnifying glass (which, as it turns out, I do carry while trekking).  Finally, the feature navigation is not intuitive, meaning if you do not use the features and sub-features regularly, good luck with remembering how some of the functions are accessed, and turned on and off, unless you carry the instructions on your person.I am going to keep this &#34;wrist computer&#34; for trekking, but it will not be the watch on my wrist for everyday casual use.

Because of that, there should be a way to shut off the X-Lander (short of removing the battery) so the battery does not run down while it's in the safe...still hoping to find out how to do that...doesn't have a stem to pull out like a watch.I can not recommend the X-Lander.

It is a little pricier than some of the competition from Casio and Timex. However, it offers some nice advantages over most others, with only a couple drawbacks. I wore mine for two tours in Iraq and it performed perfectly. Not that I truly ever relied on the Comp-Baro-Alti features, because we always had other more advanced devices for that. But it was reassuring to have those capabilities on my wrist at all times. And the basic time, stopwatch, alarm and timer functions were used often and performed well.Pros:User replaceable battery - very helpful in the field and easy to do, saves money.Broad array of functions - easy to manipulate the various features with a little practice and reading the manual.Very accurate - the watch loses very little time over the months and years, good quartz movement.Good water resistance - not a dive watch, but it holds up well, even under several meters of water, which I've done.Comfortable despite its large size - pretty light weight and a large, comfortable band.Easy to read - large face, big numbers.Attractive design - very distinct look.Cons:Not solar-atomic (like Casio Pathfinder) - however, battery is easily replaced and the quartz movement is very accurate.Thicker case - more so than the Casio PAW1300, but not too bad.Bottonology - the button function layout is different than most Timex and Casios, but isn't too hard to figure out.Price - higher than many, but not excessive for what you get.Overall, despite the drawbacks referenced above, I highly recommend the Suunto X-Lander and I would assume the other Suunto models are also good.

What I really love about the X-Lander is that it is big but also very light-weight.  Normally when you see a wrist watch this large you have to exercise your arm quite a bit just to get used to telling time, but not so with the X-Lander.  And best of all: it does WAY MORE than just tell time!Interested in knowing where you are going?  How about the current temperature?  Are you just the slightest bit interested in what your current altitude may be?  GO BUY THIS WATCH!  'Course for those Suunto enthusiasts, this ISN'T a watch, its a Wristop Computer that just so happens to be able to tell time.  Unlike the Suunto Observer which is about half the size (and more than a little extra spendy), this baby will do all that and still look great doing it.  From the 3 different Suunto models I personally own, I must admit that they make a great wristop computer, or for the picky out there, watch.  I mostly use mine to tell simple time, but I must say that as I drive over the mountains up to Montana or over to Oregon and Washington, it IS handy to know a few extra details just by looking down at my wrist.  Oh, I almost forgot the barometer!  It tracks the barometric pressure and helps you track and even predict the weather!  I must say that I haven't been able to figure out the finer points of how to do that just yet, but I AM working on it.I guess if I HAD to point out one flaw, I would say that the night-glo feature it comes with isn't all that bright, and the alarm could stand to be louder -- but it IS about 5 TIMES more audible than the absolutely embarassing alarm built into the Observer.  Other than these minor complaints, I whole-heartedly endorse pretty much everything manufactured by Suunto, and especially the models I own, the X6HR, The Observer and of course the X-Lander.

While the Observer is a more updated model they both share very similiar features and ease of operation.My first recommendation is that you do order this from amazon.com and be wary of the same item offered by ""market place sellers"".  At the time I initially placed the order amazon.com was out and the wait was estimated to be 3 to 5 weeks.  Since the item was also offered by another seller in amazon's referral system I placed an order and wound up with the wrong watch; turns out the market place seller didn't carry the black face model.  Fortunately amazon got a supply in and shipped my watch within 24 hours....good service.  The black face is a little hard to come by.Now then, to the watch itself.  First of all it IS big...but very light; almost as light as the titanium Observer I have.  The larger face makes it easier to read and Suunto has apparently gone back to the leather (waterproof) band, which I prefer.  Functionally, the watch is a full blown time keeper and (non GPS) navigation system including stop watch/chronometer functions, an accurate altimeter, a barometer and digital compass.  Both the compass and the altimeter are as accurate as I've found in analog portable units.  The alarms are sufficiently loud (unlike the only chink in the Observer) and my only criticism is that the back light is weak compared to the Observer, but that fault doesn't draw anything away from the 5 star rating.  Add the user replaceable battery (Suunto makes a kit that includes the battery, a water/dust seal and a new cap), the intuitive operating system and you have the ultimate back country time piece.Suunto was the first to offer this type of time piece and, in my opinion, still offers the best.

This watch carries a statement that you are more practical than flashy, but not in a cheap way that other watches seem to portray. Second, it has several practical tools. It has a built-in digital compass, barometer, and altimeter. I haven't stress tested it, but it is fairly accurate after calibration. (You should read the manual). The compass is a bit sensitive to distortion from other metals/electronics, so best be careful and check twice. Third, it has a good weight, not too heavy, but not too light that I feel it's fragile. I've bumped it against several tables and surfaces but so far has held up quite well.On the negative side, first, it's a bit on the pricier side than a Timex or a G-Shock, but you are paying to differentiate. The Suunto brand name and the black-face watch design definitely stop G-Shock fans to ask what this watch is. Additionally, the Suunto core just doesn't carry the same feel. If you compare these side-by-side, this is bolder, hands down. Second, the wrist band is a bit hard to use. Once I put it on, it's difficult to take off. Not sure if any other owners have the same issue. Maybe this is why there are so many Suunto X-lander wrist bands for sale? When frustrated, it is hard to control the desire to rip it off your wrist.In summary, a great watch for functionality and style. It is THE watch to have if you are out in the wilderness or if GPS goes down.

I haven't had to change it beyond switching timezones.The compass is quite accurate. Within a degree or two.Watch is surprisingly light for how big it is.It has a back light option, quite nice. Automatic turnoff after 4-5 secondsIt has a very clear crystal. Do yourself a favor and get a protector for it. They're 2 bucks on EBAY and protects it. Also reduces the glare from the crystal.ConsThe battery life for this is pretty short. Expect to get a year give or take a few months depending on your backlight/compass use However, its easy to replace, takes 30 seconds to do.I found the altimeter/barometer pretty sketchy. The altimeter might vary 30-40 feet while sitting in the same place over night, I don't rely on it.The barometric indicator on the top let is quite difficult to see but halfway decent if you want to know if a storm is letting up.The temperature function is accurate but flawed. The sensor sits right on your skin, so it picks up your body temperature. Take it off and let it set for a half-hour or so to get a accurate reading.The finish on the metal is lame to say the least. It scratches quite easily. Scratched on wood surface, changing out the strapsI haven't tested how waterproof it beyond washing my hands and the occasional rainstorm. Its been fine for thatThe You can see the numbers in good light, but it can be tough in low light (hence a backlight) but if that bothers you, don't get the all-black one.It isn't a very ""intuitive"" watch. You need to read the directions to use all the functions. After that, its greatNow for the cost. Its expensive compared to some other ABC watches (timex's and casio's) but it is much better looking. Unless you like sci-fi looking stuff, then get the Timex. If you want a more ""accurate"" Suunto, get the Core. It has better sensors but if you want toughness, get this.Since cost is always relative, I like having the ability to have a great looking watch that keeps accurate time and compass measurements. For me, these were the main things I was looking for, the altimeter and barometer were secondary.If you were wanting those two, you will be better off looking elsewhereGreat cheaper alternatives to this:5.11 field ops (nice compass, timekeeping, shooting calibration functions)Casio pathfinderTimex ws4",3.0,This watch sits between OK and great,1366848000,"04 25, 2013",Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,0.0

Rosewarne,"[0, 0]","This watch was great while it lasted, but be warned, the bezel will fall off and SURPRISE it turns out that this is not covered under the warranty. Designed in Finland, but made in China and it shows and it is clear to me exactly why it is not covered under the warranty.I should have known better from the start since 30M water resistance on something that is being marketed as 'military' is a joke. Military in this instance just refers to the black coloring/cosmetics and only serves to support the fashion aspect of it as some kind of mil-spec piece of equipment, which I can assure you it is not. I have dive watches, so this wouldn't have been used in the water that way and so I purchased it anyway......much to my dismay.The watch was decent while it lasted, it just didn't last that long. So much for Suunto 'sports' watches. Their image as a maker of high quality outdoor gear type stuff is all just a marketing ploy and has no real basis in their products or their support for their products. They are just big fashion accessories for people that want to look outdoorsy.I snowboard, mountain bike, dive, windsurf, trek, surf, climb, camp and pretty much do everything you can do outdoors and so when it came time to get a new watch, a Suunto was an obvious option. At $350 the X-Lander Military seemed it would be a ruggedly built watch and be able to stand up to that kind of use pretty well. Wrong.The first thing that went after about 4 mos. was the loop part of the watch band that holds down the extra strap portion when it is on your wrist, so that it was always sticking up. Rather than buying a new band, I just started using my girlfriend's black hairband/rubber bands for that and it worked better than the original part. The band that comes with this watch is just cheap plastic, plan on getting a different one if you buy the watch. I wish I had just returned the watch at that point.I typically only used the watch when doing stuff outdoors b/c it is too bulky for regular daily wear, so I imagine it was used maybe 50-60 days in a little under 2 years. One day, while not doing anything too taxing (driving actually), the face bezel just falls off. I snap it back on and was thankful that it didn't come off and get lost. The next time it came off, it did get lost.No problem, I assume that Suunto would have an adequate warranty and being used to dealing with companies like North Face, Patagonia and REI all the time, I assumed they would stand by their product. Wrong again. Suunto is NOT like that.I called Suunto and was informed that the warranty DOES NOT COVER the face bezel falling off. Huh? The customer service rep informs me that these are connected when they leave the factory and therefore not covered b/c they are not supposed to come off (I responded with 'that much we can agree on, they should not come off). He then goes on to tell me that it will be at least $90 to send it to them to fix it, because they have to also replace the inner metal casing part of the face. Again, huh? $90 for what would be about $7 (if that, they make the damn things after all) in parts and perhaps 30 minutes of labor? Are you kidding me?I bought a Tag Heuer Kirium watch back in 1999 and I took that everywhere and did EVERYTHING with it for years, including diving and that included a 2 year stint backpacking throughout South America and all manner of outdoor adventures and that thing has never skipped a beat. Ever. And it isn't even a sports watch AND I still wear it constantly for regular use.I told Suunto customer service person there is no way I'm going to waste $90 fixing what turns out to be just a BIG WATCH fashion accessory when they can't even guarantee me the bezel won't just fall off again and will just leave it in the gear bag as a semi-functioning backup.They won't post my review on their website for obvious reasons, so that should tell you a lot about how much they care about their customers right there.",1.0,"Initially a great watch, until it fell apart that is",1392768000,"02 19, 2014",Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,0.0

Skiing, hiking, trekking, snorkeling, running. It's great. I bought an X-Lander just for the metal case, but if it wasn't around, I'd get another Vector. After all that time, the only things wrong were that the liquid in the face bubble evaporated (it was there until two years ago)and the bezel compass markings have worn a bit.The X-Lander is just very cool looking with the metal case, a better rubber wristband, wider and a better keeper. I think this has taken the Vector's place as my favorite. The functions are identical and I know the settings already.However, THIS IS NOT FOR ACTIVE DUTY PERSONNEL OR ANYONE IN THE FIELD FOR LONG PERIODS. I was in Costa Rica for a week, and used insect repellant daily. The repellant softened the plastic of the battery to the point where the impressed lettering wore away and I could scratch the surface with my fingernail. The rest of the case and the strap were fine. I called Suunto about it and they told me that the manual says not to expose the watch to chemicals. I replied that soldiers and Marines use insect repellant much of the time, and that they should make the cover from Aluminum as they do the case. Apparently, this fell on deaf ears. They are sending me a replacement cover. I noticed in their accessories that they sell replacement covers, which are also available on Amazon here, so this seems to be their solution. But the case and plastic strap were not at all affected, just the battery cover. So, caveat emptor if you're going into jungle with mosquitoes around.My old Vector goes to my daughter.Amazon is my favorite vendor hands down. However, I would look at EMS for this watch.

A few months after the band broke, the compass stopped functioning; I'm not sure how sitting on my desk caused the compass to stop working correctly, but there you have it. I have spoken to other Suunto owners who have had the same issue with the compass function.I have owned Casio Pathfinder watches in the past, and they have been FAR superior in regards to both longevity, reliability, and ease of use. My last one survived 5 yrs of hard use (scuba diving, surfing, mountains and deserts...) before giving up the ghost. And it cost about half of what the Suunto cost me. I thought I would try a different brand, but the Suunto survived less than a year of light/no use, no submersion or impacts.

And I am certainly not satisfied.Suunto offer Global Support. That, without any exaggeration, means they can receive e.mails from anywhere on the planet you can send one. Unfortunately it means nothing more than that. At all.To the watch itself. A really pleasant surprise from my wife. A great looking watch. That after six to seven days I started to question the clarity of the display. To try keep my complaint down to a short rant, the screen started to fade. The display was sketchy and rapidly worsened. It was winter in Vermont so nothing to do with exposure. Whilst in the UK I arranged for the free courier collection, back to Suunto. The alarm bells sounded when I explained to the courier company what I thought was an unusual request ' collect my watch from my house for repair under warranty' "" not a problem sir, we get many of these every day"" What?????!The watch was returned and around week six, the screen started to fade again. I contacted ""Global Service"", but because I was now living in New Zealand they would not pay courier fees. For an unquestioned, faulty watch, still under warranty. Because I was not in the country the watch was purchased in. Which was online, from a store in the USA while my wife was in Antigua. If I may remind you, they took it back from the nearby UK!The e.mails went back and forth, and I kept my cool the entire time. Suunto offered me a new screen. Shipping at my cost. No assurance that it would not happen again. But up until the warranty runs out, I could send back, at my expense, as often as I liked. Well, that wouldn't be so bad. The watch fails on average every four weeks and shipping, repairs and return shipping mean I should only be sending the watch back four or five times a year. 'Well I will tell you what'  write Suunto, ' we will give you a ""Core"" model watch in exchange'.Let me get this straight, you can't fix my watch with any assurance it will last but you will give me a watch with a lower retail value in exchange, hmmm, tempting? But I have done some research online and about the only thing worse than owning a Suunto X-Lander is owning a Suunto Core!

I failed to mention that if your watch has a very very small viewing angle, your likely in for a disappointment. Suunto said that they would repair my watch and make me happy. That probably only took six months and I have also added a warranty claim for the watch strap splitting on every hole punched in the strap while I have been waiting.The watch was returned. Suunto wouldn't correspond during the two months it took to receive the watch back. And just quietly, I actually hoped that it had been lost in shipping so that I could have the insurance instead.

Since I purchased through Eastern Mountain Sports, their 'Unconditional Satisfaction' return policy allowed me to replace failed X6s, um, three times.  But, and reasonably so, after the 3rd failure, EMS said they would only give me credit toward a the Military version of the X-Lander or a final cash refund.  Why the Military version of the X-Lander? Because it is the ONLY Suunto 'Wrist Computer' to feature the same button design as their dive computers. In other words....take any other type of Suunto watch into the wild and you risk losing all functions.Let me be clear: I backpack, I hike, I mountain bike, and I sea kayak...all activities that expose you to water, be it ocean, lake, river, a down pour or three days of drizzle.  I'm careful with my gear. But the non dive button models still crapped out.  SUUNTO even says that their watches are 'Water RESISTANT' to certain depth...but if you press anything while exposed to water (and in my case, twice this was just being out in the mountains in the rain), you are at fault and Suunto will not handle any warranty work.My advice is to buy the X-Lander Military version and learn to deal with its display and programming quirks.And buy from shops that have an Unconditional Satisfaction return policy that extends for quite some time.Sending a watch to Suunto USA for repair takes months and is expensive...and you can roll the dice to guess if they actually worked on your watch.Why buy a Suunto?  Their altimeter & barometer functions are spot on and far easier to calibrate. The watch senses your motion and will re-set between alt and baro functions so that you get an accurate reading (and an alarm) when you NEED one.

Smooth alloy, black matt plastic, mineral crystal glass and an excellent band make it an unusual looking watch and it's comfortable to wear. The dial read out is BIG and very clear.

The buttons are not marked on the watch (anywhere) so you need to remember the sequences but again it's not that hard. The temperature read out is not correct when you are wearing the watch (it's about 4c higher) but it quickly moves down when taken off. All the other features appear to work well.

The baro and compass features are cool, although I don't use them that much.I find it odd that in ""Time"" mode it doesn't show the seconds digitally, instead preferring to show the day of week, month, and day of month.  You can get it to show seconds by pressing one of the unlabelled and not particularly intuitive buttons, but only for ten seconds, then it's back to the day (or date, I can't remember which).  I generally want to know seconds, not what month it is, on the race course.  There is a 36 element ring that does some stuff as seconds elapse but it isn't easy to read at a glance.The countdown timer is odd too.  There is no repeat mode, which I used to set to five minutes and just let roll during starting sequences.  Instead there is a one shot timer that, once started, it seems that no force in the universe can reset, although you can get it to jump (either up or down, I can't remember which) by pressing one of the buttons.Finally, I am reasonably intelligent but I'm no good at this thing's interface.  Navigating through functions involves pressing one of three buttons either once, twice in two seconds, or holding it down for two seconds.  There doesn't seem to be much rhyme or reason to when you do what.In all, I'm disappointed with the lack of flexibility for displaying the time (you'd think they could splurge for a six digit display for the time, it is a watch, after all).

Picked this up in order to give my Omega Seamaster a break (needs to be sent back to switzerland to get polished up). This watch is big, but very, very light. At the store where I picked mine up, I had the Seamaster in one hand and the Yachtsman in the other. The Yachtsman has probably twice the mass, but less than half the weight. It is good looking, and will be a conversation piece when worn with a suit at business meetings.The good: Time, stopwatch, barometer, thermometer, compass, and race timer. The race timer is essentially a countdown (you synchronize with race committee gunshots) followed by a stopwatch, with split time viewing and one-race memory. A couple good features: it can only be stopped by hitting the stop button twice in two seconds - good for those of you that wear sailing gloves. Beeps are audible unless the wind is howling above 20 knots. If you aren't a racer, you might do just as well with the x-lander, which excludes the racing timer but includes an altimeter, all within the same aesthetic package. The barometer includes a 1 hour interval memory (remember, 3 mbar change in under an hour and you're probably in trouble) and a thermometer. All units can be changed between imperial and metric. I haven't changed the battery yet but the compartment is opened with a coin, and looks very easy. Also, its a great looking watch if you can pull off the large size, and its relatively inexpensive.The bad: The contrast could be a little darker, and the backlight could be a little brighter. No seconds display on the standard time view. You can toggle seconds display briefly via pushing a button. Reading the manual (twice or three times) is an absolute must, because the buttons are unmarked. The thermometer doesn't take accurate readings while strapped on due to the heat from your wrist. The compass reading is a little jumpy (though in my experience, accurate).

Point being that Chopin and Balakirev are in the same orbit as Franck and Faur&eacute;.  And they all share a penchant for large piano pieces in the stylized genres of nocturne, waltz, scherzo, mazurka, fantasy and the like.  Balakirev's music is surely no less cosmopolitian than Franck's; and like Chopin, Faur&eacute;, and Scriabin, Balakirev favours unusual key-colours with many sharps or flats.Balakirev may perhaps be considered as a synthesis of Chopin and Scriabin.Malcolm Binns is an eclectic artist who has made Balakirev something of a specialty.For this recital, Binns presents a good selection of Balakirev's significant and representative works.Featured here are two of Balakirev's three Scherzi--No. 2 in bb-minor (1900) and No. 3 in f#-minor (1901), each very sophisticated of ~:07mins duration.The very lyrical 7th Mazurka in the remote key of eb-minor is ~:08mins of choice salon art-nouveau.The great bb-minor Sonata (1905) of 1/2hour's duration is Balakirev's most significant piano work after the brilliantly twisted Oriental Fantasy, Islamey (Db-major, ~:08mins duration).The Sonata is comprised of four movements:I): Andantino--descriptive Russian polyphony;II): Mazurka--a transcription of his 5th Mazurka;III): Intermezzo--lyrical Jugendstil;IV): Allegro--bravura tour de force featuring the Trepak.This satisfying programme is interspersed with three charming character pieces: the Gondolied, the Berceuse, and the Lark.See too:Balakirev: Piano Music (Complete) [Box Set]Balakirev: Piano Music (Complete) [Box Set]Balakirev and Mussorgsky: Piano MusicBalakirev and Russian FolksongBalakirev: Symphony No. 1; Islamey; TamaraBalakirev: Symphony No. 2; RussiaBalakirev: Piano Concertos No. 1 in F-Sharp Minor and No. 2 in E-Flat Major / Rimsky-Korsakov: Piano Concerto in C-Sharp MinorRussian Piano MusicMily Alexeyevich Balakirev: Piano Music, Volume 1Balakirev: Piano Music.",5.0,Mily BALAKIREV: Resourceful Russian...,1210032000,"05 6, 2008",Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,1.0

My old one was already getting kind of worn and I needed one that would last me through all four years. Alas, the Big Student is exactly that kind of pack. It is big, rugged, and well organized with lots of pockets and compartments to hold all of your stuff.The pack is divided into two main compartments. The bigger one is very roomy and that's where I keep all of my binders and my textbooks, while the smaller one is where I keep my spiral notebooks, organizers, and datebooks. There is also a compartment sewn onto the smaller compartment and is where I keep my tissues and other knick knacks.The two smaller pockets on the front are wonderful! I don't know where I would be without them! The smaller one has lots of small pockets on the inside, where I can store all of my pens, pencils, and other supplies. There's even a cell phone pocket and a keyper, a key loop, for all of your keys so that you don't lose them. The smaller front accessory cargo pocket is divided into two sections and that's where I keep my wallet and other valuable stuff.The shoulder straps are very well padded and can adjust to any height. I think that they work great when you are carrying one of those heavy loads. The back is also padded so that you don't get poked in the back by any bulky textbooks.Plus, the YKK zippers work very well and the seams have not even begun to split.Because this pack can hold a lot of stuff, it can sometimes make me look like a nerd, but that's okay. I really don't mind that because I get everything organized and because th pack is very comfortable when you carry it.Not only is this pack big, rugged, and holds a lot but it also comes with a lifetime warranty from JanSport which says that if you find anything wrong with your Big Student, you can send it back to them and they will send you a new. Just make sure that you keep the slip that comes with the box.I don't know where I would be without this pack. It's got lots of room, keeps all of your stuff organized so you can find it when you need it, and it holds up well in all kinds of weather because the flaps over the zippers act as rain guards and protect your stuff from getting wet.If you're an organization [person] like me and you need a pack that can hold up in all kinds of weather, then get the Big Student.

Nothing fancy, but also nothing weird. I'm about 5'8&#34;, and the sleeves don't come all the way to my wrists. The length on me is similar to the picture.The veil is the part that's a bit odd. The black part is the same material as the dress-that's fine. The white part is also polyester but the headband part is padded. There's velcro on either side to hold the lame phrase bands, but if you're not using them you could cover the exposed velcro squares with the black veil, but it's not ideal. Would have been nice if they could just leave that out. There are these two weird black elastic bands at the end of the white padded part that are about 2 inches long. There's no obvious reason for them. I can only think that it's a left over from another costume design. I will have to use bobby pins  and/or rig some sort of head band to keep the veil in place. The inside of the white padded band came dirty on mine. It's hidden while I wear it, so I'm not returning it because it's too much of a hassle just a few weeks from Halloween.The white head, neck, shoulder covering is just ok. I'd like it to have a bit more weight for it to lie properly, but I won't be using this piece anyway. I've order a separate white peter pan collar to attach to the black dress, so that I can look more like Miss Clavel in the Madeline books.",3.0,Good enough for a quick Halloween costume,1381795200,"10 15, 2013",Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,0.0

People wanted their pictures taken with me!!! It was hilarious! I didn't use the silly phrases that comes with this costume which you can place (Velcro) on the white crown piece though, that's just not my style. My boyfriend wore the Wandering Gunman costume and I was obviously Sister Sarah (re the Clint Eastwood &#34;Fistful of Dollars&#34; series). That being said, this costume is easy to put on. You can wear street clothes underneath (I wore all black under mine) and not be overheated with the costume over it because it is very thin fabric. I read reviews on this before I bought it and some people had trouble with the head pieces staying in place. Not so with mine. I just pulled all my long hair back in a pony tail and put everything on and it stayed in place all night long. We went out to a club after the party and I even sang on stage (my friend was performing and asked me to sing with him)! The audience was pretty quiet at first, thinking I was a REAL nun!!! Lots of funny looks in the car driving around, too!!! HILARIOUS!!! I would recommend this costume to anyone.

I was not sure which I was going to be and also, I figured, it would not hurt to have an extra costume on hand in case another friend was out of ideas and needed something to wear.Well, I received both less than a few days apart.  At a small party with my closest friends, I tried on both and the overwhelming response was to wear this one.I can gratifyingly say IT WAS A VERY BIG HIT at all of the parties I attended that night.  I went to four different Halloween parties and had my picture taken at least 50 times as the night progressed.I wore it plain, as it does come with some funny headbands (NUN FOR YOU, NUN OF YOUR BUSINESS etc.).  I also enhanced it with a set of rosary beads and a cross I had gotten from my grandmother.The costume is very light, so it is excellent to wear over regular clothing.  This way, if you want to go to the party and put it on at the last minute you can do so with ease.That being said, the material is of sheer nylon (no, you cannot see through it) and the headdress is easy to take on and off.  It appears to be machine washable, but because I wore regular clothing underneath it the one night that I wore it, I simply hung it outside for a few hours to get all of the cigarette smoke (the parties I went to were at four bars in the same neighborhood (Itaewon, Seoul, South Korea) within walking distance of where I was staying) out of it.It looks very authentic and I would highly recommend purchasing it if you do not intent to wear it often.",5.0,A big hit!!!!,1323129600,"12 6, 2011",Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,1.0

I would not get this to wear around except on dive trips.I've owned one for almost two years and the best feature I can think of is that its very simple to use.  It takes care of all the administive details for you.  Depth, dynamically keeps recalculating how much time you have left at your current depth, safety stop timer, when you're topside it keeps track of your surface intervals and refactors for your next dive.  No flying warnings appear as appropriate.It made me a more aware diver.  When I started using it, I noticed it kept beeping at me telling me I was ascending too fast or descending too fast - ie breaking rules.  It was annoying at first but the sad fact was that I was breaking rules and didn't even know it and I was putting myself in a higher risk category.  I paid attention to the warnings and I think I'm safer for it.  Now my Suunto doesn't beep much when I dive.The algorithm it uses is very conservative so I'm comfortable.It is not air integrated so you still have to look at your pressure guages.  But if you rent your equipment or you're a new diver, this is the first thing to buy (literally buy it with your mask, fins, snorkle, and wetsuit) before you start going out for regulators or BCDs and stuff like that.

Its especially useful for multiday dive trips where you're renting gear every day...it keeps track of your no fly times which on long dive trips can extend more than 12 hours so the computer tells you when not to fly.Titanium is very light.  I use the plastic strap mostly because its easier to put on and off with a dive suit.  The Titanium strap looks cool though.  I generally don't wear it as a watch...its huge and you can tell its a dive computer - if you're 6'5"" maybe you can use it as a watch.  I do wear it on diving vacations though as my primary.It has a bunch of features too nitrox mixes, dive planning, and a whole bunch of other stuff.An interesting thing is that if you break too many rules or do something that puts you in a higher risk of microbubbles and things like that, it will give you warnings telling you not to dive.  I received one of those infractions once.  Consider it your diving police officer.

We figure it is about 25-30 years old now and it has been an outstanding watch. It's extremely simple to use yet provides the essential features of a digital watch (timer, chrono, alarm, date and, of course, time) and is extraordinarily reliable in whatever conditions you throw its way (did a variety of construction and landscaping jobs with it, automotive work, light scuba diving as well as other sports, and just everyday life). I found batteries would easily last past 5 years, wouldn't be surprised if they lasted beyond 10 years, and it never was inaccurate for time.The screen is very easy to read in whatever light, direct sunlight through to pitch black (with the backlight). The backlight provides very even lighting. It's also extremely light weight and thin, which is a nice change from a lot of watches with similar feature sets that look like they were carved from a block of rubber.I'm looking to replace it with this one again simply because after that many years the buttons became very hard to press and the glass became so scratched that it is difficult to view the screen. I consider this acceptable though after that many years.The biggest drawback would be the strap, as I'm not a fan of Velcro. This is easily remedied by purchasing a new strap, however (as I have done with my old one).For a basic, everyday watch, I cannot recommend this watch enough.

At one star, it is over-rated.I bought this model as an everyday watch because of its timer and chronometer features and because it was advertised as Water Resistant to 100 meters.  I've use it for about 8 months.  Electronics worked as advertised, though I found that it was not as easy to start, stop, and begin a new timer cycle as Casio watches I've owned.  The ""stop-watch"" feature also was a little cumbersome to use--perhaps because of the splits and other features I don't need.I've never had the chance to use it snorkeling, which is another reason I bought it.  This morning when I put it on, I noticed that some of the letters and numbers on the face were not displaying properly--missing parts of the short segments that darken to form a number/letter.  Later, I noticed the face had moisture condensed on the inside of the crystal.  I have routinely rinsed the watch in running water after coming in from work, dusty or worse.  I rinsed it yesterday.I thought the leak might be due to a loose screw securing the back plate, but that wasn't so--the tiny screws had been torqued so tight that I had to struggle to loosen them.When I got the back off, I noted that the gasket that seals the watch is very thin and does not appear to project above portions of the back upon with the back-plate rests. Either the gasket deteriorated since installation or the design is flawed.I never before bought a watch rated ""water resistent"" to 100 m, and I've never had a problem rinsing or snorkeling with regular water-resistent watches.

The alternate time really came in handy when I wanted to know what time it was back home and I was half way around the world.  Sure, I can just add 10 hours and subtract a day, but when you are at the end of the day and only running on 4 hours sleep it is kind of hard to figure out if now is a good time to call home.  I would also use it as GMT time while I was flying though mutiple time zones.  Very useful if you deal with that.The Indiglo is nice and bright, and the numbers are large and easy to read.  I used the timer many times, and being able to set my alarm to either time-1 or time-2 is quite handy.  The stop watch isn't fancy, but I found it easy to use.  I am also a fan of the cloth wristband.  No cracking rubber, no hair pulling, an exact size, and very comfortable.  You do need to wash it from time to time though.Some of the smaller features are rather handy too.  For instance, when your alram goes off it goes to the alarm display.  You can quickly turn off the alarm and hit the mode button once to get back to the time display.  When the timer goes off, I am brought to the timer display and I can either start again or go back to time.  No need to shuffle though all the displays either way.  Simple but very effective.  They are nice little touches that show that they were thinking when they made this watch.I can't vouch for diving, but I've never had moisture and after several drops and rough handeling, I still see all my display.  I've scratched the display to heck, but I can still read it clearly.The only fault I can think of is the cloth wristband which I mentioned above.

Winnard ""Italian Banjoist""","[0, 0]","Without a doubt, this is the best watch I've ever owned and have been very satisfied with it.  I've had it for 10+ years and it's still going strong, so I've decided to write a review to assure you that this little ticker is well worth the purchase.Let me start with the water resistance.  I actually found this watch in the OCEAN which is how I first acquired it (wild, huh?), and it was fully functional.  I've gone diving with it on, forgotten to take it off during showers, it has truly been weathered, and it holds up wonderfully.  I've never tested if it can actually go 100 meters down in water, but judging that I found it in the ocean I'm certainly inclined to believe it.The watch is very practical for whatever you do, and includes a nice, crisp display and a back light that lets it glow in the dark.  It's vibrant enough so you can see the display very well, and if you hold down the button the back light stays on for a few seconds after you let go of the button which is handy at times.  It also has an alarm to set and you can turn on and off the sound for each hour.  By accessing the Mode button it includes a timer, a stop watch and also what seems to be an alternate time interface for if you want to keep two different times on the same watch.  There is a Set button as well to set the time, and you can have it on army standard time as well.  These buttons are rather tight and a bit hard to push at first, but over time you get used to them and they get more give.The strap is very comfortable, and I like the give that the flexible cloth under the display gives the watch.  The battery performance is excellent, and I've only had to change the battery three times over an eleven-year lifespan.  Very impressive.The only things I can think of that work against this watch, is the Velcro gets worn after about six years or so and I had to apply new Velcro, but for most watches this is to be expected.  Also if you aren't careful the flexible cloth under the watch can get a bit over-flexed and worn if you tug on it a lot for an extended period of time; I've never had this problem, but a work colleague of mine who has the same model had this happen.  Now remember, I'm talking ten years of wear here; me and my colleague have had the same watch for many years, and are very satisfied with how it's held up nonetheless.  (I'm actually the one who referred HIM to buying it in the first place!)In short, this watch simply does what it's supposed to and more.  I wish more watches were made like this, and I've certainly been spoiled by this one.  I would give it a 10 if I could, but Amazon limits me to 5.  This is an incredibly hardy watch, practical and reliable, and it has trustfully served me for over a decade with no problems.  I am very satisfied with every aspect of it and highly, highly recommend you purchase it.

She and I both enjoy these stories, and she always insists on wearing her Gryffindor robe while hearing the stories I tell.Therefore, I think that this product is very educational. Not as much so as the books themselves, all of which she has already memorized.This is one thing that I think the marketers of this product have overlooked. This is a Harry Potter Costume Kit, complete with glasses. It would probably sell a lot better if they were to remove the glasses and the lightning tattoos, and market it as ""Official Hogwart's Robes"". They could even come out with a different design for each house, rather than just selling this item as a Harry Potter Costume Kit, for kids who would like to pretend that they are at a magic school.

Also, the coin purse has a clasp that is difficult for little hands to open, but she figured it out eventually. Apart from those two things, the purse is super cute and seems to be quite durable, as are the accessories that come with it.

She loved the soft purse, and enjoyed the little accoutrements it came with, in particular the mirror, phonre and lipstick. She could of course add whatever else she likes to the small bag. A snack sack? Sunglasses? A small toy? All viable options. It is the perfect size and lightweight soft purse for infants and toddlers. I am pleased she enjoys it. I, personally speaking, wish it had a cuter style or design on the outside as I find the large flower obnoxious but only because I am aesthetically inclined.

I thought this would be a perfect Christmas gift for her, and the price was pretty nice.The purse itself is cute - shiny, soft handles that are easy for little hands to grip, a velcro tab at top to keep the purse closed, but easy to manipulate by a toddler.  However the contents are a bit lame.- The lipstick is the most loved item in the set - my daughter often carries it around and pulls it out of her purse to ""apply"" and tries to put it on me, and even the dog!- The mirror is crap.  It's too small to see a reflection, and is one of those cheapy mirrors that is more like reflective plastic.  A total waste.- The phone is a good size, but it's all molded together - no bells and whistles.  However my daughter doesn't care too much and still plays with it a lot and pretends to make phone calls- The keys are very thin and cheapy, but they still are enjoyed by my daughter and make a jingling sound when she shakes them.  They look enough like keys that she will pretend with them- The debit card is utterly pointless, and I find inappropriate.  At least it's not a credit card, but I don't think any little child should get accustomed to paying for things with plastic.  On top of it, my daughter doesn't ""get"" what it is.  The sticker comes off pretty easily and to her, I think it looks more like toy food than purse contents and it is the ONLY thing in this set she has tried to chew on- The purple clasp container (not sure what it is supposed to be - a compact?) is a hit.  My daughter likes to snap it open and closed.  It's too small however to hold anything other than the stupid debit card.  If it were a bit bigger I could see her enjoying it more and tucking cheerios, a small block etc. into it.  I don't know how long it will last before it snaps in half.So really, the only things we find worthwhile is the purse, the phone, and the lipstick.  Don't really know if it's worth the money, but it does get a lot of play and use from my 24-month old.  She likes to gather her purse and fill it with random toys before we leave the house so she can be ""just like Mommy.""",4.0,"Not the best, but my daughter loves it",1294790400,"01 12, 2011",Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,1.0

On dry pavement (asphalt or concrete), there is a slight feeling similar to having pebbles in the bottom of my shoe, but this does not interfere with running. I recommend these for runners who run in the winter and who may encounter ice.I recommend runners look for models that have a pair of spikes under the heel. The models without heel spikes are for walkers.These have little or no effect in snow; they are for ice. In some cases, there is ice under snow. When this happens, if the snow is thick enough to prevent the studs from penetrating the ice, they will slip. In addition, it is possible for mud to stick to the bottoms, preventing the studs from reaching ice.If you see similar products for much less, be sure to check out the type of studs. Years ago, I saw a similar product for $3 in a home improvement store. Out of curiosity, I tried them. The studs were cheaper, with a malleable alloy. They quickly mashed down, becoming a lot less effective on ice. This product has tungsten carbide spikes, which keep their shape, and last longer.

Not to mention the watch arrived with a broken stem so I can't set the time.  It was a real disappointment, and I intend of course to return it for a FULL REFUND.The reason I wanted to purchase another Skagen watch when my band broke on my other watch, is that I liked the look.  My previous Skagen watch works fine, except for the broken band.  Unfortunately, I was told by several jewelers whom I asked about fixing the watch that it would cost me about the price of a new one to fix the old b/c Skagen sold the company and the new owners have TERRIBLE customer service.In short, this watch is not what I had hoped for.  There is nothing unique or interesting about it.  The key feature, for me, that commends the Skagen brand is its thin, sleek casing.  Clearly that is no longer the case, at least not with this particular model.  Not sure if they no longer manufacture that line anymore.  But absent the sleek look, I will select another brand and one that I know I can service without hassle.

I was able to ascertain through just a couple of search suggestions the brand of watch that would give me those criteria.  I have always been a Seiko fan, but was not able to find a Seiko that would be large enough for me to see the dial hands.  After a search for a couple minutes, I came upon this Skagen Titanium watch.  This dials were large enough and the face was wide enough so that I had no difficulty in reading the time.

It is so light you don't feel it on.  It's great if you are a cyclist and want to reduce every once of weight on your bike. Quite literally, it is about 1/3 the weight of an average steel band watch. It has a sleek profile compared to most steel band watches so rarely gets snagged on things while doing work.  The face is also smaller than most  comparable watches.  About 1/2 way between a normal man's size watch and a womans watch.  I personally like the color of titanium over stainless steel and have received compliments on this watch for that reason.  It is fairly scratch resistant.  I am very abusive with my watches.  I wear them 24 hours a day even while working or in water.  I do a lot of hands on woodwork etc.  I've drug the face across some sharp metal stuff and this has put some light scratches on the face.  Under normal use I suspect it would not get too scratched up.  The band rarely comes unlatched even if you do happen to snag it on something.  The pins have never bent or come out, ever!  I think the titanium latch has better wear over stainless steel watch bands. The pins are probably also made of titanium.  It don't know for certain but given the fact they've never come out I assume so.  Titanium is much stronger than steel.  The band itself is very smooth and comfortable.  It never pinches the skin or feels irritating.  The reason why I have had 2 now instead of one is that I crashed on my road bike during a 30+ mph sprint and it was drug across 10 feet or more of pavement after an initial hard impact.  That broke the face of the watch and put some deep scratches into the titanium but the band never broke or came off.  The hands were still good.  If I remember correctly I think the watch was still working after all that until I started messing with the hands on it.  I paid $100 for it both times.  Now that I see they are a lot less on Amazon I think I'll buy another so if I eventually lose or break this one in maybe 10 years from now I'll have another to replace it.  You will not be disappointed if you buy this watch. You will seriously be saving money because it is nearly indestructible and you won't lose it if you never take it off because the band doesn't ever break or come off the watch.",5.0,Best watch I've ever owned,1196985600,"12 7, 2007",Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,1.0

I got it for $100 at a Sunglasses Hut.Ticking: The watch ticks louder at the 9-2 position, inaudible otherwise.  Since I sleep in absolute quiet, I can hear it by my bedside.  I often pick it up off the nightstand and toss it across the room.  Can't hear it unless it is dead quiet and within a few feet.Clasp: After a few years, I had to adjust the catch on the clasp, since it started coming loose (I wear it pretty tight).  I was worried about breaking it off, but I was careful and it worked out fine.Links: When I took the links out initially, I used a safety pin. No biggie.  I've adjusted it easily a few times since using the holes for quick adjustment on the clasp.Activities: I've worn this watch almost every day doing almost anything from working outside to swimming.  I replaced the battery twice, I figure I'm due for another battery change soon. Last time, I did the change myself at Wal-Mart using their tools.Accuracy: I set the watch EXACTLY to my phone every stupid time change.

After about 1 year, which incidentally is the Warranty Period, the watch started falling apart.  First, the little tab on the clasp broke off.  Then, one of the dial markers (the 7-o'clock marker) popped out and was floating around banging around inside the watch face.  Then lastly, the watch keeps dying on me.  I changed the battery with new fresh batteries 3 times already, and it dies on me all the time.

You'll see some of the bands have little arrows on them.  These are the ones you can remove.  Do NOT pull on the outside portion of the link - it does not slide out.  You need to place a small pointed object (like an awl) into the hole next to the arrow and use it to push out on the inside piece.  This is a U-shaped piece.  You can slide it out a few millimeters, then carefully grab it with a small pair of pliers and pull it out the rest of the way.  (once its out a little ways, you can slip the awl back into the slot and use that to pull it out the rest of the way... I found that easier)Once you get two (or more) of them apart, you can remove the other link parts and put it back together.NOTE:  This is a bit tricky and you have to be careful not to scratch anything.  If you aren't comfortable with it, I'd take it to a jeweler.  On the up side - if you need to remove a link, just try it on that one link.

I liked the understated design, and had been looking for a smaller, simple, titanium watch for some time.This watch is very good looking, very light, and very comfortable.  The fit and finish is very good for a watch in this price range.  I've read reviews that complain of loud ticking, but mine is essentially silent and has a quartz movement.  The crystal is also flat against the top of the case.  Some reviews mention a raised crystal that was easily shattered.  There may have been a redesign of both the movement and crystal, I don't know.I had a jeweler resize the band.  The process is simple, but I did not have a punch thin enough to remove the odd U-shaped pins (various tools proved ineffective), and I was concerned about damaging the band.  The jeweler had a pair of pliers apparently designed for these types of pins, and he was able to press the pins out.The two negatives I have found so far are very dim luminescent markings, and a relatively low water-proof rating (I would have preferred 5 or 10 ATM).  I have not owned the watch long enough to comment on its reliability, but with the warranty covering movement for life, I consider this a good value.  Even if I need to replace the band or crystal ($35 and $25 from Skagen, respectively), this watch will still be less expensive than the alternatives I've looked at.",4.0,Great value,1196380800,"11 30, 2007",Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,1.0

It's very easy to catch it on things and have it pop open. I ended up bending it a tiny bit so it didn't open so easily. The directions that came with with the watch to adjust the band were printed so small, I actually needed a magnifier to read. When I did, I found the band this watch comes with, was not the same type in the directions to re-size it.

Ten years I have worn this watch, and it has held up better than I could have ever hoped. It has seen ocean water, chlorinated swimming pools, motor oil, gasoline, solvent, sweat, and extreme cold. It has only ever needed two batteries, a new crystal, and a new clasp.The scratch I got on the crystal was from a bolt on the bottom of an engine block, and without the watch I would've needed stitches on my wrist, without a doubt. The clasp wore out after eight years from having taking the watch on and off several thousand times, and was easily replaceable with a nearly identical Seiko clasp. Everything else is still in exactly the shape it was when I got it. This watch does not 'wear out'.If this ever comes back to the Amazon store, or if you're interested enough to shop around for it, Skagen 105LTX definitely won't disappoint. It's a great timepiece for those who value simplicity, class, and functionality over 'bling' factor.My only qualm with the watch is that it has a second hand. It's nearly silent, but I sleep with my arm over my face and the subtle ticking of the watch wakes me up if I fall asleep with it on. Obviously that won't apply to/bother normal people.One thing to note though - the face on mine is the same titanium gray as the body... Not black like in the image.

However here are the issues I have with them:Most importantly, everything about this watch is propriatery. Changing batteries is a pain as you can't find them locally and it costs $14.95. Bands are $34.95. Also you better keep your sales receipt even though they have lifetime warranty.I sent in my replacement band and battery with payment for two watches in July and they cashed the check and didn't receive anything until January.  I called them and they promised to send a free battery, but when I received the items finally in March, no battery was included (let alone a free one).Other issues:a) Wire mesh bands: The clasp is not always tight and over time will slide and get a little loose. Also the titanium mesh is made of tiny small circles of metal interlocked and if one of them gets open (say you hit something), it starts unraveling slowly but surely.b) Leather band: The one I have fell apart so quickly it is surprising. It also started smelling bad due to sweat (I do not sweat that much and I owned other watches with leather bands). This seems to be a very bad quality.c) Water - my watch started fogging after 2 years of light usage.I will NOT buy another Skagen watch. Their customer service and business practices are shady.

Other metal bands pinched and pulled, this one has remained smooth, cool and comfortable.The clasp is very secure, and thousands of uses later still clicks tightly onto the latch.

So, because the second hand doesn't move continuously, but instead jumps in one-second increments, it's difficult if not impossible to glance at the watch while driving down the road and be able to discern the correct time. You have to stare at the watch face until you see one of the hands jump, then you have to look for the hand that didn't jump to find the minute hand, then you should be able to tell what time it is. However, by that time you may be on the verge of an auto accident because you had to stare at your watch too long! For this flaw alone I would not recommend anyone buy this watch, unless this flaw is fixed.The other problems I had with this watch is the lack of durability of the band and clasp. At about the three-year mark, the clasp cover would no longer stay closed over the clasp, and would instead swing freely back and forth as my wrist moved. This elicited many comments from people pointing out to me that my watch clasp was loose. That necessitated my explanation that it was in fact not the clasp but the clasp cover that was not latched, but that it was broken and could not be latched. About a year and a half after that (the 4-1/2 year mark), the edge of mesh band began to disintegrate at one particular spot, causing sharp points of wire ends to snag and tear at my clothing. For this reason I was forced to stop wearing this watch, as it was destroying my clothing. For six more months I kept the watch in my car console, but finally the battery (which was not the factory one but a replacement) got too weak, which caused it to lose quite a bit of time and so it became completely useless.One note about the reviewers who wrote that they hear an audible ticking sound from the watch: They must have a watch with a manufacturing anomaly, because the only way I can hear my watch ticking is to put it right up against my ear, and even then it is faintly heard.My ending feeling on this watch is that I got a few good years out of it, which I enjoyed other than the difficulty of locating the minute hand at a glance. But the final couple of years were more annoyance than pleasure, and so I would not recommend this watch to anyone.My new watch will be a Citizen Eco-Drive (solar powered) with a leather band.",3.0,Nice but not as durable as it looks,1250899200,"08 22, 2009",Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,0.0

I use them to tell time and usually don't give it a lot of thought otherwise. My previous favorite was a simple wind up that I bought years ago for $20. That changed when my wife bought me this last year.To start, it has some flaws. There's no light of any type, so if it's dark - you'd better have a light source or a different way of telling time. The catch can be finicky at times and your fingertip might smart for a while after popping it loose. The crystal face is convex ... so I've scratched it up a bit. There also seem to be concentric rings on the face of the watch that I only notice under certain light conditions.Now the good. It's extremely simple. There's one knob, 3 hands, and a date. It's extremely light and handsome. The band is absolutely excellent. I love it. My wife paid full price for it last year and I think it was worth it. Seeing it at half price now makes me want to buy another.I've had it for 11 months now and it's been through combat skills training, helicopter flights, convoys, and the daily grind of deployment in a desert environment. It's definitely banged up and worn. It's been treated very harshly, but I've only managed to damage the face and mesh band slightly.

Crystal:  The crystal is the same mineralized material used in most fashion watches and sport watches like Timex.  You'd think that would make it a little tougher but not really.

He really liked the show when we got him Jay Jay and Tracy. Playing with the toys has enhanced his enjoyment of the show. He actually likes the show better now.A responsible child development professional who hadn't seen the show didn't get it. After we convinced her that its not a Thomas thing, she asked, ""What does it do?"" That's just the point! IT does practically nothing; the kid does it all!The size is absolutely perfect for a child's hand. You really need to get two of the characters, though, because it becomes a thrilling two-hand experience.I think that part of the reason that these toys are so great is that they really look so much like the characters on TV. When my son watches the show, his Herky flies right along with the one on screen. I believe these toys actually promote active television watching.OK, now the down-side. The planes are guaranteed for 100 years, but every single plane has broken in at least some small way. They are very well made and durable, but my 2 1/2 year old is a formidable foe. I know these are not rated for kids under 3, and if you are not going to supervise your 2 year old's play, do not get these until she or he is a little older. I would say that the safe time is when your child stops putting just about everything in her or is mouth.An interesting issue with the warrantee: after I sent the double-broken Snuffy back for repair or replacement, I read the fine print. It said that plastic parts are not covered. Almost half of some of these toys is plastic, so I said Aha, there's the catch. Most of the breakages have been plastic. However, Action Products promtly sent a replacement Snuffy, even though both breaks were plastic.So, what does this all mean? I say, definitely buy it.
