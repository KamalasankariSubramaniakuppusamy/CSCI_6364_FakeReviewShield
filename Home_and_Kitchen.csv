Sure it holds color better and makes a great presentation, it just isn't a pleaseing thing to eat.We did take away some ideas, we did use some fondant flowers on the lower layers (least likely to be eaten), and used butterccream for the really good and most enjoyed layers.Good Job Martha, maybe next time you could show how to make butter cream just as attractive as fondant.MOTB",2.0,Mother of the Bride,1214784000,"06 30, 2008",Home_and_Kitchen,0.0

The decorating style is very Martha Stewart:  classically elegant.  The book does not provide pictures of whimsical cakes - there are other books on the market for that.While I did not buy the book for cake recipes (so I can't judge the quality and flavor of the ones provided), I did buy the book to complement a wedding cake decorating class that I am taking.  If you are a baker who is very interested in cake decorating, or need instruction on how to prepare large, multi-layered cakes, ""Wedding Cakes"" is very helpful.  If you are willing to put the considerable amount of time needed to perfect these techniques, (and believe me, it takes a lot of practice), this book is a wonderful resource.

Pulling a boa constrictor snake named Mathilda out of your backpack can make a remarkable first impression! This book is about three best friends Elias, Honoria, and Shohei, who are united against ""That Which Is The Peshtigo School"". Their goal is to make it through the annual school science fair, but things don't always go as planned.Elias is part of a family made up of science fanatics who would do anything to win a science fair. Elias isn't exactly what you'd call the ambitious type, especially when it comes to science fairs. So he becomes like Galileo and ""retests"" one of his sibling's past projects. Honoria loves to be ambitious, especially when it comes to being a legal counsel extraordinaire. But when she faces a bigger challenge than beating Goliath Reed or getting a piranha to become vegetarian, she doesn't know if she can make it. Shohei is an all around slacker who tries to mooch off Elias instead of creating something on his own. His adoptive parents are constantly encouraging him to start ""hearing"" his ancestors. His mom has even turned Shohei's room into what looks like a walk-in Japanese museum exhibit!This book is laugh out loud hilarious and the more you read, the more exciting and unexpected it gets. I love the title on this book because it really made me laugh and want to read the book. I also like how people so different from one another can be such close friends. There is not much excitement in the beginning, but it builds up very quickly.

If you love to create cakes, and not just bake them, this will feed your appetite for cake baking and decorating, and you will place this alongside your other prized tomes of cake education. It's a wonderful journey of the wedding cake, aka ""a good thing"". If you purchased Martha's ""WEDDINGS"" book, this is the expanded and transformed chapter on cakes into this book.Martha has outdone herself once more in her passion to give us every possible idea, and instruction, to create the wedding cake of our dreams for the day of our dreams. And to join her in this quest is Wendy Kromer, master baker, who worked for Martha for many years, on both Martha's former TV show and for Martha Stewarts ""Weddings"" magazine; she now owns and operates her own bakery.While this book was made to help engaged couples decide on what type of cake they would like for their wedding, it also gives instructions should you wish to bake your own wedding cake. For those established bakers and caterers that are looking for ideas and concepts, this will be certainly be a well-referenced tool. The ""Album of Cakes"" section offers 111 official photographs of cakes, but if you add all photo's of cakes from other parts of this book, you will have well over 135 delectable wedding delights in which to choose.Martha and Wendy do not hold back on any instruction and it begins with the incredible photography of each cake, frosting, filling, and detail of these stunning cakes. These cakes come from both Martha's former TV show, Martha's ""Weddings"" magazines, as well as some new ones from collaboration with other cake artists.A hallmark of the Martha brand is that she is quite detailed in everything that she wishes to teach, and that is never more seen than here. There are some techniques that will require a professional to do such as the ""bubbles"" or ""pulled sugar ribbon"" for some of these cakes, and rightfully, she has not included those instructions in this book because they are labor and equipment intensive, as well as for safety reasons (you are working with intense heat with one, and need specific equipment for the other, let alone the need for specific training).If at all possible, try to obtain of copy of Martha's VHS tape called ""Cake Decorating"". It is the visual form of instruction on making some fabulous cakes, from simple 2-layer party cakes to actually assembling a 4-tier wedding cake. They were segments taken from her former TV show in which she, and guests, demonstrated this art of cake decorating. I am hoping that she will consider bringing that out again in DVD form. It is an excellent teaching tool and my copy has been well-worn out!This is a very big book, coffee table size, so along with excellent photography, the photos are large and show detail such as brush strokes of hand-painted fondant or delicate designs of rubber stamps used to imprint fondant. The use of gumpaste flowers and marzipan helps to complete certain dimensional and visual appearances desired.The journey begins:MARTHA AND WENDY'S INTRODUCTIONCHOOSING YOUR CAKE:Finding Inspiration: What style are you looking for? (modern, rustic, etc). What season? Location? Motif?

I was hoping there were more where those came from. This book emphasizes very sweet dessert pops, however. There are 41 recipes in total, only 13 of which are fruit pops. There is a ""Fresh and Fruity"" chapter, followed by three chapters of dessert pops entitled ""I Scream for Quick Pops!"", ""Bake Shop"", and  ""Coco Loco"". As you might guess from the last one, there are 15 pop recipes that contain chocolate.Chapters on ""Tips"" and ""Techniques"" are useful. There is more detailed information about ingredients that don't freeze well in the Zoku than is found in the instruction manual. The book lists options for dairy products and sweeteners, tells you how to do different types of layers, how to add decorative fruit slices, how to do a quick shell, and how to make core pops. The pages about core pops are especially helpful, as they include recipes for pink, purple, and orange outer layers for brightly-colored core pops. The book recommends using Zoku accessory kits, but you can do without.The pop recipes tend to go out of their way to be as sweet as possible. Many, including the recipe for a vanilla base, call for vanilla pudding, where vanilla Greek yogurt would do just as well. I've substituted it with no ill effect. On the bright side, many of these recipes may appeal to children, whereas most pop books that I have seen are geared more to adults. There are flavors like ""Cookie Dough"", ""That's a S'more"", chocolate peanut butter, and peanut butter and jelly. All 9 recipes in ""Bake Shop"" are inspired by cake and cookie recipes.As a resource for light, fresh-tasting fruit pop recipes, ""Zoku Quick Pops"" is very limited. Most of the fruit recipes are gimmicky and contain too many ingredients. The recipe for Lemonade pops contains orange juice, which is fine, but the addition of vanilla extract kills the fresh fruit flavor. The recipe for mango pops includes orange, apple, banana and lemon, which are too many competing flavors. Mango and orange together make a terrific pop. The book is great for chocolate lovers and those looking for dessert pop recipes. Tips and techniques are also useful. For fruit pop recipes, ""Top Pops"" by Emily Zaiden is far better.",4.0,"Excels at Sweet Dessert Pops, but Falls Short on the Fruit Pops.",1367712000,"05 5, 2013",Home_and_Kitchen,1.0

They are a great way to learn field marks and identification in a way that you will remember them when out in the field. The Peterson Field Color-In Guides are not meant as a replacement for a regular field guide, but they are an excellent supplement for them. With the winter months coming on, you will really enjoy having these Peterson Field Color-In Guides at home to color and learn when the weather will not allow you to get outside and hike, kayak, or explore nature.I purchased the Peterson Color In Book Wildflowers during a visit to the Bosque del Apache Wildlife Refuge Gift Shop last week. (Actually I had quite a little coloring book shopping spree, so I will be reviewing more of them later this week!) I have been wanting a copy of one of the The Peterson Field Guide Color-In Books for a while, and this gave me a chance to make the purchase in a way that benefits a wildlife refuge that I use and enjoy. (I will be writing a blog entry for my main blog about our visit to the refuge later, and will be sure and link to it here in case you are interested)What I like about this coloring book for adults is that it has detailed drawings to color of the wildflowers, along with a few facts about each of them. There are four pages of colored stickers at the front of the color-in book for reference. You can place the stickers next to the line drawing for reference, as they suggest, or leave them where they are and peek back and forth (that would be me) or even use them to decorate something completely different.The book overall is divided into four sections by environment. Three related wildflowers are featured on a page, with some facts about each of them, for several pages.  There are followed by a two page spread to color showing the flowers in their natural environment. The pages are good quality, but printed front and back. Like many of my coloring books, I will probably scan all of the pages and print out and color the ones I want to work on at any given time. I can't wait until the people who print coloring books figure this out and start giving us a CD-ROM of the pages along with a printed version of the book. The fine line, detailed and intricate drawings beg for colored pencil to work them, although the introduction suggests you might also want to use watercolors. Crayons can be used, but are probably much too blunt for many of the smaller details.In conclusion, I am really happy with this coloring book for adults. It is an excellent way to learn to identify the wildflowers, shells, or animal species, while also being fun. I think it would be a great addition to a home schooling program, or for any older child or adult who is very interested in nature.",5.0,An excellent way to learn to identify wildflowers,1352678400,"11 12, 2012",Home_and_Kitchen,1.0

Unlike other thermos-type cups, this one actually keeps the beverage hot for quite some time, especially if you place the cap on it. The cap itself is really unique in the way it works. After filling with a hot liquid the cap fits rather loosely in place. But, after a few seconds heat expands it and it wedges itself in place very securely. You can still pry it off but not easily when it's hot which is just what you'd want. Also, that cap has a neat little sliding anti-splash tab on the top that actually works.The cup is wide enough to be stable sitting on a flat surface - with or without liquid in it - yet fits easily into a car tray cup holder for travel.After using the cup for a few days I decided that I didn't want the nylon handle. I simply used a heat gun (on low) to gently heat it up and just pulled it down and off of the cup.That handle is secured to the cup with some glue and a slight ridge running around its inner circumference. It was easy to clean off the remaining glue from the stainless steel and I could - if I wanted to - re-glue and reattach the handle.This is a great insulated stainless steel cup with or without a handle and well worth the price.",5.0,Insulated stainless steel cup that actually works,1321747200,"11 20, 2011",Home_and_Kitchen,1.0

Scales ""tea drinker""","[8, 10]","This mug comes in a variety of colors most of which are hard to find on Amazon, easy to find on the seller's website but not easy to order. It's worth the effort of figuring out how to place the order though, as this mug keeps tea hot for a good couple of hours, and even longer if left in a sunny car. I have tried a variety of different travel mugs of similar size and this one is by far the best for not retaining the flavor of the previous cup of tea thanks to its metal instead of plastic interior. Additionally it is better designed, fitting nicely in the car cup-holder and having a flat lid that doesn't poke your nose every time you take a sip, and allows you to close the hole in the lid by sliding the cover with your teeth so you don't have to take both hands off the wheel while driving. The only minor quibble is that the sliding cover is a little hard to clean underneath - this is not a problem for black or fruit teas, but if you take milk, a gunge can build up once in a while. Timolino addressed this problem in their version 2.0 mug by making the cover un-clippable for easier washing, but unfortunately also modified the rest of the lid so that now it has a big lip like other mugs, making it hard to sip, and also added more weight to the top of the mug with unnecessary extra plastic and a thicker handle. The best would be to revert to this version 1.0 mug and just make the sliding cover un-clippable.",5.0,Best travel mug ever,1264204800,"01 23, 2010",Home_and_Kitchen,1.0

Ligtenberg ""AnnaLovesBooks""","[3, 3]","ISBN 0689856849 - Whether or not you enjoy this book will probably depend on what it is you expect from it.  It is easy to become confused by the cover statement ""From the creator ofTen Little Ladybugs"".  The creator/author of that book is Melanie Gerth, and she is also the creator of Good Night, Sweet Butterflies - but she is not the author here.  The text in this case is by Dawn Bentley, illustrations by Heather Cahoon.  That information, intentionally or not, is hidden away on the back cover in small letters.  Ladybugs fans might find themselves disappointed.Nine glittery plastic butterflies head off to find a place to sleep.  One by one, they choose a place, until there are none left.  It is time to sleep until another day arrives.While technically a Board Book, the pages here are much thinner than the usual board book binding.  That and the small, not too hard to remove butterflies (a potential choking hazard) make the book unsuitable for children under 3.  There are cut-outs on the cover for all nine butterflies and each succeeding page has one less cut-out, which is a nice way to learn to count down from 9.  The places the butterflies choose to sleep are color-based (the blue butterfly chooses a blue stream, the red on red roses, etc), so colors are introduced as well.  The negative comes in two parts, both in the writing.  The text is in rhyme, but the rhyming pattern is clunky, with long lines and no evident cadence to it.  In addition, some lines are tongue twisters (""with a pink piglet and three playful pink possums""), which only makes reading the rhyme more difficult.  If your child is likely to spend a lot of time on the counting, you'll take so long between pages that the rhyme issues won't matter anyway, but it's an annoyance that what is essentially a poem doesn't flow the way you expect it to.  Really a nice book and a super cute idea, Butterflies is just missing something in the text.- AnnaLovesBooks",4.0,"Good Night, Sweet Butterflies",1220486400,"09 4, 2008",Home_and_Kitchen,1.0

It gives you instructions on how to assemble cakes on stands, pillars or stacked construction.  It also contains recipes for basic scratch cakes in white, yellow, chocolate, strawberry, and banana.  It also has the recipes for standard Wilton Icings, fillings, glazes, fondant (not the tasty marshmallow kind), color flow, gum paste, and candy clay.  There are tips for baking, leveling, torting, filling and icing the cakes.  It also gives some instruction on how to cover a cake with fondant.  There are suggestions for transporting tiered cakes, calculating servings per cake and cutting guides.  The book also includes patterns and instructions for various decorations.  As with all Wilton books, the last few pages detail products you can buy from them to duplicate all the designs in the book.  The problem is that some of these items don't seem to be available on their web site any more.  The book was first published in 2005.  Still, it's a great idea book and I'm sure you can find acceptable substitutes for a lot of the items.  The book contains ideas for cakes that could be served at weddings, anniversaries, and showers.Also, I'm not sure if it's offered everywhere, but I'm currently enrolled in a class taught by a Wilton Instructor called ""Tall Cakes"".  It is taught in two sessions.  The first class is a demonstration by the instructor on how to put together a tiered cake.  The second class is where we bring in our own cakes and learn how to stack or pillar them.  It's less expensive than the other classes, no kit is required and the items needed are this book, one six-inch and one ten-inch layer cake, the plate/pillars, and our decorations.

I still found it very visually appealing though, and will try to create a similar effect in a tastier way.

It's good for starting out, and getting a feel for cake decorating before trying more advanced cakes such as tiered or completely fondant cakes.Note: You'll need THICK frosting for the flowers in this book. Follow the Wilton recipe, and you should be fine.There are also some very good ideas for cakes in this book. Not only the cake on the front cover, I showed an idea to a woman getting married from inside the book and she wanted it for her wedding (yes, that good.)I would highly recommend getting this book if you want a good overall idea of how to start decorating cakes.

There is a helpful section called ""The Perfect Cupcakes; How to bake, ice and decorate"", and there are about six pages of recipes. Most cupcake instructions are from 1/8 to 1/2 page long, right next to a big, clear picture.After getting over the ""it wasn't what I expected"" part of receiving this book, and seeing that my boyfriend seems rather enthusiastic about making really whimsical cupcakes and loves the silly-feet, I like this book more and more. Just don't expect anything sophisticated looking in it OR that many silly-feet ideas. If you are familiar with the typical adverbook that Wilton puts out, you shouldn't find any surprises here, and some of the recipes, which are a blend of from-a-mix and from-scratch, for the most part look very tempting.There are six pages of really cute Halloween cupcakes, including a vampire in a coffin, and some skeletons/ghosts/tombstones.",4.0,Typical Wilton adverbook,1192924800,"10 21, 2007",Home_and_Kitchen,1.0

I expected some more fancy things ... but I got it half price so i'm not complaining , just a warrning that if you know how to put shapes on your fondant covered cake , then you might want to serch for a more complex book ...

The recipes for muffins and cakes are great. Every year wilton updates the creative aspects of a cake form and this one is just spectacular. The designs are doable by those with almost no coordination or cake decorating experience. The key is always to make your own frosting so it is thick enought to hold shapes, or add a LOT of powdered sugar to commercial frostings to thicken them. Anyway, there are literally 150 full color cupcakes. There are your hilarious farm animals, awesome swimmers for whom the cupcakes are inflatable innertubes, wedding cupcakes, floral, clowns, fruits, bunnies, seasonal and more. You will need to get some tips you may not normally have, but the ones you need are in the directions. I highly recommend the 24 cupcake stand Wilton makes for displaying your cupcakes. I use a 3 tiered dessert rack that is also a carousel that spins because I already have it for cakes. But there are some beautiful cupcakes that look awesome displayed on the top of any stemed goblet that has been turned upside down so the base become a litte table for the cupcake. The angel, penguin, and Christmas themes are just adorable, but there are sophisticate cupcakes too. If you buy the silicon cupcake holders you will be thrilled.

I have to say, however, that some of the instructions in it were contradicted by our instructor and she said she was instructed by Wilton to do so. I certainly felt that her way was better and, since it involves such basic instructions, I wanted to share it with you.For all the projects in this book other than covering the cake base and the cake itself--that is to say all the flowers, the bow, the leaves, and the borders along the bottom--wherever it says to use just gum paste, you should use a 1/2 gum paste and 1/2 fondant mix. Sure enough, it made it easier to do everything, there was less hardening and bumps, and everything looked prettier. (I had previously worked with gum paste on my own and wish I'd known this).Another thing that I noticed is that, in some cases, (especially the bow) the final product would have looked MUCH nicer if we'd made them thinner rather than as instructed in the booklet. It may be that, since this is an introductory course to forming decorations by sculpting rather than by piping, maybe they thought that thinner would have been harder to work with.But, all in all, it's a very nice reference (as well as an effective advertisement for countless Wilton products!)",4.0,Companion booklet for Level 3 Fondant & Gum Paste,1331596800,"03 13, 2012",Home_and_Kitchen,1.0

I purchased threeWilton Round Brownie Pop Molds, and a bag ofWilton Dark Candy Cocoa Meltsin order to make the ""Fun-filled Pops.""

Fantastic kitchen item! Makes making gourmet style baked apples a breeze! The only caveat that I have is...if you're cooking for just 2...make one baked apple. I used a good sized John-o-gold, wonderful flavor and texture, but one apple would definitely fill 2 for dessert.A little bit of spillage in the oven, but that was caught by the pan I had them in, so simple clean up.

As an instructor of Humanities (college level), I am always looking for unusual products that stimulate students' thinking and inspire interest in course topics. Art appreciation sometimes isn't the most exciting topic because it is often presented in dry, stilted manners--or in endless powerpoint presentations, which signal naptime for some students. So to avoid this academic quagmire, I've searched for engaging, fun products that would capture and hold student interests. The ""Go Fish for Art"" series proves to be the perfect solution for me and for my students! These clever card games are non-threatening, exciting ways to bring today's young people to art studies. The games promote critical thinking, questioning, and observation, helping students to develop their own personal connections with visual art.The description on the box states its goals (quoted below):Play two classic card games of memory, strategy, and art appreciation. / Play ""Go fish"" and ""Memory"" and collect amazing art by Calder, Chagall, Hopper, Klee, Lichtenstein, Marc, Thiebaud, and Warhol.So, here are two ways to play--two ways to infuse art learning painlessly, even with the most reluctant students! LOL [The games are designed for 2 to 3 players. With creativity, these games can be adapted by the instructor to different sized classes. However, for large classes and for more direct student participation / fun, I recommend having several packs of these cards and dividing the big class into smaller learning groups.]About the game: These are quality, well-made cards that illustrate the major portions of great works as part of the game (see my note below about partial views). The numbered cards make it easy for students to compare / contrast the great works of the artists and indeed of the artists' individual styles themselves. This card game pack includes a fact booklet about the artists and play directions for both learning games. ""Masterpiece Memory / Concentration"" includes a small set of directions for adapting the game to even younger players.To give one an idea of the scope of this product, here are just some of the amazing featured works (partial views) in this product:Warhol: ""Jackie"" and ""Campbell's Soup Can""Thiebaud: ""Three Machines"" and ""Cakes""Marc: ""Blue Fillies"" and ""The Little Mountain Goats""Lichtenstein: ""In the Car"" and ""Live Ammo (Blang)""Klee: ""Castle in the Sun"" and ""Glance out of Red""Hopper: ""Cape Cod Evening"" and ""Gas""Chagall: ""The Rooster"" and ""The Juggler""Calder: Untitled Mobile and ""Bird""Explanation of partial views: some works are so detailed it would be difficult to illustrate them meaningfully on small ""playing"" cards. The producers of these cards seem to have chosen the works' major ""focal points"" to depict on the little cards--leaving the full illustrations for the player's own investigations / research. I am satisfied with this choice because it can be a useful enrichment aspect to playing the games; students can be assigned homework related to discovering the full works and / or one work in particular. :)  At any rate, for the purposes of the game, I believe that it's better to get a good look at part of a work than a postage-stamp sized view of the whole thing, where detail is too tiny to even discern or appreciate.This product is appropriate for humanities classes, art classes, and homeschooling. It might also make a great rainy day pass-time or a product for a classroom's ""game"" corner. There are other ""Go Fish for Art"" products--some versions also include a companion book for more in-depth experiences, including Renaissance and Modern Artists.",5.0,Explore Modern Art...,1230336000,"12 27, 2008",Home_and_Kitchen,1.0

I'm more visual and the software has been easier way for me to learn ""hands-on"" with a Hint button.

I play with my 23 yo son who understands the strategy better than I do - so, between games, I am learning with this software which is very user friendly. Since this is a game that will take a life-time to learn, I find that the software gives me patient learning that the even the lowest ranked on-line players can't give me - including the time to think things over and take back dumb moves.If you want to learn the game of GO - BEWARE, it is VERY adicting.

The Mighty Bright hits all those points with excellence.  If you want something to hold up a book you don't need some high tech foldable stand or some fancy wooden slab as big as a chopping board.  What you need to hold up ANY book is a sturdy piece of wire which can be folded up.  In short what you need is the Mighty Bright Book Holder.This 11 dollar product has seriously made law school considerably less painful.  I read big massive casebooks for many hours each day in the school library.  The law school was considerate enough to make every single table and desk short enough that a 5 year could study on the tables.  What that means for adult sized people like me is that neck strain is virtually unavoidable.  However, since I got my little book stand law studying for law school has literally become less painful!  I can now concentrate on legal nonsense and not worry about neck pain.  I SERIOUSLY recommend this book holder for any student who is spending lots of time reading out of large books.  The Mighty Bright can accommodate even my 1200 page Constitutional Law Book.  If you have a textbook of any size, the Mighty Bright Holder will simply make studying less onerous.  Additionally, the book holder is so small and light you can slip it in your backpack and not even notice its there.  Finally, for such an inexpensive product it seems very durable.  I've only had it for a semester but I've abused it pretty badly and its holding up fine.  Honestly, even if it were to break after a year at this price its worth buying another.  But i doubt it will break anytime soon because its essentially a wire.  Almost nothing to break.ConsWont work well with tiny books.  Anything as big a a standard bible will be fine though.It also has some trouble accommodating MASSIVE books.  I have trouble turning the pages of my 1000+ page books.  So if you are using textbooks thinker than dictionaries, your results may vary.  Anything &#60;1000 pages should be okay though.Other thoughtsI lack common sense (law student) so it took me forever to find an efficient way to turn pages of books while on the stand.  The best method I've found so far is to use one hand to push the book so it is flush against the back wire, then turn the page with your other hand, then releasing allowing the book to slide back into position.

In fact, I am writing this review on iPad that is propped up with it.The only problem that I have with it is the manufacturing quality. The first holder that I bought broke after a few months of use. I still went ahead and bought a new one because I feel that its many advantages far outweigh this shortcoming, and hopefully if I am a bit more careful with how I store it and handle it it may last longer this time around.",4.0,The no-frills book stand,1275177600,"05 30, 2010",Home_and_Kitchen,1.0

All of these features are from personal experience with the product over three years of use:- It can easily fit into a backpack and will not damage the stuff you put it in with (no major pinch points)- It accommodates a broad variety of medium to large textbooks (it handled my 900 page electronics text beautifully)- It has a very nice viewing angle for desk work (minimal head craning to move from notes to book)- It saves space on your desk from traditional use (dorm room desks are horribly small)- It is pretty sturdy and can be dropped repeatedly (unlike many other book stands/holders)- It is easy to slide around on a desk (this could be good or bad, good if your workspace changes a lot)- If you put a mass market paperback into it, it will slide around and pages are hard to turn.- The folding mechanism is sturdy and the product can stand up to all kinds of bending (friends jokingly tried to break it all the time)- It doesn't look flashy, but people comment all the time on how nice a stand it is (especially other students; I bought one as a well-received gift for a roommate)- You can highlight books in the stand, but you can't easily write on them (it will slide)I'd recommend this product for the hardworking note-takers. It's a robust product that can be thrown into a bag, slid around on a desk, and subjected to all kinds of tomes. It'd even make a nice gift for a new college student, who might not appreciate it at first, but will grow to love it like I have.If you're buying this for mass market paperbacks, it's a 3-star product.

The design itself with it's ""hooked"" arms keeps the pages open. In fact not having the ""flipper"" arms is better. I set my book open in class and hold the pages back on each side of a section of material that the professor is discussing. That way I am able to quickly flip between pages during the lecture as the professor discusses specific text.

I purchased three of these books, ranked A,B,CMindWare Perplexors: Level A(A is the easiest, and C the most demanding).  To promote the idea of having fun with them, I give incentives for thinking them through and finding the correct answers.  There is no penalty for failure, but the incentives increase in value according to how well they actually do. Because the students I work with are at different levels and there is constant turnover, I use photocopies of the pages. Sometimes, two or more will be working on the same puzzle, and often, once a child gets the hang of it, he/she moves rapidly through the levels.  I have no statistical proof of improvement, but I believe they have not only improved in focus, but they're also reading with better comprehension.I haven't bought the D book yet, but at this rate, I may be getting it soon!  I recommend the books, especially for parent-involved home use.  This method seems to work best in one-on-one situations.

One in each color to correspond to the standard Tree House set of stacking plastic pyramids (these are not included but are required).  Each board has nine spaces in a 3X3 grid.  Each space has on and off arrows to show possible directions of movement.  At the start of the game, pieces are stacked so that there three different colors and none of them match the board they are on.  The players then try to get their three pieces into the center space of the same-colored board.Movement is determined by two dice.  The first tells you how many movement points you have.  The second allows for rearrangement of the boards or extra moves.  The larger the piece, the more movement points it takes to move one square.  Only pieces at the top of a stack can be moved unless movement points are used to bring the piece to the top of the stack.  Simple rules but not just a simple game.  Utilizing the special die to best advantage can make the difference between winning and losing.  Gameplay is quick with a single game lasting 10-15 minutes (although it could be even shorter).

KAPLAN ""Penelopecat""","[0, 0]","Veteran artist Mark Wheatley writes and draws an adventure of the classic pulp hero, the Spider, as he tries to stop the evil Cannibal Queen's plot to turn the city's elite into flesh-eating cannibals. Will he succeed? What do you think?Wheatley's art is as fantastic as ever, and really captures the crazy air of weird menace that typified the old Spider adventures (Or so I assume, not having ever actually read any.) Unfortunately, while the writing may very well capture the same spirit, it doesn't make for that fascinating a story. I understand the desire for fans of the old pulps to pay homage to them, but if all we get is a story that's right out of the old pulps, what's the point? Why not just read one of the originals?I love those old stories as much as the next person, and thrill to reprints of the old Doc Savage and Shadow books. But if someone were to write a new story about them today, I'd want it to feel more like a contemporary novel about those characters. Or create new characters that also pay homage to spirit of inventiveness that the best pulp writers displayed.Sadly, this book gives us characters with thin-to-no motivation or background. Lots of crazy ideas and weird imagery, but not enough to hold it all together. It also doesn't really give us the background of the heroes at all, instead presuming knowledge of stories from 60 or 70 or more years ago. (Fortunately, since the story depends not at all on the characters having personalities, that doesn't really matter.)Recommended for long-time fans of the character, I suppose, but for the rest of us, it's no more than a brief diversion.",3.0,Really just for long-time fans,1301270400,"03 28, 2011",Home_and_Kitchen,0.0

But I decided to try them anyway, and proceeded to sanitize them properly.Being a chef for six years has taught me many things. One of which, you should always boil new plastic containers for at least a minute (best at 5 minutes) to remove any contaminants from manufacturing. We get enough plastics and other chemicals in our diets already. And if you are buying for your kid's lunches like I did, you should do this purely for your family's sake.The trick to plastic containers with fitted lids is that after you boil them in plain tap water for at least one minute:1. Remove from boiling water using a pair of tongs or a slotted spoon.2. Tip the container/lid so most of the water drains back into the pot.3. Immediately find it's matching container/lid from the pot, and after draining it as well, put the two pieces together.4. Allow to cool.5. The lid and container should now be a much better fit. They might still be snug, but should be much easier on your fingers.Don't take my word for it though. Please only try one at first to make sure it works as well for you as it does for me.I hope this helps everyone purchasing this product.",5.0,Lid too tight problem is fixable!,1294358400,"01 7, 2011",Home_and_Kitchen,1.0

My plan was to carry them back and forth between work and home (on public transportation) so I needed something that would be small, light, and unbreakable.  I had tried theTupperware Midget Salt & Pepper Shaker NEW Rare Purple, but found that the 2-ounce size of the container was too big, and that it took up too much room at the office and in my tote bag.  This smaller, 1-ounce size was much better for meeting my needs.Luckily, Tupperware makes their products so that the same size lids will sometimes work on similar containers, depending on the size of the lip of the container.  These two products looked like the lids would be interchangeable, so I took a chance and placed the order.  I'm happy to report the shaker part of the original set I bought fits perfectly onto this container.  By the way, the salt and pepper lids work on this set, too:Tupperware Smidget Container 1oz Each Assorted Set 5I have been hunting for a good set of portable salt and pepper shakers for years. By combining these two products, the mission was accomplished!  Note - I plan to re-post this review, with minor variations, on these two other product pages, so if you see it over there, you won't need to re-read the details.Any Tupperware container with a round lid is leak proof, so you can fill them up with small quantities of shampoo, conditioner, mouthwash, toothpaste, etc., and take them on the road, without worrying about leaks.  I have NEVER had a problem with a leak from a Tupperware container with a round lip.  As an added bonus, the containers have a lot of uses.  You can use them to keep your spices fresh.  My mom used to use them to store Wilton icing coloring dyes. They would be good for small quantities of craft products.  They are perfect for maintaining order over the small things that get thrown into a junk drawer.  These things are handy, so this list could go on and on.From my experience with Tupperware, sometimes the lids are a bit tight-fitting when they are new.  If you soak the lid in hot water for a couple of minutes, it will expand slightly, and will easily fit onto the container.  You should only need to do this one or two times; after that, they should fit without pre-soaking.Color - 2 starsThe color is ugly, and I would not call it pink.  It is more of a watered-down version of a coral-like (or maybe salmon-like) tint than pink.  When I saw the color on the computer screen, I thought the color difference between my idea of pink and the reality would be chalked up to the virtual world.  But the reality was worse than the monitor.  :p  Saying this color is ""pink"" isn't even as accurate as saying that ""aquamarine"" is ""green"" or ""blue.""  I'm glad I didn't plan to keep these out on the table.Value Analysis - 3 starsIn the past, it was always been worth paying a little extra for Tupperware because of the superior quality of the Tupperware brand, as well as the lifetime guarantee.  With this order, however, I noticed that the plastic feels slightly thinner and more brittle than the Tupperware containers I bought 20 years ago.  I actually took some of the older containers out and did a side-by-side comparison, and I liked the older ones better.  I'm afraid the containers may not be as durable as they used to be, but they still seem to be very durable.  Tupperware is still superior to most plastics, but the quality of Rubbermaid has improved over the years, and Rubbermaid is much less expensive.  If my Rubbermaid fails, I just throw it out and buy a new one.When I have used the warranty, it has provided a needed replacement for a favorite piece of plastic, and I've been very pleased with the results.  Balance this against the fact that, if I want to return a Tupperware product that fails, I have to pay shipping to send it back to them.  This is often just as expensive as the cost of the item being replaced.  I also have to pay shipping and handling for them to send the replacement back to me.  According to their web site, this is currently (May 2013) a flat rate of $5.75.  (And this assumes that the item can still be replaced, and you don't end up with a substitute.  You may wind up with a replacement of a different color, so the set you have no longer matches.)  I have a few pieces of Tupperware that need to be replaced, but have decided it's just not economical to do so.  So the pieces sit there in the back of the closet while I wait for the pile to grow large enough to make it worth the cost of sending them in and getting them replaced.  I have tried to convince myself to just throw them out, but they don't take up much room. ;)Is Tupperware worth the extra cost?  Yes, but only for especially useful and/or unique pieces.  Personally, I'm planning to seek out this brand only if nothing else will meet the need I have.",4.0,Is Tupperware Worth the Cost?,1367712000,"05 5, 2013",Home_and_Kitchen,1.0

I wanted ice trays with a lid to protect the food in the freezer.  I have not found the opening in the lid particularly useful, but maybe it is when using the trays for ice.  The first time I tried to pop the cubes out, I had a little bit of trouble.  The trays are stiffer than what I'm used to and I had to use some force to twist them.  Once they popped, the food slid right out of the tray with ease, I just had to be careful when twisting that they didn't jump out.  My only complaint is the size of the individual cubes, much smaller than typical ice trays.  I wanted my food cubes to be an ounce for easy tracking of portions, but I believe they are a little under one ounce.

It went through 3 moves with us without being lost - but finally after 10 years in our current house it decided it had had enough of us.  With no party invitations in sight, I decided to look for any kind of citrus peeler on Amazon - and was thrilled to see that several vendors had sets of them available.For anyone who has never used these: you use the sharp part of the teardrop-shaped end to carve lines in the citrus rind - sectioning it into 2 or more sections (for an orange I want to eat, I'll usually make 3 full circles: one around the ""equator"", then two ""pole to pole"". If I'm doing something like making candied peel, I'll usually just go around the equator. Then you use the flat end to slide between the rind and the fruit. The only ""problem"" is that if you have a very thin skinned fruit, the gadget might gouge the fruit itself, so you need to use a lighter touch.All in all, SOOOOO much easier than trying to peel by hand.

They had a display of Lekue items, and the microwave omelet maker first caught my eye since my husband loves omelets. I ended up buying all three products, and they gave me this cookbook for free since I purchased the Ogya pot.This cookbook really is designed to go with the Ogya Steam case, and it has a lot of interesting recipes and works fine with my steam pot.This cookbook is in English, but there are icons next to each ingredient that show what to use, and in the step-by-step instructions, they use the little icons as an aid to tell you what to do in each step.I try not to use my microwave too much, but these products really have made it so much easier to steam fresh veggies and to make entire meals -- like pasta and rice!  In fact, it's really amazing that you can even cook raw meat and dry pasta noodles in just this one dish.At the start of the cookbook is a two-week meal plan that gives you a lot of options for creating fast, healthy meals.  They also give you some tips for buying and storing food.The recipes themselves include things like Chicken and Mushroom Risotto with Basil Oil, Sea Bass with Courgettes and Carrots, Potato Frittata, and Pesto Macaroni.  Since I don't eat meat, I haven't made any of the meat items, but they look like they'd be good.I had never heard of this brand before, but the sales associate mentioned that Lekue is a Spanish company, and all of the products I saw in their line were really ingenious!All of the Lekue products are silicone; they clean up easily, and are also BPA-free.These are such ingenious little devices, and this book provides a lot of creative ways to use their products!",4.0,A fun way to use your Lekue products,1374883200,"07 27, 2013",Home_and_Kitchen,1.0

The image is not exactly the same as what they show you but I posted an image of it.  Overall I would give it about 4.5 stars.,5.0,FF7 Poster,1318896000,"10 18, 2011",Home_and_Kitchen,1.0

So when i saw this fully clad set and the price, impulse took over. VERY happy with it overall.If you aren't aware, cladding is when they sandwich aluminum between layers of stainless steel to provide better heat distribution. Most lower end pots/pans just add a thicker bottom, but these pots are fully clad all the way up the walls just like the high end brands like All Clad. I don't think you can even get a single All Clad pot/pan for this price.What's good:-Fully clad, 1 layer of AL between 2 layers of SS-Nice finish, looks clean and professional-Feels solid, very little flex anywhere-The included non-stick frying pan is actually a great bonus-Handles stay cool and are fairly comfortable.What's lacking-Not quite as thick as more expensive brands (duh)-Lids are very basic (not really a big deal)-Lips are strait, making pouring a tad messierThe frying panI wasn't expecting much, It has dupont's &#34;professional non-stick&#34; teflon. Dupont makes a slew of differently branding levels of its famous nonstick coating and i couldn't nail down which this had and whether it was higher up or lower down on the overall 'quality' scale. Nonetheless it works like a quality non-stick. the first time i used it and cleaned it i could have swore i saw some light brush/scuff marks on the surface, but i haven't seen that since, so i could be imagining things,or it had some initial coating.The pan is a very nice thick anodized aluminum, and is quite heavy (a good thing).There are a lot of opinions about non-stick, but many will be fine with knowing that as long as you dont crank the heat all the way up on it, don't use sharp metal objects on it, and replace it when it's got obvious wear, then it's perfectly fine. I didn't buy the set for the frying pan, but i think it's a darn good bonus that i use frequently. I also found they had a glass lid sold separately that fits it perfectly.The pots3 very useful sizes. The thickness of the walls is a touch thinner than All-Clad/higher end brands, but feels plenty solid, i can flex the walls a bit if i squeeze really hard, but that's not exactly a typical cooking situation. The manual does mention not dousing a hot pot in cold water to avoid warping, thus far i haven't treated them poorly and haven't seen any warping. If i were to make one request it would be to flare the lips on these, which would make for easier pouring. These have a traditional strait lip which is still common on high end brands and looks nice but when pouring liquids you're likely to get a little dribble.The handles are sufficiently comfortable, and while they can get very warm, i've yet to have them get too hot to handle. They also have a hole at the end for hanging.The lidsVery basic, it's clearly where they saved on costs. They are far thinner than the pots but still feel plenty fine, there's a few vent holes for excess steam. i like that the lid handles are recessed, makes for a bit easier storage. The handles do heat up though.$80 for the set breaks down to $20 a piece, that's stoopidly cheap, and a fantastic value. There are a few very nice larger sets in the $150 range on amazon which are potentially an even better value, but for a smaller set, this is great.",5.0,$79 at ikea makes this fully clad set a steal,1399507200,"05 8, 2014",Home_and_Kitchen,1.0

The only issue with the Expedits was that the top of one of them was significantly damaged. It looked like it happened prior to shipping and that something punched a hole in the top the size of a half dollar. The box it was shipped in wasn't damaged in a corresponding spot so it looks like it happened prior to transit. The same box was damaged pretty heavily on one side and then the shelves were damaged in the same spot but I attribute those areas to the shipper since you can tell the box was crushed right there. Luckily, I was flipping these units on their side and recovered the other side to make it a bench so I was able to cover up all the imperfections.

It is, however, a great value especially if you buy it at Ikea.The reason for this is that it is made from Beechwood which is a hardwood and will dull your knives faster than typical cutting/chopping boards, especially end-grain boards from makers like Boos or composite boards from makers like Epicurean.  However, this isn't the best comparison as the price of the Ikea board is a fraction of the Boos or similar, and the burden of touching up your knives a bit more often really isn't too bad.  Anyone serious about their knives does it anyway.I'm very happy with this board in my kitchen and I use it many times a week for doing all sorts of culinary mise en place.  It also raises the level of the counter a bit which is nice.  I'm six-foot and anybody my height or taller will likely appreciate having the added height from a standard home countertop.If your countertops aren't quite flat, or quite level, or have a bevel to them you may have an issue with the board rocking.

Most cases and tall furniture carry a warning to tie this down to the wall to keep it from tipping. I usually take my chances however the Benno DVD towers are really unstable if you do not attach them to the wall. They come with an L-shaped bracket, a screw, and two washers. You will need to supply your attaching device which in my case was an anchor screw.To recap, this furniture looks a lot better than wire racks and takes up the same or less space.

For smaller items you can hold it by the unit body and its a comfortable grip.  But for heavier objects I prefer they had an adapting handle for the top ring.  For my use I just suspended it in the garage.Use/Interface: This is the easiest part.  All you need is three buttons: On/Off, tare (zero), and units.  The units range from kg, lbs, oz, jin with a tolerance of 0.02kg. The instructions do not really state how to use the thermometer; But before anyone disregards that this function is non-existent, simply turn on the unit, allow it to zero, then press and hold the Unit button.  The display will change to temperature, to exit just press the On/Off button.  The units are only in Celsius and is only accurate within a degree.Weighing: This unit is quite accurate and precise.  Taring a 1 Liter bottle and a 2 Liter bottle (and a combination of both): I was able to weigh out water and each coincided with the density of water.  ie a single liter of water equals approximately 1kg of mass (approximate only because of variations in temp, elevation, etc).  Bottom line it is very close and amounted to the same value each time I weighed it.Batteries: I cannot vouch for battery life, but there is no reason to believe why this unit would drain battery life.  The unit itself will shut off in 2 minutes after being left on, regardless of use.

The Screwpull does a fine job with only two simple lever movements of removing the cork.  Wax-sealed corks are another matter.  Wax is a challenge for all types of conventional wine openers including this one.  For operation with wax I recommend removing the screw every 10 bottles and cleaning off the wax in order to preserve its slippery Teflon surface.  When the screw gets coated with wax it is resistive to penetrating a cork, thus it exerts vertical pressure on the cork and drives it inside the bottle - not a good thing when your guests are wearing a white top and you're opening a bottle of red - keep those screws clean, Teflon or not.Other than the wax issue the Screwpull works great and is a nice tool to have in the kitchen.

So when I saw the Screwpull in action, it was a must have. It took several attempts, but now it is so easy, expecially with the hint from a wine store owner friend.  The tendency when opening a wine bottle with this device is to work on a counter or table top supporting the motion.  Wine store owner friend suggested standing clear of a supporting surface and performing the motion in &quot;mid-air&quot;.  I thought no way, I see disaster.  But, it works!  The leverage is more balanced without a surface.  This delightful gadget brings a smile to my face everytime.  No more struggling.  Smooth, easy, and rarely a cork crumble in the wine.  And as in most reviews, your friends will love the performance.

However, my dissappointment in this product prompts me to write one now.  In terms of the materials, it feels like the bed is about $10 worth of thin plastic.  It is held together with eight screws, but with 4 of them you are just screwing directly into the plastic and after it is constructed it does not feel at all sturdy.  The wheels are held on with one screw drilled into just plastic as well, so I give them about 2 months to live.  In addition, as is stated in other reviews there is quite a large gap on all sides between the mattress and bed.  This will undoubtedly be where all small toys go to die.  To further my disappointment, the color (in my opinion) is misrepresented in the photos as a vibrant blue.  It is in fact, Navy Blue; when I was a 5 year old boy and someone asked me what my favorite color was, not once did I say Navy Blue.  The color looks dark and dreary.  In a nutshell, I paid about $350 for a cheaply constructed, unattractive bed.

Another problem: when the cork didn't come out easily, the Rabbit pinched my fingers as I released the cork.Thankfully, after 9 months, the Rabbit gave up the ghost.  The worm unravelled & couldn't be removed.I have just received a new Screwpull from Amazon.  At [$$] it is competitively priced, but price is not the point.

However, the more numerous negative Rabbit reviews reflect my own experience.I have two tips.  When dealing with wax seals, remove the wax before using the corkscrew.  If the worm meets resistance in a cork, revert to an old fashioned corkscrew - the cork may be a high-tech product for which neither product is suited.For those who have never used this type of product, I can say that after 10 years I have never had a cork break.For those thinking of reviewing either product - wait until you have removed 50 corks.",5.0,What was I thinking?,1050105600,"04 12, 2003",Home_and_Kitchen,1.0

Well, looks can fool you.  I also read many glowing reviews about this bed frame, so I was confident that this was a MUST buy.  But after using it for a while (1 year now), I am very disappointed.  If I would buy another bed frame, this one would not be in my shopping list.What I and all my family don't like about this frame :1.  The front end of the car frame is shaped like a sports car, so people hit that protruding part all the time when walking in the room, making people falter sometimes.2.  Since it is made of plastic, it gets really cold, and it really feels terrible.  I don't know why it is damn cold all the time.3.  I had to exchange the regular-height box spring for a half-height one, because the regular-height box spring would be too high and the sides of the bed frame would not provide adequate protection against falling.4.  So many toys and things fall between the mattress and the bed frame.  I have to lift the damn mattress and then go into the car frame to pick up all the junk that my son loves to shove into the little openings.5.  I think the bed frame takes up way too much space for a twin sized bed.  It is waste of space.6.  My son was disappointed that the wheels don't spin.  And I think he has a point, since this bed frame costs so much.  My son now don't even think it's a cool thing.  Well, he stopped liking the bed only after a few days.7.  The head part of the bed is also plastic, and for some reason, your head can go under that plastic, because that head part comes over the mattress.  It is quite annoying, and we had to put another pillow to cover that part of the frame.  And you can't even use it as a shelf since it is not flat.  Dolls and little toys that we put up there would slide down to hit our son or slide to the sides and fall into the corner where there is a big opening between the walls and the car frame.8.  Again, it is very very cold, and it really feels terrible when you want to sleep at night and everything around you is so cold and hard.This is a miserable bed, and I feel bad that I bought this horrible bed for my loving son.

We recently purchased this bed and also bought a high-end very thick twin mattress for this bed for my son. (He is almost 2). I also bought some body pillows and some king-size pillows as others had suggested and stuffed them down the sides. If your child is anything like mine and is active (even in sleep), stuffing pillows is not enough. During the night, my son managed to pull out some very stuffed pillows and was trapped UNDERNEATH the mattress and wooden planks for quite some time before we discovered him. He suffered from some bruises on his head and a swollen eye. He also had some swelling on his forehead because of the way that the wood was pressed into his head from the weight of the mattress. He was also VERY sweaty and in a daze when we pulled him out. We are a very ""safe"" family, always paranoid, and we even have a camera in his room. We never thought that this could happen. I believe that no matter what type of mattress that you buy there will still be sufficient amount of space for any small or skinny child to get caught. We really had a scary episode and I wish to convey our story so that it hopefully will never happen to anyone else. I truly believe that Little Tikes should recall this bed.

It was the  perfect lip so he wouldn't roll/fall out of bed at night.  Both of these  factors made transitioning our son to the big bed easier.The bed is very  sturdy and quite able to stand up to the rigors of a young boy.  It will  undoubtedly last well beyond my son's use.",5.0,The perfect 1st big bed for a toddler!,956448000,"04 23, 2000",Home_and_Kitchen,1.0

I feel the red shelf is worth being mentioned as a separate piece. The front of the box indicates all you need is a screwdriver. It just so happens that the first step is to install four ""AA"" batteries into the light attachment. These are not included. In step two it is mentioned to use a hammer to insert plastic fasteners.The directions are hard to follow because they are in three languages below each other, English, French and Spanish. Initially I placed the three pieces in the proper spots and after perusing the directions several times got frustrated and waited for the ex husband to come visit kids a few days later. In the second step it does mention securing the light bracket. This seemed to confuse the ex because he said these parts were not included. What was included was a plastic bag containing screws, white screw caps and plastic fasteners. Now the terminology changes a bit because it states to align light bracket holes and the ex insisted that I did not have any of these items. It sure looks like the two pieces he had left over but in any event the light is not attached due to confusion. It works better this way as they can move the light to the area they need light in.

My seven-year old is able to sit at the chair and do his homework with comfort and his knees are not at the top of the base, which leads me to believe an eight-year old could still use this.The shelf is fastened to both sides and it seems sturdy thus far. The back row consists of three sections to place markers with the first one for five, the middle holds eight with the right side another five slots. The next section in front of these measures eighteen inches with two rows of five pencils easy to accommodate. The front row has an indentation and is about the same length. Here is where we keep rulers, pencil sharpeners and erasers.While you are sitting at the desk, there is a slot between the desk base and desk-top or a few workbooks to store. A 9"" x 12"" pad will fit vertically but not horizontally in this slot. Each side of the desk base is a wide section for books to fit. We have twelve in one side containing coloring books and practice workbooks for school. The right side is the same size but they cannot accommodate the extra large art pad we have. If you do not store many books than the pages on these art pads will start to curve. We have reading books on the other side.would not suggest using playdoh on this board but it would be perfect for my older son to put together his lego sets. This makes a good desk for reading or doing small puzzles.This was a great addition for my children to store all their supplies in one central location and encourage creativity and art work for the refrigerator. I could not find any warranty card or anything on the instruction sheet pertaining to this. Besides a clip to hold loose papers in place I would have liked to have a slot to keep the lids to the markers as a reminder to place them back on when not in use. A hook on the side would be perfect to keep a cloth/rag to wipe clean after marking up.It does get dusty in the slots, but has been in perfect condition for two years now.  We use the chair to sit at the sand and water play table and store shoes under this table.",4.0,A nice sturdy activity desk for kids,1099699200,"11 6, 2004",Home_and_Kitchen,1.0

Lots of little holes and grooves to store art supplies. 2 cubbys along the floor to store coloring books and papers.

Well let me tell you that the box that it is packaged in is HUGE and it came fully assembled.  It is also a very sturdy toybox, so I guess the shipping would've been somewhat high (but I still dont' think $65).  The toybox is VERY safe. No sharp edges, all plastic, a gap to avoid pinched fingers.  The lid is attached and just slides right up.  I have three huge Disney books (about 10"" high) and they fit perfectly on the bookshelf.  I would recommend a bookend though.  I put her teddy bears on the top shelf with a radio (she likes to listen to nursery rhymes while she falls asleep) and eveything looks GREAT!  Its the main attraction in her bedroom.  I just couldn't think about getting a wooden one!Oh, we put it in my daughters room just yesterday and she tried to climb on top and fell into the box (the lid was open), and didn't even cry.

I have never been able to extract as much clear (the strainer  is small enough to keep the juice virtually pulp-free)juice from fruit as I  have with the LPP juicer. The LPP is easy to assemble, disassemble and  clean (it really is dishwasher safe).Two caveats:  The LPP is a mini  processor, so if you need to make large quanitites you will have to work in  batches. And I find the power cord about 6 inches too short.  But, if you  need/want a processor that works like a full size unit, but doesn't take up  full size space, this a an excellent compromise.",4.0,Full Size Performance at Mini Processor Price,966384000,"08 16, 2000",Home_and_Kitchen,1.0

Even though I have two other Cuisinart food processors that work perfectly well, I thought this would be good for small jobs and I couldn't resist the look. Not only was I not disappointed, but this has become my most-used kitchen appliance. I can mince garlic, make guacomole, turn garbanzos into hummus, and perform a host of other useful tasks. It is perfect if you want to make something quick, and don't won't to drag out the heavier, full-sized food processors. There are some culinary batches that you would ordinarily need to process, but are too small for a full-sized processor - this item is your answer. I have found the pulse control to be superior to the larger processors even - you can custom-chop tomatoes and walnuts (a quite difficult task) to your liking. The reason that I would recommend this specific model over other Cuisinart mini-preps is that this one is truly a miniature version of the full-sized processors - same Cuisinart quality, same original design that has worked for years. I have repeatedly washed the removable parts in the dishwasher with no problems - much easier to clean than any other processor I have used.The only mild complaint I have is that the blade does not seal as well as the larger Cuisinarts - it does make a perfect, restaraunt-quality smoothie, but I would use less than the amount suggested by the recipe book if you don't want a liquidy mess on your hands.

Avoid Black & Decker in the kitchen is my conclusion. Anyway...this Little Honey, that's what I call him, arrived the day before Thanksgiving. Before that I'd only used the B/D to pulverize cat food twice a day. The cats spit out meat or fish pieces they'd have to chew. Waste of money, so they get instant grind instead.What good timing! I put that Little Honey right to work. The slightly larger cup capacity, two speeds, a strong sounding motor of the Cuisinart, and its crisp good looks kept inviting me to whip up quick dips, sauces and icings for unexpected company-- as well as, the morning and evening cat food.The compact size lets me keep it up on the counter. I get more use out of it than my large food processor down in the cupboards somewhere. If it were a little larger I would replace the big processor.Why only 4 stars?I think it is a great little tool, but I am waiting to see how long before the motor burns out. And 4 stars because it does not chop evenly, when I chop such chunky things as celery or certain mixtures of wet cat food large pieces are left.(No, not together! I wash it out well between food types.)Usually I run it until I smell the motor burning then stop. That is after the recommended 10 to 12 seconds, alternating between Lo and Hi speeds. Some other reviewer mentioned the burning smell also, so I assume it is normal...Anyway, if it is still doing this before the warranty runs I will have to send the Little Honey back. For now, I love it very much.",4.0,Great Little Tool!,1198195200,"12 21, 2007",Home_and_Kitchen,1.0

It cleans up quickly and easily, and has a safety locking feature that will not allow the food processor to turn on if the lid is not locked in place (there is a tab at the back of the lid that slides in to a slot on the base that has a sensor in it).I do wish they had also shipped a grater attachment.  However, since the small lid does not have the same chimney-type hole as the larger model, food cannot be inserted while the blade is spinning.  The bowl is also very small.

The unit doesn't have a sturdy/heavy base so it jostles around when running. It's like trying to restrain an epileptic (which you should never do, btw).2. It overheats when you run it for more than 10 seconds. You can smell the burning.3. It's not even remotely water-tight. If the liquid isn't being sprayed everywhere, it's leaking out of the bowl and all over the machine. I mean, a simple salsa shouldn't look like a massacre.4. It doesn't grind evenly. Making powdered sugar, bread crumbs, or a cheese dip is infuriating since you basically have to sift/strain out all the large chunks it missed.5. The blade assembly is easily shifted. You MUST load the bowl AFTER the bowl is on the base or else the blade assembly will shift up, the food will fill that void, and you'll have to reload everything again. It's especially annoying if you accidentally move the blade while shifting the ingredients mid-process.

This unit is really more like a toy.  Very light and cheaply built.  It feels like one of those Chinese things in a discount store or for $19.99 on TV which are always disappointing.  I don't understand other reviewers calling this a ""workhorse"".It cannot do the simplest of tasks well.  Take chopping onions.  Take one small onion, cut into two sections and put into the processor.  It will chop without stalling but the blade and container are not designed well enough to keep the food moving until it's all consistently chopped or puree'ed.  Some sticks to the top of the container and won't get chopped any further.  Some just stays out of reach of the blade and does not get chopped any further.  It leaves large chunks of food intact while the rest is turning into puree.  I find to chop one onion evenly I have to take the lid off and push the food back to the blade maybe 4-6 times, or more.  What a total PITA.  This should be a one-step 3-second procedure.  Helps if you add oil or liquid of course, but you shouldn't have to.  I can do it with my good knife better and faster.  Which should be a lesson.This seems inevitable for all the major brands.  They can't help themselves from covering all market segments and price points.  Even if they do it poorly.  They feel they are immune from mistakes and that poor-quality products won't hurt them in the long run.  I'm sure this units costs them about 3 or 4 dollars to produce in China.  They wholesale it for $15 and are making good money on it.  By the time it's marked up to retail at almost $30, it's a joke.Don't waste your money.  If you are used to the quality of a real Cuisinart food processor or are a serious amateur or pro, you'll be disappointed.

I originally wanted to replace just the bowl as I had broken it, but with Amazon's price of $26.60 total I just had to go for an entire new unit. It was shipped free too.  I ordered the new Black Chrome finish and it really is lovely. My original one was white and this is a very surprising addition to the line for such an inexpensive price!!The only thing I can say from reading the other comments is people are expecting too much from this smallest of food processors.  It is made (and tells you so in the instructions) to be used continuously for no longer than one minute. If you pulse it properly and don't just leave it running, it is fine. This processor is the one I keep under the kitchen cabinet to be used to make small amounts of sauces,finely chop up garlic,chilies, etc. I have a much larger DLC-5 which I use for larger tasks.If someone is purchasing this for the first time I highly recommend sitting down and reading the instruction booklet before proceeding.

I even read the new booklet again, just to make sure if they made any changes.I was most happy to find all these years later, they still manufacture the original unit.

The Cuisinart Mini Prep does not serve well as a primary processor for heavy jobs. That was not its intended design, or function.I obtained my first mini prep as a promotional gift with a DLC-7 purchase. For many years they have been contributing to my cooking enjoyment as a problem-free, complimentary team in a busy kitchen. When their lexan lids eventually chipped, (which admittedly is a major cause of aggravation with Cuisinart's products) I opted to replace them rather than spend up to 50% of their new cost for replacement bowls. I upgraded the old DLC-7 that is still mechanically perfect, with a MP-14 TM Limited Edition.The Mini Prep perfectly compliments larger processors. I specifically elected to stay with Cuisinart's older, boxier design; because its function is favored over the newer, sleeker model, the DLC-2ABC.The mini prep makes delectable, creamy homemade sauces and dressings. It performs equally well making pesto, cr&egrave;med butter, chopped fresh herbs, including garlic, chopped nuts, small portion purees, deviled eggs, spreads, and speedy fresh salsas. It has a fast and slow lever whose function I like because they may be ""pulsed"" on and off with an instantaneous response. This offers a demanding cook tremendous control over several types of prep functions conducive to small processors.Mini Prep seems perfectly designed to make one and a half cup portions of emulsified sauces and dressings, such as cilantro mayonnaise for grilled fish, or a dollop on fresh corn salad.Here is a basic example of how I use this workhorse.Herb mayonnaise:  place dry seasonings, a dab of honey, poupon mustard, flavored vinegars, or lemon/lime juice in the jar. Pulse to mix. Add about a tablespoon (who measures?) of Just Whites, dry pasteurized egg whites to the liquid (no cholesterol, calories, or salmonellae fears) ---pulse to mix---add a hand full of fresh herbs (cilantro, or dill, or tarragon is nice)----pulse to chop slightly. Then use the wonderfully designed lid that holds oil and has two holes on the top that will drizzle in the oil of your choice, without opening the lid, or fiddling with additional attachments that drizzle oil. You have the additional control to shift the motor speed instantaneously from high speed, to slower, or pulse mode, in direct accordance to your temperamental sauce's precise requirement as it thickens.Result: Restaurant quality chef's sauces come together effortlessly in minutes! Large processor's work bowls are too large for this type of job. One must repeatedly scrape the bowl's sides, and the motors are additionally too powerful to make small portions described above as successfully as the Mini Prep's performance.The Mini prep is very lightweight which makes it a delight to store in the pantry. It assembles and disassembles quickly and effortlessly. I especially love the function of the two (tiny) holes on the lid, along with the ease of the lid's removal for ingredient additions. The design and function permit those who love to cook an opportunity to enjoy their creativity in the kitchen without fighting with obstinate, dysfunctional appliances.It is a great convenience and a breeze to use.

I like to use it for small jobs like chopping herbs, parmesan cheese, and for making pesto.  I haven't had any problems with processing parmesan cheese as one reviewer did.  The blade has two sides, a blunt side for processing hard items like parmesan cheese, chocolate, and coffee beans and a sharp side for processing soft items such as onions, garlic, meats, and mushrooms.  The sharp side is labeled sharp.  If you alternate between processing hard and soft items, you have to remember to check the position of the blade to make sure you are processing with the right side.  In addition, the processor has two speeds, HI & LO.  The LO speed is recommended for use with the sharp side of the blade and pulse action while the HI speed is recommended for use with the blunt side of the blade and continuous processing.  The Mini-Prep has a lot of kick to it for such a small appliance, and I have found it best to hold it steady with one hand, particularly when processing hard food items, because it will jump when powered on.One thing I noticed, in the instruction and recipe manual under Operating Techniques, the instructions indicate that hard cheese is processed with a blade and position speed of Blunt/HI but the instructions for grated parmesan cheese in the recipe section uses Sharp/HI.  I pulse at BLUNT/HI and then do continuous hold until its grated like I want it.  For best results, cut the cheese into small pieces as indicated in the instruction manual before processing.The Mini-Prep does a fairly decent job of chopping onions and garlic. On occasion I find a stray piece that the blades missed but that's probably because I don't always cut the pieces as recommended.  Overall, I think this is a great little processor and well worth the price.

As a result of luck only, no one was in its path. Customer service had no real response; they suggested that I pay $20 to replace the broken parts.An examination of the broken blade shows that this is likely to be a recurring problem with this model and any other Cuisinarts using a similar blade. It is clear that this structural failure is due to a lack of reinforcement of the blades at the point of riveting. The removal of material for the placement of the rivets, the thinness of the material, and the large amount of leverage placed upon the rivets by the longer blades led to the structural failure of the part. This failure could have happened at any time, and could have caused severe injury to the user. The tempering necessary to create blades that stay sharp is the same tempering that makes it impossible to have such thin, un-reinforced parts. The blades should either be made of thicker material, or have a wider section in the area of rivet contact to avoid failure.",1.0,DANGEROUS,1263254400,"01 12, 2010",Home_and_Kitchen,0.0

You have to have enough liquid component in addition to the food solids to get the chunks to fall down to the blades and blend.  Otherwise the blade just spins inside a self-created air pocket, and doesn't blend anything.  I think this is fairly typical, but from reading reviews on the Osterizer Beehive and Waring blenders, this is less of a problem.Oh yes, after blending for awhile, one gets that smokey smell from the motor.  But unfortunately, if you don't blend for a while (2-3 minutes), you can't arrive at creamy smooth - not even on the puree setting.Prior to breaking this blender was only a mild disappointment. Now it's a total disappointment.",2.0,broken in 2 years,1239062400,"04 7, 2009",Home_and_Kitchen,0.0

(which was not disclosed on the technical information).  The cord was thin, and only had two prongs at the end, in comparison with my old Waring blender with a very thick black cord and  3 prongs at the end for heavy duty performance.My enthusiam dampened, I put an inch of freshly peeled and thinly sliced ginger in the blender, went first topuree, then to liquify, then with no decent results went through all of the  different selections and barely got useable results.  I then put in a half of bunch of parsely, (unchopped)  read the instruction booklet, tried the selections for different speeds, and end up with chopped parsley flakes everywhere.  Unwilling to give up in spite of failed attempts, I added my berries, and applesauce. Berries, sweet, soft berries, and soft applesauce. I pureed, I liquidfied, I went through all the speeds, and ended up with bits of berries, ginger, and tons of parsely flakes everywhere and produced the worst unblended drink in my blending career.  Perhaps most people don't blend fresh ginger and parsely (so-o good for you and tasty too), but my old waring blender has been making this drink for me for years, giving me smooth pureed results each time.Hindsight being better than foresight, I realized I allowed myself to be seduced with the very nice new shape of the blender jar, thinking it would work much better than the old shape, and the new ""touch pads"" .  Wrong on both counts.  The wide shortened new shape looks great, but somehow doesn't work as well as the narrow original shape of the blending jars.  The touch pads are a pain to use, and you have to be in the right light to see if you've turned the machine on or if it's off.

I would absolutely buy another (and just did, after nearly 3 years with the first one).  It has worked well from day one.Now that it died in the way a lot of people describe, I understand what happened and probably what is happening to others.All of a sudden, out of the blue, we heard the motor working very hard while mixing up some frozen Pina Coladas.  We tried everything, but it just got worse.  Suddenly, it stopped working at all.Here is the problem:  It is not the mixer, it is the container.  What changed in 3 years is, we finally replaced our old noisy dishwasher and instead of hand-washing the container as we'd done in the past 3 years, we put it in the new, quiet dishwasher.  THAT RUINED IT.  What happens is, the spinning blade mechanism seizes up.  Maybe there is something in there, a gasket or metal part, that cannot handle the high heat of a dishwasher.  It seizes up to the point where you can't freely spin it.  (Go to the store, check a new one; when you lift the container off, spin the bottom part from underneath, that also spins the blade.  It spins freely.  That's the way it is supposed to operate.)If this part seizes, the motor WILL attempt to turn it anyway.  But it struggles, effectively trying to push a locked part, and if you don't catch it in time, it WILL burn out your motor as a result.We are now making it a habit to CHECK that the blades freely spin before using it.  AND ALWAYS HAND-WASH THIS CONTAINER.  NEVER USE THE DISHWASHER.I fully expect this replacement to last another 3+ years.  Other than this issue (which we now understand), it has been bar-quality and always mixed crushed-ice drinks perfectly, provided you don't over-load the amount of ice (which is improper mixing, not the blender's fault; you have to find and remember the ratio of liquid to ice that works; even commercial machines will seize up if you use too much ice).",5.0,Best Blender I Ever Owned - Bar Quality > IMPORTANT: Hand wash container or it will seize!,1245974400,"06 26, 2009",Home_and_Kitchen,1.0

At $25 (shipped) a pop, the SPB-456-2 blades aren't cheap but their engineering IS.The blender itself has proven to be pretty tough after 5 years of using it 3~5 times a week but their blades simply cannot withstand frozen items.  It worked excellently for the first 3 years of use when it was just milk/yogurt and protein powder but now that I've started freezing bananas and breaking them intop 4/5 pieces and blending them and frozen strawberries in the blender, the blades have been breaking left and right.The base of the blade that grabs the spinning rubber ""teeth"" that are on the main drive shaft is made of plastic and threaded onto the main spinning shaft of the blade assembly. Apparently this plastic base screws onto the shaft and if something in the blender catches the teeth just right, it'll strip the plastic base of the blade assembly rendering it useless. The base of the blade assembly will spin freely.I've got JB weld curing on my latest stripped blade so we'll see if that fixes it but the 5th and final replacement blade is on the way and a new Oster fusion blender (with all metal blade assembly and coupling construction) will be under my Christmas tree in a few weeks. The cuisinart will stick around simply because the food processor still works and the blender itself will be used for backup if needed.Also, the hard plastic covering that covers the button area is cracking where the more commonly pressed buttons are located.  They should have used rubber or real buttons.Lesson learned. If you make frozen drinks with frozen bananas or frozen strawberries, look elsewhere.If you don't plan on making frozen drinks, it's decent but when you can pay less for a blender that CAN mix anything you put in there, why even bother with the more expensive cuisinart?

Before opening the box, I went to Amazon to see how it was being reviewed, and was somewhat concerned at all the bad reviews.I nonetheless decided to open it, and have used it several times so far to make smoothies to good results.Granted, I've only had it for a couple of weeks, so I could be disappointed in the future, but I did want to address my own experience about a few things that recurred in the reviews.-One person said the jug has no pour spout. Perhaps Cuisinart have changed the design somewhat, because mine certainly has one, although a bit small. But overall, no problems pouring into glasses.-Several people have mentioned that the blades just spin at the bottom and that in order to get them to actually blend things, you have to keep pushing things down with a spoon. This has completely not matched my experience. I followed the instructions to use the ""liquefy"" speed for smoothies. When using fresh fruit they were completely and smoothly liquefied within approximately 20 seconds. When I used frozen fruit it took a little longer (a couple of minutes). In both cases I didn't need to use a spoon to push them down.-I did learn after a couple of uses that it's very important to make sure that the jug is pushed in all the way before you use it, because otherwise the plastic blade-spinning device may just spin in the air or may work but with tiny bits of plastic coming off it. When the jar was pushed all the way in, I had no problems with this. However, I am keeping a close eye on that plastic bit because it seems to be the cause of most problems here.So overall to date I'm happy with my purchase.

The gears are plastic as is the base of the cutting assembly.  What happened is the plastic got so hot from about 3-4 minutes of continuous blending, it started slowing down.  The plastic was melting and fusing itself together and once I turned it off, it had permanently fused the plastic gears on the cutting assembly to the base of the assembly making it worthless.  I could spend $15 to get a new one but I know this will just happen again so why bother.For this price point, I do not recommend this product, at ~$20, I would recommend this product.

One day, it simply stopped rotating the blade.

I would estimate that we have used it 30 times, tops.  I can not recommend this product because of a fault in its design.  The motor drive is especially a long screw made of metal with threads at its end.  The threads are used to attach itself to a hard black plastic wheel with teeth/groves.  The metal used, however, is soft and brittle that will break thus not allowing the motor drive and wheel to be attached.  This leaves a nice looking blender that has a perfect motor & attachments only it doesn't blend because of this poor design.I did take pictures to better explain the issue with the Cuisinart blender as well as my replacement with a better design.I have alternatively replaced the Cuisinart Blender with a an cheap Oster 6803 about a month ago (bought from WalMart for $24).  It is not as pretty as the Cuisinart but it has double the available speed @ 14 speeds, breaks/blends ice within smoothies better, and its motor drive is a much better design.

Cleaning is minimal, setup is a breeze, and the coffee is great, even a few hours later.-- For ground coffee, it's even easier to set up, and the grinder does a great job. It's also no louder than any other grinder I've used (which is not to say it's quiet -- our cat has been known to jump three feet when the beans start grinding).-- The customer service is wonderful. When I dropped the inner lid (that protects the bean and filter departments), I emailed Cuisinart to ask how much a replacement was (as it was clearly my fault). They promptly sent me a new one, at their expense, even paying for shipping.The bad:--As you've no doubt seen from other reviews, the bean compartment is a trick to clean. That said, it's not the worst thing in the world. Take it out, run it under water for a few seconds, and you're set. Let's face it -- if you grind beans in a moist environment (like a coffeemaker), it's going to be messier than grinding them in a dry standalone grinder.Honestly, that's the only bad point.

It worked pretty well but I never got over wondering if washing and drying five different parts each day was really worth it.  Well, in the end I had no choice but to get rid of it, because the rubber tube inside the machine that brought the heated water from below the burner plate to the top of the unit developed a crack and leaked water onto an interior electrical connection, which caused the wire to the burner plate to overheat and burn out.  When this happened the machine made a loud ""pop"" noise, which was followed by this awful metallic burned smell that one always associates with electrical fires. I went out to the kitchen to find my counter flooded with warm water (not hot, mind you: the machine never got the water hot enough), and the plastic around the hot plate melted to the point that the hot plate was sinking.  I called Cuisinart to report the problem as a concerned consumer and all the company seemed to care about was whether the machine was under warranty, which of course it wasn't.  The rep said she would tell her supervisor but I doubt she ever said anything.  She never ever took the model or serial numbers.  These companies love to blame consumers for stupidity or negligence, but this is how they respond when you report a problem out of common courtesy!Learn from me and do not buy this machine!

First, there are several parts to clean and dry, which means that I often put off cleaning the coffee maker. I find that cleaning in the dishwasher frequently leaves debris in some of the parts; hence, hand cleaning is a must.

My adjustment to that was to put in one extra tbsp of coffee beans over and above one tbsp per cup. So if my water line is 6 cups, I put in 7 Tbsp of beans. Works fine. I really like the fact that you can turn off the grind function in case you have leftover ground coffee in the freezer or if you can't get a certain flavored coffee in the bean format, and that is nice.The cleaning thing really doesn't bother me. Yes, it's kind of a pain if you were only used to cleaning a pot and a filter basket before, but if you consider how much better the coffee turns out, to me the extra time is worth it. I make my coffee in the morning, turn off the pot, and wash everything out that night when I get home from work. It's fine.Above all, the thing that is the best for me is that it has tamed my Starbucks addition, and that's a good thing!

Much worse, they must be cleaned and thoroughly dried before  you can make a second pot. Therefore you can't simply brew a second pot  without first doing the dishes.  Secondly, it makes...[bad] coffee.  There  is a small knob inside that you can turn to adjust the brew strength. It  goes from watery to ridiculously watery.  Maybe our particular unit is  flawed.

Greenberg,"[114, 115]","Review revised on April 24, 2002My initial review:My wife and I have been using this machine for several months now, and we have become familiar with the good, the bad, and the ugly, as these terms relate to this worthwhile but flawed innovation by Cuisinart.The good: the coffee made by the machine is wonderful, IF you have the common sense to adjust the amount of beans you use in accordance with how strong you like your coffee. The people who complain that the coffee is ""weak"" need to put on their proverbial thinking caps and simply ADD MORE BEANS! Yup, once you get the right ratio of beans to water the coffee is plenty strong, and since it's freshly ground, the flavor is terrific. The automatic brewing features are reasonably easy to set and use, and these make it possible to wake up in the morning to freshly brewed coffee, a terrific start to any day. Complaints about how hard it is to clean the machine are also kind of silly; have we gotten so spoiled as a culture that we can't stand to routinely remove and rinse out the necessary parts of a kitchen appliance after every use? Cleaning the removable parts takes a couple of minutes, true, but it's definitely not such an odious task that it should discourage potential purchasers.The bad: the construction of the unit itself needs some improvement; after two months of routine, reasonably careful use, the top of the machine broke off, due mainly to what seems to be a flimsy hinge design. Fortunately, it was still possible to affix the top to the unit during the time we waited for a replacement part.The ugly: possibly the most annoying feature of this machine is that normal cleaning of the unit caused the lettering that labels the various buttons to disappear. We now have memorized the function of each button, but it would have been nice and probably not difficult for the engineers at Cuisinart to design more permanently affixed labels.It's likely that over time, new versions of this machine will be marketed that improve on this one. In the meantime, this is a good, affordable, and reasonably reliable unit that exhibits how clever engineering can help to move us ever closer to that ""perfect home-brewed cup of coffee.""Added April 24, 2002:I feel compelled to inform those few readers who will ever come across this revised review that my initial commentary on this Cuisinart grind and brew unit was overly generous.  No, it wasn't the cleaning process that got to me; I was always willing to accept a little routine maintenance in order to end up with great coffee.  The problem is that this unit simply isn't designed to stand up to everyday use over any extended period of time.  I've already mentioned the disappearing labels for the various buttons.  But after ten months or so of daily use, the machine stopped doing a trustworthy job of sending the ground coffee on to the brewing basket.  No matter how thoroughly we cleaned and prepared the unit, every morning we would find a large percentage of the ground coffee still stuck in the grinder.  The result was weak coffee and frayed tempers. We still use the machine, but only for brewing already-ground coffee, and there certainly are cheaper machines that will perform this task adequately.Also, I should explain to people that whereas you can get adequately strong coffee by using more than one measure of beans per cup, this essentially transforms the ""ten cup"" machine into a four or five cup unit.I hope that the folks at Cuisinart will take all of this customer feedback and commentary and put it to good use, i.e., a renewed effort to redesign this machine so that it is more reliable, durable, and flexible in terms of brew strength.",2.0,A revised verdict: not reliable and durable enough,978307200,"01 1, 2001",Home_and_Kitchen,0.0

That must have something to do with the foreign manufacturing? Someone mentioned that the coffee tasted watery. I agree and though I increased the coffee strength it did not really improve. I only made 2 or 3 cups each use. One time I made about 5 cups and the tase was good. However the coffee no longer drains into the decanter. The water sits in the filter and slowly drips into the decanter. I checked for clogs and I checked to see if the decanter was misplaced. It took 20 minutes for the mugs worth amout of coffee water to filter through. I've tried brewing with and without a paper filter several times and it no longer works correctly.

But when I put the coffee maker together originally, the different parts associated with the grinder/filter and basket worried me a little (as far as durability). If the parts are not aligned properly in the reservoir, it will not brew; or worse will leak brewed coffee all over your counter top. I do agree that the grinder basket size does limit the amount of beans you can put in, and therefore the strength of the coffee. If you like strong coffee (like the reviewer from New Orleans) and you would like to make a 10 cup pot, I do not think you will be able to make it as strong as you would like. As with other reviewers, I do find that there is alot of ground coffee left in the grinder and filter basket after brewing , and that I am going through alot of coffee beans. Like most users, I am usually in a hurry when making coffee, so am unable to completely dry the three different parts before brewing. I agree that cleaning the three different internal parts is somewhat tedious; but if done the night before not too much of a big deal. Before buying, you should be aware that there is more daily cleaning than traditional coffee makers.I do find that the warming plate does keep the coffee pretty hot, I have mine turned up all the way. I have noted that this seems to be a complaint that multiple folks have had (coffee too cool.) Perhaps my previous machines had very poor warming plates.The one thing that I am not reading on other reviews that happens to my machine is this: sometimes it does not utilize all of the water to brew the coffee. Even when the 'Coffee Bar Flavor System Dial' is set to 10 or is off, sometimes there are about 4 cups of water left in the machine. Maybe it is clogged...? It still seems to brew rather weak coffee when it does this as well.The other thing is that the carafe does not seem to sit properly against the basket-so it drips VERY slowly when brewing. (Even when it seems to be sitting on the warming plate correctly.) I have tried to investigate/fix this by making sure the basket is in the machine all the way. It only seems to drip properly if the carafe is held against the little brew-pause mechanism under the basket. A few times it has even had  a hard time sensing that the carafe was not there when I have poured coffee mid-brew, and it kept on dripping (which we all know from older makers is a complete pain....we want our coffee ASAP without it making a huge mess on the warming plate!)All in all, I think that I will look for a different model when this kicks the bucket (which may be sooner than later from what I'm reading.)It brews a decent cup of coffee, but I have not been able get it strong enough for my taste.",2.0,"Ok coffee, but somewhat tedious",1200182400,"01 13, 2008",Home_and_Kitchen,0.0

So far, (1) the cover latch has broken.  For a while, we held the cover down while it was grinding, but I eventually disassembled the unit and bypassed the safety switches.  Now I just have to remember to have all the parts in place before pushing the start button!  (2) The heater element failed.  To repair this, I disassembled the unit and re-soldered a connection.  (3) The motor bearings froze up.  Probably this is because of all the moisture that circulates inside the machine every time it's used.  It was a pain to get the motor out to oil it.  That did fix the problem, but only for a few months, and we've been using pre-ground coffee since then.

It's height requires us to place it in only one spot on our counter where it doesn't bump under the top cabinets, and even there it slightly pushes under on the top lid when setting it back - I think that must be due to a flaw in the evenness of our counter. Our top cabinets are about 14 3/4"" high.But the main pain is the cleanup between pots. You have to break down the inside into the three main pieces - the grinder top, the water system, and the basket/grinder cup combo. Each piece becomes crusted with wet grounds and it's a mess to rinse off. And of course you have to make sure the parts are completely dry again before making another pot. I'm also not sure that the grounds that wash out are good for our septic system. So, if you are having company and making 2-3 pots, it's a lot more work than just dumping the filter and refilling as in conventional machines.I also agree with the person who mentioned the grounds (and we have beans) in the water tank. Your hand won't fit in and there's an additional 4th plastic piece that goes in there which I haven't figured out what it's for.I also read in another review that you can program the shutoff. But ours didn't come with any built-in shutoff, so there's a definite risk that you could leave with the unit still on. This also results in skanky coffee - if my wife gets up early on the weekend and I get up later, I'm often getting an aged cup of caffienated acid from the bottom of the pot. If it were a normal two-hour auto-shutoff, at least I'd be forced to make a new pot first. I'll have to see about programming a shutoff, but then of course if the power goes out or you remove it, you'd need to reset it.OK. That's 4 things. On it's plus side, it does make a good cup of coffee, but frankly I'm not enough of an aficionado to distinguish between freshly ground beans vs. the beans I grind in the store and bring home and use up in a week +/-. I just want a good cup of coffee or three when I get up and easy cleanup.This machine would be good if you have high top cabinets or a space to put it, make one pot of coffee per day, like to buy exotic beans, and don't mind washing several tbsps. of grounds down your drain every day.If you want to make multiple pots, and don't want to spend 5+ minutes cleaning and drying equipment between them, and want an auto shutoff, you'd be better served getting a simpler machine (and maybe a separate grinder).Oh yeah - the carafe does always drip as another review mentioned.",2.0,for the one-pot aficionado,1080604800,"03 30, 2004",Home_and_Kitchen,0.0

We were in love!  The coffee is amazing, better than anything you can get at St@rb*cks and waking up to freshly ground, freshly brewed coffee is a fine motivator to get out of bed in the morning.I like that you can set the length the hot plate stays on all the way up to 4 hours as well the ability to adjust the temperature of the hotplate.  In the winter I like my coffee scalding but in warmer months I prefer it a bit less heated.Cleaning the machine - why is this an issue for people?  It literally takes seconds to rinse the parts off under the tap.  You don't want to use soap in a coffee maker ever.  We use a kitchen scrub brush to rinse all the grounds off under the tap and then DRY THOROUGHLY before putting it back together.  Not drying tends to cause the grounds to not transfer properly into the basket.Complaints:Honestly, 4 years wasn't enough time for me.  I feel it should have lasted longer and even then, for two of those years, we were limping along having to coax it into operation most mornings.  After a while some water or something got into the computer and we could no longer set the time or use any of the computerized controls, but still we pressed on.  Eventually even our tricks to bypass the quirks stopped working and we threw it out.  We plan to buy another very soon but are debating the thermal carafe version vs this one.This is a great machine, a bit over priced for the life span, but hopefully Cuisinart will pull their heads out of their nethers and make one that doesn't suck quite so much.

I soon discovered what a pain it was cleaning the grinder, etc., so I quit using the grinder part, and ground my beans in a separate grinder. What I discovered was that this coffee maker, for whatever reason (maybe the so-called ""coffee bar flavor"" system?) made really good FULL flavored coffee.  As the years went on, stuff stopped working on it (the grinder and warming plate), but the coffee continued to be great. Eventually, I had to unplug it at night in order for it to work at all in the morning.  Otherwise, it simply would not turn on.  Once I discovered this, I kept it going for another year or so.  In the mean time, I bought 2 highly recommended coffee makers.  A Cuisinart DCC1200 (I think that was the model number), and a Capresso MT500.  They both looked fantastic, but for whatever reason, would not brew strong full flavored enough coffee.  I did side by side comparisons, using exact same amount of my bold Trader Joes coffee, exact same amount of water, exact same grind.  The old Cuisinart always won, hands down.  Some how the shower head design is able to extract more flavor.  The used grounds are concentrated at the bottom of the filter (I user paper - gold tone filter makes weaker coffee), unlike the other makers, where the grounds seemed to ""bloom"" all over the place and rose almost to the top of the filer.  Anyways, today, I was at Macy's and noticed they are still selling this (in black), even though Cuisinart web site says this is a long discontinued model.  So, I bought one (cheap!!), and tried it out.  I immediately pressed the Grinder off button [I will never use it again] and made coffee.

No, it doesn't make bad coffee. No, you can't just dump coffee beans or ground coffee into the coffeemaker and make good coffee automatically.The Coffee Bar, as Cuisinart likes to call it, does have several internal parts which must all be in place before you can brew coffee.  You can use ground coffee, but you're defeating the purpose of the Coffee Bar by doing so.  The grinder compartment can hold enough beans to make 10 strong 6-oz cups of coffee which is what &quot;10-cup&quot; usually means with appliances.  I like my coffee very strong and I've been able to load more than enough beans into the coffeemaker to get the strength of coffee I want.Between the grinder and the attached drain basket is an attached screen through which the ground beans goes through and an inserted gold basket filter which must be in place in order to make coffee.  On top of all of this is a cover which fits over the basket into which hot water is pumped up over the grounds and then drips down into your fresh grounds.On this cover, there is a dial setting which you must set each and ever time depending on the amount (and what I've discovered -- strength) of the coffee you want to have.  Finally, this entire assembly is covered by a lid attached to the rear of the coffeemaker and latches in front.The entire internal assembly MUST be cleaned after each and every brewing.  So, yes, if you make multiple pots, you need to clean it each time.  (However, is this any different than any other coffee appliance?)There are additional settings on the front of the coffeemaker that also affect the quality of the coffee; so, basically, the coffeemaker is NOT intuitive and you have to read the instruction manual before you start brewing coffee with this appliance.All of that said, this coffeemaker makes EXCELLENT coffee.  I own two of them, because I originally purchased the version in white, because it was all that was available.  When the version in black became available, I bought a second one.  Both are still in excellent working condition and I haven't had any problem with either.The Cuisinart Coffee Bar is a little pricey, but it does make great coffee and I heartily recommend it.",4.0,"Pricey, but good coffeemaker",975715200,"12 2, 2000",Home_and_Kitchen,1.0

If I use this coffee maker as a regular standard type maker then cleaning is no different than any other.  What everyone is talking about for cleaning, is when you use the system to grind beans and make coffee.  As the hot water goes through the coffee grounds after it grinds, the steam condenses all through out the system making the residual ground in the grinder wet.  So, after making coffee in this manner, it needs to be taken apart and rinsed (a very simple process).  If you like coffee then this is a good system for the price.

Features like the programmable timer, water heat selection, self clean are all useful, but what makes this a great coffee maker is that it grinds the coffee and passes hot water through it within seconds of finishing the grind.  That you can program this so you can have fresh ground and brewed coffee waiting for you in the morning is one of the finer things in life.The downside is that the entire grind and brew basket gets covered in grounds and must be cleaned and dried after every use.

I used to drink only Maxwell House Master Blend.  Recently it seemed to be going bad faster than I could drink it, so I decided to give this coffee maker a shot.  It was given to us by my mother-in-law.First the pros:1) Works as advertised - It really does do everything it says it can, and once you have everything setup it works wonderfully.2)Programmable - A unique featuer here is that it can grind the beans on the timer as well, which is very nice.3) Option to not grind - This is nice for those times when you get a bag of ground coffee somewhere else.  This way the grinder doesn't spin with nothing in it.4 Coffee Pot - The coffee pot has a nice lid that is unlike anything I've ever seen.  It has a kind of flip hinge at the lip that helps direct the coffee while you are pouring, preventing spills.5) Flavor system - A selectable dial allows you to tell the pot how many cups you will be making.  In reality all this is is a knob, that when you turn it to the lower cup settings it increases the flow of water into the filter basket, allowing the water to go through smaller amounts of grounds at a similar pace to larger amounts.6) Temperature selector - You can tell it how hot (on a slding scale) you want the coffee to come out.  The water is heated more or less, then the hot plate is set to a higher or lower temperature.  I set it to come out very hot, since I then transfer the coffee to a thermal carafe.Ok, and here are the reasons that I will possibly be switching to a different one:1) Not convenient - When you go through sometimes 2 pots of coffee a day you have to clean the grinder lid, basket lid, and the filter basket/grinder bowl.  Each of these parts should ideally be dry before you actually use it, to allow the ground coffee to not stick while it is being directed into the filter basket.2) Lack of thermal carafe - After using a thermal carafe and having hot coffe that tastes the same for 4 hours, I am sorely dissapointed to have a unit again that is a glass carafe with a hot plate.  I have a thermos carafe that I pour the coffee into, and this works fine, but it is just one more step to do, one more piece to keep clean ,etc...Actually, I think that is it.  If it weren't for these two problems, I would be sold.  Here is how my typical pot of coffee goes with my old coffee pot, versus with the Cuisinart.I have a cheapo Black & Decker TCM700 coffee pot.  I love this thing.When I used this my daily coffee went like this:1 - Pull out the filter basket,2 - Empty the basket, rinse it out, and replace,3 - Put in new paper filter, fill with ground coffee,4 - Rinse out thermal carafe, fill with water, pour water into resivoir.5 - Turn onAnd here is what I have to do with the Cuisnart:1 - Pull off the grinder lid and assembly lid, rinse both these out.2 - Pull out grinder/filter basket assembly, rinse these out.  Keep in mind that cleaning these parts is more difficult, because you actually have finely ground coffee that tends to stick to them.  To truly get all the residue off you can't just rinse them off, you have to wash with soap and water.3 - Dry off parts.  At the very minimum the grinder lid, and the area where the coffee flows should be dry.4 - Measure out beans and put assembly together5 - Rinse out carafe, and fill resivoir with water6 - Start brewing7 - Turn off machine, pour coffee into thermal carafeAll in all this is a nice coffee pot, if you don't drink a lot of coffee.  I know some people will say that I can just use preground beans, but doesn't that kind of defeat the purpose of having a grinder built in?

However, I tried it again, and I was so thrilled with the convenience and TASTE of the coffee, that I rarely use my French press! Yes, you need to keep the Cuisinart clean; but cleaning a French press is a necessary routine as well. I love the fact that I can wash the parts, let them dry, and then set up my machine to have coffee ready, waiting and DELICIOUS when I stumble downstairs.A note of advice and experience; my program function died after about a year and a half.

First, the programming never worked, or I'm too dense to figure it out.  Second, the whole contraption--water, grind, brew--is under one lid so the steam gets into the grinder and clogs the thing up each time.  Also, there is no way to clean the water container, which gets all kinds of coffee debris in it from the grinder.  It says it has a self-clean function but this does nothing as far as I can tell.  Also, if you don't have all the parts in perfectly it beeps at you incessantly until you unplug it!  Now it won't even make coffee--it just beeps and beeps and beeps and I can't figure out why.

I don't think any more than the number of parts involved in cleaning a separate grinder and a coffee maker!  The upper lid, the grinder lid, the filter itself, and the lower assembly (which includes the grinder and filter areas - this is a boon, not a bane: you get to rinse out all that leftover grind and coffee, not add it to your next batch.  Make sure you DRY it all! (*see below)2) The design of the carafe is terrible.  When pouring, you must pour SLOWLY to ensure it doesn't spill everywhere.  If you have patience and take the time to learn how to pour, it's not too terrible.3) The grinder is part of the same unit, and like any convergence electronic, this means that if the grinder motor goes (as it finally did in mine - *see below), you've got a run of the mill coffee maker with extra parts to clean, and no inexpensive way to replace the grinder other than get a separate one.The Pros:1) Not just fresh brewed, but fresh GROUND coffee.  There is a BIG difference, and a unit like this comes through with a good flavor first thing in the morning.  If you read the instructions, and make sure to set it all up right, you'll be pleased with the result.2) Slick looks.  We've taken to calling ours ""Darth Coffee.""  Yes, its too big to stow, but it makes up for this by looking good, and really, if you brew coffee every day, and set it up every night... why would yo be stowing it?*and here's the ""see below"":3) None of the problems anyone else has listed will happen IF you make sure to follow the manual.  The grinder failing?  Make sure to dry the parts before reassembling! It actually states in the manual that not doing so can and will get water in the motor and fry it.  If you don't make sure to have the lid on the carafe?  The lever that closes off the drip (so you can take a cup before it's done brewing) wont open, and you'll have the issue of it overflowing (yes, that's the problem!).  Once you get it overflowing?  Coffee, hot coffee, pours over the top.  Gets into the display, the buttons, and the grinder.  My uncle had his display go - after the machine repeatedly overflowed because *he didn't put the lid on the carafe!*  The beeping?  The machine beeps when you don't put all the parts in place.  I suppose it is possible that people here are having the sensor fail, but it's likely they are suffering the same issue many of my visiting friends have when trying to use ""Darth"": not putting all the parts back, and seating them properly, will result in the system beeping at you and not running - again listed in the manual.So, I suppose that's also a con: complex parts, and complex operation, but both are a result of the design being easily cleanable by removing so much of the unit, with the added danger being increased risk of user error, both in simple re-assembly, and in exposing parts to liquid that can and will cause failure.This is an old, old design now, but refurb units are still available.  If you're looking for something that does all the things the new ones do, at a discount, don't pass this one by just because of reviews pointing out flaws that can be over come with reading the instructions and proper maintenance.",4.0,"Read the manual, and you'll have better luck",1249862400,"08 10, 2009",Home_and_Kitchen,1.0

I remember that we never succeeded at making ice cream.  The result of a half hour of concocting and endlessly turning the crank was an unfrozen milk mixture that had many large frozen ice crystals in it that was hardly recognizable as ice cream.  It was more like what you get when you accidentally let store bought ice cream thaw completely and then re-freeze it.Naturally, I was a bit skeptical about this when I saw it showcased on Amazon's front page.  After reading many rave reviews and checking out what else was available in the ice cream maker arena, I gave it a shot.  I was pleasantly surprised when after about 25-30 minutes of spinning I got ice cream that was about the consistency of soft serve.  The amazing thing was how good it tasted, especially if you knew how limited my cooking skills are.  The ice cream maker is still my favorite way to mate dessert even after a year.  Definitely worth every last dollar.A few suggestions:  Ice cream and any frozen dessert you may make freezes best if you either use chilled ingredients for recipes that involve no cooking, and when they do need heating it helps quite a lot to thoroughly chill the mixture to near freezing before transferring to the device.  Being a chemist, the approach I naturally took was the same as in lab: put a smaller container (mixing bowl) with the hot ice cream mixture inside a bigger container (slightly larger mixing bowl of the same shape) filled with about two or three dozen ice cubes + water.  If one stirs the mixture every few minutes, it's ready to freeze in no time.If the result of the ice cream maker is not solid enough in the suggested freezing time of 20-25 minutes, I've found that letting it mix up to about a maximum of 40-45 minutes continues to harden your frozen dessert. (Coincidentally, there seems to be an auto shut-off at that same time - presumably to prevent burning out the motor) Beyond that sitting 2-3 hours in the freezer will give you completely solid ice cream.Also I suggest taking the time to try to cook a custard.  It may take more than one attempt to get it right, but if you do the treat is well worth it.  Vanilla custard is by far my favorite ice cream now and no store bought ice cream can compare!  There's a recipe for Philly soft serve that's great as well and is not as tricky (recipes for both were found in a book called Frozen Desserts by Caroline Liddell).  A friend of mine apparently found the ideal way to cook a custard with such an ice cream maker.  He apparently got his hands on an old hot plate with a magnetic stirrer that was being tossed at his lab.  He says it works great: you set the thermostat to the right number, turn on the stirrer and it maintains a constant 180 degrees Fahrenheit just like in lab.  And your custard is done cooking in 15 minutes with virtually no risk of curdling by overheating.

There are absolutely delicious concoctions that aren't available commercially.  Just made some chocolate almond and lemon ice creams for Christmas dinner.  The process only fails for three basic reasons.  The first is that the bowl isn't cold enough.  If your freezer is about zero degrees F (the CR-recommended freezer temp), the bowl will be cold enough if it's been frozen for at least 24 hours.  Of course if you have a separate freezer in the basement, you can just leave it in there.  The second is that the recipe is wrong.  The third is that the mix isn't cold enough.  After being in the fridge for 2.5 hours, I put the mix in the freezer for an additional half hour before I put it in the machine.  Some recipes take longer to freeze than others.  Many times the 20-30 minute processing time is too short.  But if the bowl has been well frozen, it won't become isothermal with the mix for at least an hour, so don't be bashful about letting it go on longer.  The final product will frequently be a little on the soft side and just needs a couple hours in the freezer to set up properly.

But, I will be replacing it soon with an electric machine that is self-contained for a number of reasons.This machine only makes soft serve ice cream.

Be certain to start with a very cold base ice cream, or the ice cream will not even reach a soft serve state.This machine is not quiet.  It makes much more noise than it would appear capable of generating.In order to be able to make ice cream the freezer compartment needs to be solidly frozen.

I also make my ice cream base the day before so that it will be completely cold when it enters the ice cream canister.If you plan to add nuts or fruit to your ice cream do this after the base has reach a soft serve state to keep the nuts and fruits from getting broken up to fine, unless that is your intention.If you make ice cream, sherbet, or sorbet infrequently this machine will suit your need.  If you don't currently make ice cream at home and just want to try to make ice cream to determine if a machine will get used, this item would also make sense.

I had read the reviews here on amazon and requested it as a gift from my sister. She was skeptical about buying it because she didn't believe it would work. The first time I used it I let the freezer bowl freeze for the minimum suggested time 6 hours - and the icecream ended up like a semi-thick milkshake - eww! Then I let it stay in the freezer for the recommended 22 hours - actually I left it in there for two days - and when I pulled it out and added my ingredients I had fresh homemade icecream in 20 minutes flat! I couldn't believe it! It was super duper delicious! I made a lowfat version of vanilla only because I didn't have any cream on hand and its expensive. So I just mixed 1 1/2 cups of lowfat milk with 1/3 cup organic cane sugar, and 1 tsp vanilla. Threw that in the machine and 20 minutes later I was trying to decide if I should save half for later or eat it all at once! LOL! Since this amount really made 2 servings I saved the second serving for my dad and put it in a small tupperware container in the freezer because he just has to taste this awesome icecream! Everyone should get this maker - it works! One more note, even though my icecream ended up like a milkshake the first time, I stuck it in tupperware in the freezer over night and had the most amazing chocolate icecream ever the next day! I used their basic chocolate icecream recipe included in the manual - it is off the hook especially if you use organic cane sugar and ghiradelli 60% dark chocolate chips! MMM!!!

But many of the poor reviews complain about the results (mainly that the ice cream isn't firming up), and I wonder if those complaints are a result of the machine or the user.I make gelato in mine, and it comes out appropriately firm after about 30 minutes in the machine (even so, I usually transfer it to a storage container and pop it into the freezer afterward... then it's really firm).  However, I take my time with the gelato, and chill the mixture for several hours (usually overnight) before I put it in the machine.  This ensures that the mix is already very cold BEFORE it goes into the machine.  I wonder if folks are having trouble because their machine's bowl isn't cold enough?  The instructions say that the cold bowl should not slosh when shaken (without the ice cream mix in it!!!), and I had no trouble getting my bowl to freeze 'sloshless'.  In fact, I had to wait for it to thaw a bit so I could dry it out after I'd washed it; it was still so cold after churning that the kitchen towel I was using to dry it froze to the inside! Put the bowl in a freezer storage bag in the coldest part of your freezer (that's where I store mine), and it should be good to go when you're ready for it.My only complaints are that I almost wish that it was larger, as I sometimes would like the increased capacity, but it's already a fairly bulky gizmo as it is; and it would be nice if it was a bit quieter, though I've seen other ice cream machines that are MUCH louder, and you only run it for a half hour or so, anyway.",5.0,"A Great, Inexpensive Ice Cream Machine!",1252800000,"09 13, 2009",Home_and_Kitchen,1.0

I haven't had much experience with other brands, so I can't compare, but for the most part it works very well.The base is sturdy, and the 'well' itself, in which you freeze first and the place in the maker when adding ingredients for your frozen treats seems to be made of solid construction and easy to clean.Wide mouth on top allows for easy additions of nuts, chocolate, or whatever else as you near the end of the process.However, the 'aerator', or the attachment that goes into the well while it turns that is supposed to churn/mix the ingredients and allow for the subtle addition of air into your treat is not as easy to clean or remove ice cream from.  When you are done with making your ice-cream and take the plastic cover off, you must also remove the 'aerator'.  Depending on the density of your treat, it can be somewhat cumbersome to remove, and then you need a spatula to remove any excess goodies stuck on it.

It has been a wonderful kitchen gadget, as long as we keep a few things in mind...1) We store the bowl in the freezer rather than trying to freeze it only when we want ice cream.  This ensures that it is nice andfrozen.2) We haven't tried to make frozen yogurt in it - only ice cream - so I don't know how it works with the yogurt.3) Ice cream recipes that call for something other than cream don't freeze as well and don't last as long after they are made.  When we make ice cream with just milk or with evaporated milk, we have to let the machine run longer and then we have to eat the ice cream within a couple of days.  It will also have a more crystallized and less creamy texture.  Ice cream with a combination of heavy cream and milk is phenomenal, though!  It will still form some ice crystals after several days in the freezer, but it's not bad at all.4) If we chill a metal mixing bowl in the freezer for a few minutes and then mix up the ice cream in it before putting it in the ice cream maker, it starts off colder and freezes better.So far I have not figured out how to make a nice, creamy low-fat ice cream in this maker, which is why I am giving it four stars instead of five.

Even if you have to wait 4 weeks, it is worth the savings! Mine is perfect.The maker itself looks very nice. After freezing the bowl, you simply pour in your ice cream base (generally milk, cream, eggs and vanilla) and turn it on. It is loud, but it IS an ice cream maker...besides, for 15 minutes, can we not just deal? About 5 minutes before finishing, you add your goodies--chocolate chips, candy pieces, etc. I recommend freezing your creation another 1-2 hours afterward because the consistency can be somewhat like ice milk right away. The ice cream is even better 2-3 days letter if left frozen and covered.Ice cream recipe books are a good compliment, but plenty of recipes are also available online at various places. Overall, I give this my highest recommendation. For the price, you can't beat it. The finished product is excellent and easily created.

The machine has a convenient opening on its top so you can add mix ins as your ice cream starts to freeze, or so you can just watch your liquid mix turn from liquid to wonderful ice cream.The only warning I would issue with this machine is that the freezer bowl is pretty big, so if you have a small freezer or one packed with food it may be hard to make space for it.  The bowl MUST be frozen for 18-24 hours before use to get a good freeze for your ice cream, so being able to store this bowl in the freezer is critical to getting good results.",5.0,You'll be addicted to homemade ice cream!,1214179200,"06 23, 2008",Home_and_Kitchen,1.0

The result is ice cream that puts to shame what you can find in these stores. Using high quality ingredients isn't cheap -- but for me ice cream is a special occasion treat that I want to savour with family and friends.Using the Cuisinart has been simple. Two elements are critical: Making sure the bowl is fully frozen -- just keep it in the freezer -- and that the liquid you put in has had time to drop to as low as possible without freezing. I keep the bowl inside a large zip lock bag in our chest freezer - the bag keeps it from absorbing off-flavors. As for cooling the liquid, many need to be heated to absorb sugar or chocolate so it's best to prepare it no later than the night before, or better yet, 24 hours in advance.When the bowl and liquid are properly prepared it takes about 25 minutes to make ice cream. At that point you have two options. For a soft serve texture it can be served right away or soon after it's placed in the freezer; for a hard ice cream, two hours in the freezer is usually sufficient.We find the 1 1/2 quart size to be sufficient for our family of four and the quantity can be enough to serve double that if ice cream is an element to a dessert -- I like serving a smaller scoop of cinnamon ice cream (using just-ground cinnamon sticks) with any sort of baked apple/pie/tarte tat in.  If you are looking to make more than one flavor having a second bowl is handy.The reliability has been excellent so far after 3 years of use. The noise level is perfectly reasonable to me -- far less grating than a blender and the whirr of the motor is also a clue to when it's ready -- it slows a bit as the ice cream reached the end stage of thickening.",5.0,Premium ice cream that blows away store-bought,1341360000,"07 4, 2012",Home_and_Kitchen,1.0

The maker is NOT noisy al all, unless you allow the maker to run too long (trying to make the ice cream very ""frozen"") and it makes great high quality ice cream!  I gave it only 4 stars because I did not like the place in the bottom of the base to ""stuff"" the electric cord; we consumers should demand that all appliance electric cords stow easily when we are not using them.Here are some useful suggestions you might like:1.  When you add vanilla do it at the very end as the ""alcohol flavoring"" acts like antifreeze and alsoadd it in as small amounts as possible!  You can use half the amount suggested and be happy!2.  Get all you ingredients as cold as possible including the storage container you are going to putthe ice cream in when it is finished.  Plan on using your Freezer to make the ice cream HARD.3.  Don't ""over make"" as the ice cream mixture, as it will expand as it chills and can over flow the container.4.  If the freezer bowl does start to overflow, just stop the machine and eat some of it!5.  Plan ahead and make you ice cream a day ahead, especially if you are making enough for morethan 2 folks.6.  Having the second freezer bowl allows you to make enough for 4 folks at a time.7.  Make sure your freezer is almost full, even if you have just frozen water bottles in itas it will maintain a lower temperature better and save you electricity.8. Don't be afraid to ""add"" some store bought ice cream to ""your"" ice cream during the mixing processif you want a ""hint"" of flavor, just make sure it is not too hard to mix in easily.9.  Don't use anything metal to scrape the frozen ice cream out of the freezer bowl or to clean it with.10.  Make sure you grind up any nuts or chocolate chips before adding them to the ice cream makerto insure they don't clump during the mixing/freezing process, causing the machine to ""strain"".11.  Try using both less flavoring and sugar, as the included instructions made the ice cream way too sweet.12.

This year, our health no longer permitted us to go through the cracked ice, ice cream salt and water mixture necessary to freeze our treat in our old ice cream freezer, even though we had turned to an electric instead of manual turning.  I heard of the Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1 1/2 quart Ice Cream Maker that froze our favorite recipe in just 20-25 minutes without ice.  Impossible, I said.  But I ordered it from Amazon anyway, thinking I'd send it back if too much trouble.  I immediately put the clean bucket into the deep freeze over night to solidify the gel within the bucket.  Then I mixed up my favorite recipe passed down through 3 generations.  My recipe was for a gallon and a half, but what the heck.  I poared the mixture into the frozen bucket after turning the motor on, and sat back to watch it prove its ability.  Twenty five minutes later, my family sat down to the best soft ice cream we had eaten for over a year.  The 4 quarts of leftover mixture was poared into a large container, placed in the refrig freezer and stirred every so often.  My hope is to be able to afford the larger ice cream maker so that we will be able to freeze most of my favorite recipe in the makers while having to stir only a small amount in the freezer container.YUM.  We would not have believed it possible to have our favorite dessert without the back breaking process of cracked ice, salt and water--and lugging the old fashioned container up the basement stairs to get the paddles out before they froze solid.

This is the same one as the 4qt. ice cream maker that uses rock salt and ice, just larger. (I know it's the same because the inlaws have the 4qt.  It was on sale at Wal-Mart and even cheaper than Amazon.I then exchanged the above ice cream maker, after issues I will get to, for the Rival Gel.You'll notice, however, I have the ""verified purchase stamp"" on my review of the Cuisinart 1.5 qt automatic ice cream maker. That's because I gave up with Rival after continued problems with my first two ice cream makers and ordered the Cuisinart from Amazon. It's a keeper. However, you may actually prefer one of the other ones I used more if your needs are different from my own so I'll break down my experiences and you can decide:But first...some TROUBLESHOOTING that may help you regardless of the ice cream maker you choose. Is your icecream more of a milkshake than ice cream? I have some chef tips:1.Never put in chunky ingredients from the beginning. They don't allow the butterfat to freeze correctly. They need to be added at the end (chocolate chips, fruit, etc.)Soy milk? No problem.2.Never use imitation vanilla extract. It contains propylene glycol which not only isn't as good as regular vanilla, it prevents milk and cream from freezing well. Use pure vanilla only.3.Your ingredients should be cold prior to adding them to the ice cream maker.4.If you have an electric ice cream maker it needs to be on and spinning prior to putting the ingredients in. If you add the ingredients first and then turn it on, the edges will freeze first to the bowl and your middle won't catch up. (Unfortunately you can't do this on the Rival 4 and 6 qt electric so it always wound up a little runny for me.)5.If you use an electric gel-bowl ice cream maker the bowl should be stored at the back of your freezer where it is coldest. If your freezer is full of other foods, it will actually be colder than if it is empty so an empty freezer may mean you need to freeze your gel-filled ice cream bowl longer.6.Cream has a higher butterfat content than milk so it begins to melt far faster and will take longer to freeze so you will see differences from soy milk, milk, non-fat milk etc.ICE CREAM CAPACITY:Rival Electric (RE) 4 or 6 qts, depending upon which model you choose.Rival Gel (RG) one quartCuisinart Automatic (CA) 1.5 qtsNOISE LEVEL:RE: loud; cannot hold a conversation in the same room it's inRG: loud; cannot hold a convesation in the same room it's inCA: surprisingly quiet...not silent but quite a purr compared to the other two.BUILD:RE: Cheaply made which wound up being our problem. The outside core is a very flimsy plastic. Thinner than my Tupperware. Not only did this not insulate the ice well which resulted in fast melting, it also wore down after a week of the motor popping out of the locked position and it's flexibility allowed pieces of ice to get lodged in the sides and make the motor stop. This is so common that it says in the owner's manual that when it does this you need to stop it and move the ice. This means you always need to be watching it during making. Happens on both size models which is why I had to exchange this originally for the gel model at Wal-mart. That flimsy plastic wore down after just one week from the motor popping off of the lock sockets.RG: Made better than the other model except the top leaves air in too close to ice cream which means it doesn't freeze as well and the fill hole is on an angle rather than top and is very small so ingredients spill easily.CA: I like the make, compact so no warm air is inside, sturdy, stores more easily with cord compartment, heavy-duty with no flimsiness or easily broken parts.CONCEPT:RE: Winds up costing more due to needing to buy rock salt and crushed ice each time. The manual states to use crushed ice only and this is because the top pops off easily and ice can get lodged between spinning bowl and the side. For some crazy reason, the paddle doesn't spin, the bowl does which means it makes the ice migrate and melt easily. Rock salt should not go down your sink so we would also walk it outside to the street. You don't want it in your yard either. Very messy with all the rock salt and ice being poured in while running in comparison to the other two models.RG: Freeze the gel bowl for about 24 hours and use no rock salt or ice.CA: Same as the RG.ISSUES:RE: Had lots of problems with having to fool with it during the process to make it work right, turns off automatically even if the icecream is runny when it senses the edges are done.RG: Motor overheats easily and when it does this it turns off automatically and won't allow you to start it again for another 20 minutes. An ice cream maker isn't needed to mix ingredients but to whip air into it so it doesn't freeze as an ice block but instead becomes fluffy. This means you ruin your mix and have to start over. They need a more powerful motor to avoid this rather than an auto shut off which ruins your batch.CA: Does not turn off automatically and has never overheated. If you need more freezing time, you can just keep on going.  I haven't yet had any problems with my Cuisinart but will report back if one comes up.TIME NEEDED TO WORK:RE: Usually 50 minRG:  Usually 35 to 38 minCA:  Usually 20 to 30 minThe time will vary per ingredients.  I based the above all on my plain vanilla recipe.All models come with a basic recipe book but they are so basic you'll probably want a good ice cream recipe book.  I love the Ben and Jerrys one because it's not just recipes, but goes into the science of making the perfect bowl too.  The Cuisinart has the nutritionals to every recipe, the Rival doesn't.  You probably don't want to see the calories of ice cream anyway. Especially chocolate!WARRANTY:RE 1 yearRG 1 yearCA  3 yearsICE CREAM CONSISTENCY:RE: I was very disappointed in the Rival Electric.  It runs until it senses the outside edges are done but this left my inside ice cream edges not whipped. It says to get it hard you should freeze it for 4 hours but the next day, since air wasn't whipped in, it left it a block of ice and I couldn't even scoop it. Because of this and then the plastic lock in wearing out is why I returned it for the Rival Gel.RG: I got a good batch but it was still softer than I wanted, however the next 2 times the motor got hot and, as per the owners manual, apparently this design flaw is common enough that it turns itself off when this happens and won't start again for another 20 min leaving me with 2 bad batches so I returned it.CA: If you like yours soft, 20 min seems to work well for that but I usually go all the way to 30 min to get the perfect consistency of whipped air into the icecream allowing it to be soft but still easily scooped days later.  Even on high butterfat ice cream recipes we had a perfect consistency so I fell in love with this one. That was the main thing for me, to get a good whipped up ice cream. Not an icy one even days later. This one is advertised as having a ""heavy duty motor"" which may mean the difference in it not overheating.CLEANING: Owners manual of all say to clean parts in warm soapy water, not the dishwasher.CONCLUSION: Although the Rival Electric holds more ice cream which is perfect if you are making it for a big crowd, I have had no negative results with the Cuisinart since I ordered it while the other makers were returned to the store...and I rarely return anything. However, it's also possible I just got unlucky so if you want a large capacity and have easier access than I do to crushed ice, it might be worth a try.For me, the Cusinart 1.5 qt is just the right size to keep the ice cream fresh for us before it's time to make another batch. For a large family, it may not work, but we nibble on it for a week then make another batch and that works great for us and since the consistency and motor where better than the Rival Gel for me this remains my pick.",5.0,First-hand comparison of 3 ice cream maker models,1276473600,"06 14, 2010",Home_and_Kitchen,1.0

To avoid the problems other reviewers have experienced, just follow these tips (some posted by other reviewers too):1) Freeze the bowl with a bag of ice cubes in it (thanks for the tip, Cynthia Nelson). It worked for me, and now I only need to freeze it overnight (instead of 48 hours each time I wanted to use it).2) Use a blender to mix all ingredients! It's easier to pour from the blender jar into the ice-cream machine, and the sugar is properly mixed and melted into the heavy cream.3) For fruit-flavored ice cream, use frozen fruits instead of fresh fruit puree, or you can buy fresh fruits and cut them up and freeze them. Blend away as you would if you were making a smoothie. I did this and compared it to using fresh fruit puree and found that the ""smoothie"" mixture chills and thickens faster in the machine (10 - 15 mins); whilst the fresh fruit puree mixture tends to take about 30 mins or longer and yields more crystals when the mixture is frozen.4) Put a small bag of ice on top of the opening of the transparent lid - use the bag of ice cubes that you put into the bowl in the freezer. It helps with chilling the mixture faster while it is being churned. Mine did not melt nor drip into the mixture.5) Put an empty glass container in the freezer before you start making the ice-cream mixture. Use it to store the ice-cream. I use a Pyrex bowl with its lid as glass chills faster than plastic.I modified a recipe I found online, and get awesome creamy ice cream which doesn't get frozen hard like a rock even when it's been in the freezer for 2 - 3 days! You can, of course cut down on the sugar or use fat-free products or artificial sweeteners (which I haven't tried - I believe natural is better than those chemicals in artificial sweeteners. Our bodies can work off the sugar, but the chemicals stay in our system!)1.5 cups heavy whipping cream1 cup Half & Half or evaporated milk1 - 1.5 cups frozen strawberries or any other frozen fruit1 + 1/4 cup granulated white sugar2 tablespoons lemon juice (optional)Put everything in the blender and blend until the ingredients are well-mixed.

(More on that later.) For the machine to successfully work, the bowl must be placed in the freezer at least fifteen hours in advance, and the mix must be refrigerated for a minimum of 12 hours, preferably at least 24 hours.  Unless you store the bowl in your freezer and use a non-cooked mixture, you won't be able to make ice cream on the spur of the moment.The machine is fairly noisy, much like the earlier electric churners that used salt and ice.  But operation cannot be easier.  Simply insert the paddle, pour in the mix, attach the top, and start it up.  In 20-30 minutes, depending on the butterfat content and beginning temperature of the mix, you have soft serve consistency ice cream, sorbet, frozen yogurt, or sherbet.  To improve the flavor and consistency, the frozen dessert should be ripened in another container for at least 2 hours in the freezer.The biggest drawbacks to the Cuisinart ice cream maker are its relatively small size, especially compared to the KitchenAid attachment, and the way a portion of the ice cream freezes solid to the sides of the bowl, thus creating some waste.  Of course, you can always take a sturdy non-metal utensil to it to sample it right away.  You'll have to let the bowl thaw some before hand-washing.  None of the parts are dishwasher safe, although all are a breeze to clean once the bowl loses its extreme cold.If you own a KitchenAid mixer, you might want to check out the attachment, but you really can't go wrong with the Cuisinart.

After allowing the mixer's gel to return to room temperature, light soap and water is all that is needed.My only complaint is that after 30 minutes the appliance achieves only a ""soft-serve"" consistency rather than a firm dessert.

One cautionary note: When they say &quot;one generous quart,&quot; they mean GENEROUS. Particularly if you plan on adding mix-ins. I followed the chocolate chip cookie dough directions exactly and used a batch of the sweet cream base and a cup and a half of cookie dough -- and then had to shut off the machine fast before it overflowed completely!I should've known something was up with the Ben and Jerry directions when the base ingredients included three cups of liquid, another cup of sugar and eggs, AND a cup and a half of cookie dough -- I mean, even without any air mixing in, that adds up to almost a quart and a half. With air mixing in... I ended up with closer to two quarts of ice cream from a theoretically &quot;one generous quart&quot; recipe from that book.

The first batch came out a bit icy, although okay; I decided that freezing the bowl for 2-3 hours isn't enough, and, perhaps the room was too warm.  ... Next batch, I let the bowl freeze for a full 24 hours in the back of my freezer, and also, when running the machine, I covered the open &quot;hole&quot; in the cover of the machine with a piece of aluminum foil to keep the cold in.  That second batch came out very, very good; in the freezer, it ended up freezing quite hard but smooth &amp; consistent.  So, I tried to find a way to keep it softer.  For my third batch, I had the brilliant idea of first whipping the cream a bit, for a minute or two, before I used it (something not in any instructions) and that REALLY made GREAT ice cream!!!  (I used a portable Salton-type hand mixer, which whipped the cream a little bit, adding some air, but didn't really make it &quot;whipped cream&quot;.)In all other regards, it's important to read and follow all instructions.  Then, with the above suggestion to whip the heavy cream slightly before you combine everything, you'll get ice cream that is simply superb, the perfect texture that exactly matches what you'll get in stores, even though you don't add any stiffeners or carageenan etc.I have not tried other ice cream makers, but I have had such excellent results with this one, that if I were purchasing one, I would just get this and not take chances on lesser brands.",5.0,Suggestions &amp; Helpful Hints,1088553600,"06 30, 2004",Home_and_Kitchen,1.0

We also like how fast it works -- often, the ice cream is fully processed well before the 30 minutes are up -- and how easy it is to clean and use.  The key is that the container where you pour the ingredients is VERY well insulated, and stays ridiculously cold.  In fact, you'll have trouble cleaning it until it's had quite some time to defrost a bit (the ice cream stays frozen and thus stuck to the container).  In fact, it stays so cold, and the ingredients stay so stuck inside it, you should plan on having one good, rigid plastic spatula for getting the ice cream out of it after it's processed.

Lee,"[5, 5]","Although this machine makes good ice cream, the one I purchased (in July of 2009) had a major design flaw.The paddle can easily pop out of the indentation at the bottom of the bowl. The bottom of the bowl has an approximate 1/4 inch indentation that the paddle fits into. It would seem that the lid that covers the machine and fits over the paddle would prevent the paddle from raising more than a 1/4 inch but it does not. After the machine has run for about 5 to 10 minutes, the paddle pops out of the indentation. The bottom of the paddle moves to one side and now it is at an angle in the bowl. It still makes ice cream however it allows ice cream to freeze and build up on the side of the bowl.I am thinking that maybe Cuisinart changed the design of the paddle and did not test it before marketing it. Even though the paddle has two sides to it, only one side scrapes the frozen ice cream off the side of the bowl as the bowl rotates. As the frozen layer builds up on the side of the bowl, it puts pressure on only one side of the paddle which eventually causes it to become dislodged.You may not notice that the paddle has dislodged. When it does, it makes a single popping noise and continues on as normal. But if you look carefully at the paddle, you will notice it is in the bowl at an angle. The first batch of ice cream I made I heard the popping noise but never noticed that the paddle was at an angle. It continued to make a batch of ice cream but I did notice there was a build up on the side of the bowl.Since the paddle remains stationary and the bowl rotates, it seems to me that the lid should not allow the paddle to move up. It needs to have just a small clearance between the top of the paddle and the lid cover.The fix:What I did was placed three spots of hot glue on the inside of the top of the lid. I made the thickness such that it would not rest on the paddle when the lid was on the machine but just about. I had to cut some of the glue out to accomplish this.

I wanted to make my own home frozen yogurt. I had been going to a local shop for years. The price just kept going up and up. It reached a point where it was ridiculous for a small frozen yogurt. So I went to Amazon and started reading reviews on various home ice cream makers. This one had the most favorable reviews. Now I have not made ice cream in it yet but I have had wonderful success in making nonfat and sugar free frozen yogurt. I couldn't be more thrilled! I use store bought nonfat plain yogurt, about a cup, a frozen banana, about a cup of pineapple and stevia for sweetness if it is too tart. I put that all into the blender and blend until smooth and straight into the ice cream maker. It takes about 15 minutes and viola! I have a much healthier, more affordable frozen dessert. Any fruit would work, I am looking forward to summer to start experimenting with peaches and strawberries, the sky is the limit!Before I bought it, the reviews were very clear that my freezer needed to be just around zero degrees, so I got out a freezer thermometer and made sure it was. I froze the canister for 24 hours before use, and keep it in the freezer at all times in a plastic grocery bag. Do be careful with metal instruments, they will scratch the interior of the canister. I found this out after someone else was finishing up the most recent batch left on the counter with a metal spoon.Clean up is fast, it freezes the product quickly, it is quiet, has a small footprint- I love it.One of these days I might splurge and make the real thing with cream!Enjoy",5.0,Excellent Investment,1234656000,"02 15, 2009",Home_and_Kitchen,1.0

But since I received it, I've been making new batches of ice cream on a weekly basis (my boyfriend can be blamed for this weekly assignment).  The only problem I can see with this machine is that the ice cream will not get cold or creamy enough as it's churning during its 25-30 minute duration.  This caused my first batch to be a bit runny and moist (even though I froze the container for 48 hours or as indicated in the manual).Lessoned learned by the next batch.  Instead, I froze the container as I did before as directed in the manual and after making the ice cream mixture I put it in the freezer for about 15-20 minutes.  This added prep-step helps the mixture be at a cooler level and give it the ice cream consistency that you would get from the store-bought version (note - if you have time on your hands, you can chill the mixture in the refrigerator 4 hours to overnight).  Plus, as the motor is running for almost 30 minutes, the machine is heating up and warming up the container---you want the container to be at its coldest as possible and the mixture cold but not frozen to get the right consistency.  The results have been great ever since.",4.0,Good buy for a reasonable price,1215129600,"07 4, 2008",Home_and_Kitchen,1.0

Plus side folks are going on and on that you need a freezer cold enough, and that ingredients should be cold (""prepped a short time in the freezer""), that you should make smaller batches, or you should re-freeze after wards.  All of these to me defeat the easy and ""automatic"" statement/purpose.

And my freezer is set to the coldest setting, and apparently still isn't good enough for this thing.  Now what?  Go to ""11""?

Hansen ""Coffee Monkey's Father""","[3, 3]","This works well, but there are a few points to make it a success.-First, make sure your freezer is cold. A lot of freezers are too warm. -10 to zero F is ideal. Recommended food storage is halved for every 5 degrees above zero F. At -10 you are golden for this unit.-Second, make sure you freeze the bowl for a long time. 24 hours should be enough.-Third, make sure your ingredients are cold. Even if they are cool, it should be ok, but will be softer.Custard based recipes work great. Regarding taste... I'm amazed how many people have become so accustomed to artificial flavors and conditioners, that ""real"" doesn't taste right anymore. I find pure cream based recipes can leave a bit of a film on the roof of the mouth regardless of the tool used, but cutting with 25% half-and-half or whole milk is a good ratio. Nothing beats a good custard based ice cream on a hot day, four or five ingredients: Cream, sugar, eggs, flavorings, home run.Some things I don't like about it:Gel based freezers work, but they warm up from the second you take them out of the freezer. The old style salt and ice can maintain temps well, and the expensive integrated freezer units are about perfect, but obviously cost more. You need know know that going in. Gel isn't magic, but it works. You can't fault it for being something it's not though.The dasher doesn't scrape the side of the bowl, it sits off just slightly. This leaves a ring of frozen icy cream, not a smooth ice cream stuck to the side. I think the newer version has a better dasher/scraper.I might try running it in the freezer on an extension cord... why not.No way I would pay full retail for this, but at the current price point, it's a good deal.Also consider buying a treadmill or running shoes.",4.0,Works well,1340150400,"06 20, 2012",Home_and_Kitchen,1.0

DO make sure the freezer bowl is absolutely dry before freezing. DO place it in the freezer at least 24 hours before use. DO use only plastic or wooden utensils. DO hand wash the bowl (very quick and easy).3) Make viable recipes. You will read of motor failures from some users... they must be straining this unit very very hard with glop. The motor is quite robust (a bit noisy though) and well geared down, so even thick recipes will work (I made a thick chocolate pudding with condensed milk once... very good!) but do not expect that anything you decide to throw in the bowl will somehow magically work.

It's made of excellent quality materials, and is put together very well, which is what you come to expect from a brand name like cuisinart. It's not exactly the most beautiful thing you would want to store on your countertop, but it's an ice cream maker. If you want something more attractive, you'll seriously have to shell out much more cash. In any other case, the cuisinart automatic ice cream maker is functional and easy to use, as well as it is easy to clean up. All it takes is common sense.You begin by making your frozen dessert base. I say this because the make is capable of making several different types of iced treats, which shouldn't be surprising, nor is it exclusive to this machine, but that's a given. I MUST STRESS. If you consider yourself handicapped when it comes to cooking in the kitchen, you will probably have trouble with this ice cream maker. If you cannot make a piece of toast, or a bag of popcorn without causing a smoke alarm to go off, then I would suggest spending more time in the kitchen cooking, and gaining some patience. If you cannot make a simple custard base, or incorporate simple flavorings such  cocoa, strawberries or vanilla, then there's not much sense in buying an ice cream maker to begin with.Secondly, you assemble your maker, which consists of the following.. a motorized base, the freezing canister, the plastic paddle and the protective shield. After less than a minute, you should have an ice cream maker that's ready to go. After that's all set up, hit the switch and it's ready for the delicious ice cream mixture you already prepared earlier. You will notice it begin to freeze up immediately. Compared to a traditional ice cream maker, this is a wonder-model. It will be finished in 15-20 minutes, usually less, depending on the tempurature of your kitchen. As soon as it begins to look like a soft serve, without any glossy or liquid texture, then you can turn off the maker, although it does include a feature in which it will cease to turn after the ice cream is at a certain hardness. In any case, I would recommend checking it to make sure it does not harden to this point, since it will become difficult to remove from the canister. Using a very strong silicone spatula, you can transfer this to a storage device of your choice (preferably not glass, since it holds its tempurature too well and will melt your ice cream unless it is chilled in the freezer beforehand). As long as you follow these steps, you will not break your ice cream maker, even with many, many, many uses.Next, we come to the quality of the actual machine... I will discuss the integrity of the individual part itself in this section. As mentioned before, the maker is made up of a motorized base, a freezing canister, a plastic paddle and a protective shield.First, and foremost, the base. It's sturdy, rather large in comparison with its height and made of strong plastic. You could not break this unless you mistreat it to extremes (ie, running it for more than an hour, running it without an ice cream canister). It is powerful enough to last you throughout your ice cream making purposes, and will last you a very long time, if you use it on a semi-frequent basis (ie, 1-4 times a month). If you were to use this on an everyday basis, I would expect it to last for many years. That is how well it seems to be made. There is minimal engine heating, and no unusual noises you should expect from a rotation motor. It does have a rather high pitched hum, but it's nothing that will bother you, or the dog. Imagine the sound a food processor makes, and tone that down 85%.Secondly, we have the canister itself. Freeze it overnight and set on the base. Seems much more simple than the traditional layering of ice and a very large amount of salt into the maker. And I mean LARGE. With a normal ice cream maker, you will need maybe 16 oz or more of salt. That's about two cups, and while salt comes cheap, most people consider this quite a bit of salt, considering that we rarely need more than half a teaspoon in most of our everyday cooking. The way it is put together is amazing. While the capacity is not that large, it is more than enough for a reasonably small family (will make enough for six 8 oz scoops).  It is very well built, and will not leak so long as you care for it. Each overnight freeze will last you about two batches of ice cream, depending on the atmosphere.Next is the paddle. It's not the most sturdy, but it's the standard of all ice cream makers. As mentioned in another review, they would prefer a metal paddle, which I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND. Ice cream maker paddles are made to SCRAPE THE SIDES OF THE CANISTER. The entire point of it being plastic is so that it doesn't scrape off metal residues from the canister, or in this canister's case, damage the nonstick properties of the smooth surface. Never put the mixture in before turning the machine on. As I said before, the canister works very quickly, and will begin to freeze instantaneously as you pour it in, so it is imperative that you keep the motor running as you transfer your mixture into the machine. If you treat it well, it will last you longer than the motor.Lastly is the protective casing. It's purpose is to serve as a guard from the spinning canister. Yes, that's right. Rather than have the paddle spin, the motor spins the canister while the paddle sits in place. This is not common, since turning the canister actually requires more power than turning a paddle, but this is how this machine runs. It does its job well, and I'm very satisfied with how it runs.All in all, this is the best ice cream maker for the home kitchen I have encountered for such a low cost. If you only mean to use this once in a while for a summertime treat, or whatnot, this is the machine for you.Some tips:*With any fresh fruit, I would suggest cooking it down with sugar, or corn syrup in order to kill most of the bacteria on the fruit, and to minimize ice crystals.*Corn syrups have a property which inhibits the formation of ice crystals, and lends a nicer texture to the ice cream. Consider using a few tablespoons in each batch in addition to sugar for a better creamier ice cream.*Using cornstarch or any other starch will make a custard which will work as a base, but ice cream itself is defined as a frozen dessert made from eggs, cream, sugar and flavorings. Eggs lend a large amount of richness to the ice cream, especially the yolk. Just remember, it's better to be safe than sorry and use the starch rather than the eggs for the young and elderly. Safety comes first.*Remember what icecream is! Keep all your equipment chilled when making icecream, and chill the container you will be storing it in!*Have fun and enjoy your machine!Updated April 16th 2005:I'm dissapointed to say that my icecream canister has busted. I don't know why, but I do know how. I had left the canister unused in a cabinet as I left for college and attempted to use it during my spring break. I doubt that this was the reason, but the fluid at the bottom expanded as it froze in the freezer and caused the plastic to bulge out. It did not crack, it simply gave. It no longer fits on the motorized base, so we're not sure what to do now. Anyways, this does not change my opinion, and I believe fully that this unusual case was unique. If it should happen again, I'll post it here.",5.0,Top notch powerful icecream maker for the home kitchen,1111104000,"03 18, 2005",Home_and_Kitchen,1.0

Initially used it just for frozen drinks and sorbet.  More recently have moved into making ice cream.  I recommend using cream that is NOT ultra-pasteurized.  It seems to really affect both the flavor and the texture.  Another trick is to let the machine churn for 25 minutes and then pour in the chocolate chips, nuts, or what-have-you while the cream is still churning.  If the mixture is too solid to let the additives sink, then holding a spoon just under the lip of the plastic cover will help the additives get dragged inside the mixture.  And just a couple of minutes of mixing is all it takes.  Letting the machine run more than 30 minutes seems to contribute to the whole mess, including the chiller bowl, simple melting.  At this point the ice cream is the consistency of soft-serve.  Another hour or two in the freezer and it becomes hard ice cream.Finally, as others have said, it is important to turn the machine on BEFORE pouring the cream in at the beginning.

Some of these ingredients are anything with alcohol, fresh citrus fruits (orange, lemon, grapefruit, etc) and kiwi - amongst some others.

Chocolate chip, peanut butter chocolate chip (my favorite), banana, and coconut ice cream, and a batch each of strawberry and raspberry sorbet. Everyone of them came out great and my family loved them.Making ice cream is as easy as whipping the eggs & sugar together, adding COLD milk and COLD cream, plus what ever other flavors (vanilla) you want to add.  Then pour it into the mixer, wait 25-30 minutes, place the ice cream in the freezer, wait 6-8 hours for it to harden, then chow down on what is probably the best ice cream you have ever eaten!Like other reviewers, I bought the Ben & Jerry's book.  The book is well worth the $10 price, as it has a lot of great recipies and the history behind their ice cream empire.TIPS FOR GREAT ICE CREAM AND/OR SORBET:1) Make sure all of your ingredients are COLD (most important).  If you are adding mini chocolate chips, freeze them.  Every wet ingredient should be refrigerated before attempting to make ice cream or sorbet.2) You have to put your newly-made ice cream/sorbet in the freezer for 6-8 hours to let it harden.  While the booklet that comes with the ice cream maker states you can eat the ice cream once it is done mixing, that's not really true.  While technically, you could eat it, the ice cream has the consistency of very very soft (almost melting) ice cream.  After you mix it, place it into another container (with a sealing lid) and freeze.  Once the ice cream has a chance to freeze, it will look just like ice cream you buy in the store.  In reality, places that make ice cream do the same thing: ice cream does not go from mixer to mouth without a stop in the freezer first!3) Almost as important as making sure all of your wet ingredients are cold is to not remove the freezer bowl until you are ready to mix the ice cream.  Typically, there is less than a minute between when I remove the bowl from the freezer and pour the mixture into the bowl.4) When you first get your ice cream maker, freeze the bowl for at least 48 hours.  After that, I always wait at least 24 hours in between batches, to let the bowl freeze again.",5.0,Great tasting and easy to use !!,1143504000,"03 28, 2006",Home_and_Kitchen,1.0

I also got ""The Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt Cookbook"" for the recipes. We both really like the frozen yogurt I've made in this machine, and my husband hasn't asked for store-bought ice cream since.I used the tips from other reviewers and have no complaints with how the yogurt turns out, and it's so easy to make. I make sure the bowl is completely cold by leaving it in the freezer a couple days before using. Let the batter chill a bit before putting it in the bowl. It's a soft-serve consistency right out of the machine, which I like, and tastes so good it's difficult not to eat it all right away. After ripening in the freezer a couple hours it's a harder ice cream consistency. After it's completely frozen I set it out on the counter to thaw a little before serving. Some reviewers complained the machine is really loud, but I don't find it bothersome.I opted to get this smaller 1.5 quart size machine over the 2 quart because it cost less, it's not as heavy to lift, doesn't take as much storage space, and I wasn't even sure I would like what I made with it.

I can tell you that after 8 years or so of owning this type of machine I made ice cream 3 times.  It was messy, clean up was a pain and it was noisy.  After my machine was ruined by a leaky roof (divine intervention) I looked around and decided to purchase the cuisinart ice cream machine.  Since owning this maching I have made ice cream atleast once a week.  I have even made ice cream to go with dessert for a dinner for 75 people.  Something I would have never have done with my old machine.The machine is easy to use, easy to clean and in my opinion not very noisy. Some of the reviewers mentioned noise, they must have never heard the noise produced by tradtional ice cream machines that have a motor. It is about the level of a food processor or blender.  perhaps because it is running for 25 minutes it seems louder to some people.As to problems of the machine not freezing properly, I can only say I have not had any problems.  I keep the bowl in my freezer and chill the ice cream and sorbet mixtures well before pouring them into the machine to begin churning.  I highly recommend buying an extra bowl if you need to make more than 1 1/2 quarts at a time. With my ""old fashioned"" ice cream machine (salt and water), they always recommended ripening the ice cream and I continue to do so.  Once churned, I turn my newly made ice cream into a differenct container and pop it into my freezer for 30 to 60 minutes at least before eating.  I have never gotten really firm ice cream out of anything but an industrial machine and I did not expect it with this one although my nieces think it is just fine straight from the bucket.With the Cuisinart icecream maker, making ice cream is fun and very satisfying.  Best of all, I did not break the bank to get good results.  Although I love the end results on some of the pricer ice cream machines, my Dr. Pepper pockets could not come up with the Champagne cost of those $100.00 or more icecream makers. I was ready say to myself, this machine is not bad for the price and I ended up thinking this machine works well and what a great price.My only issue is more with Amazon.  I am unsure were the $90.00 original sticker price came from. At the cuisinart site you can purchase the same machine for $49.95 just like here at Amazon.

After a few batches of ice cream and frozen yoghurt, I am quite satisfied, although at first I thought it was near useless. There are some tricks worth noting that I hope other will find useful:- I find that I typically need about 35 minutes of churning for maximum effect. 20 minutes like the recipes call for is way too short and makes slop, and beyond 45 minutes and things are getting softer ratherthan harder as the gel container is no longer cold enough- chill your ingredients! I've found putting the mixed ingredients in the freezer for 30-60 minutes beforehand helps a lot- don't overfill - fill about 2/3 of the container max. Not only will overfilling prevent proper freezing but the churning process causes air to be mixed in so the contents expand- we don't have air-conditioning and there is a heatwave on - right now I find it impossible to use successfully at night (80+ degrees in house) but no problem in the morning when the house is cooler (70 degrees)With those tips you should be pleased with the results.Best ice cream I've made so far:- 1 Starbucks bottled frapuchino drink, heated in the microwave to very warm but not boiling, with 200g chopped dark chocolate stirred in (I used 85% cacao Lindt)- one the above was cool I stirred in one 450ml container of heavy whipping cream- put in freezer to chill for an hour- churned for 35 minutes- placed in freezerThe texture when frozen is powdery, I think from all the chocolate, but let it soften a few minutes and it is wonderful.",4.0,"Good, once you know the limitations",1248739200,"07 28, 2009",Home_and_Kitchen,1.0

It is still delicious and ready to eat right after mixing. I did have to wait 2 hours for the strawberries to ""macerate"" but I just ran a quick errand til then. I also washed the bowl and put it in the freezer immediately after purchasing so that it would be ready to use whenever I was ready. I will admit that the price you pay for the ingredients will not always come out less expensive than if you bought ice cream on sale but look at all the extra preservatives and gums you get in store bought compared with fresh ingredients you add.

However, in my neck of the woods, sometimes it is difficult to find decent frozen yogurt that is not filled with sweetners and other additives. I make my own yogurt, and thought I would pick up an ice cream maker and give homemade frozen yogurt a shot.After reading the reviews on Amazon and other places, I was wary about getting the Cuisinart. I was attracted to the high end ice cream  makers, but the cost was way too prohibitive for me. So I thought, what the heck, let me try the Cuisinart - it got much better reviews than the Krups.Well, I just tried my first batch. I was a little skeptical that I would get anything more than soft goo that had been described by other reviewers, especially since I made up my own recipe using evaporated milk and my own homemade yogurt.Wow - it worked like a charm! In 25 minutes, I had a nice soft ice cream that I would be willing to eat right there, but I did put it into a plastic container for further hardening. Since there are no preservatives and it is sweetened to my tastes, the frozen yogurt is clear and bright tasting, without any after taste or gummy feeling on the tongue.I am sooo happy that I have bought this appliance. No more store bought frozen yogurt for me!! I just invested in a bunch of different Sonoma Syrups (I used Meyer Lemon for this batch). Mmmmm.My tips:1. I froze the tub in my deep freezer for 48 hours.2. My ingredients were cold when I added them.3. I took the tub from the freezer, turned it on and immediately added the cold ingredients. I did not allow any time for the tub to warm up.4.

For a basic ice cream machine this works wonders.  A few tips: be sure you freeze the canister for at least 8 hours and cool your ingredients in the refrigerator before you start the machine.  Note that it is very important to cool your ice cream mixture for at least an hour (I recommend two if it was hot).  One time I decided my mixture was ""cool enough"" at room temperature and the ice cream didn't freeze properly.  Also, know that when you use an ice cream machine such as this one you will get softer ice cream as the final product.  If you want hard ice cream- freeze the end product over night. Personally, I like the softer ice cream.  Finally, if you want a truly easy to use machine, and can afford it, I would go for one of the machines that you don't have freeze the canister.

So I bought this with the intention of making frozen yogurt with it.  And it works great!!  I use non-fat yogurt, and mush up some fruit (usually strawberries, bananas, or blueberries).  Sometimes I add unsweetened cocoa for that chocolate kick.  The natural sweetness of the fruit negates any need for added sugar (although I confess to adding chocolate or caramel toppings from time to time!)  So now I have a fat-free, sugar-free, healthful freezer full of this stuff, and am always making more!I found that by draining the yogurt beforehand and making a sort of yogurt cheese makes for a creamier result.

I was hesitant to buy an ice cream machine for fear it would end up in the back of a cabinet because it was too much hassle to use or wasn't living up to my expectations. I read a lot of customer reviews and kept several hints in mind when I finally decided to go for it. This machine is great. We've had it for two weeks. So far I've made 5 different flavors of ice cream, coke slushies and even poured in a bottle of starbucks frappacino for a blended coffee!! Everything has come out just fine. I did let my freezer bowl freeze for just over 24 hours and after that I just keep it in my freezer so it is ready whenever I am. I also have made sure that everything is well chilled before putting it in the bowl. I have found that 25-30 minutes is best for some of the flavors. This machine is NOT going to give you hard serve store bought consistancy straight from the machine. It will be soft serve, but if you want something firmer about 2 hours in the freezer after mixing should do it. I usually split the entire recipe into smaller sized containers to set. Not only because it sets faster that way, but then everybody has their own portion and I don't have to listen to &quot;he got more than me&quot; everybody gets their own!! Also, the smaller containers store in the freezer easier than a big tub. I found it to be quiet too - no louder than my dishwasher. Everything washes easily and the clean up is quick.

Yes, it is noisy, and no, it never seems to make enough.  But that's because it tastes so good!  Seriously, though, we have also had the slushy problem once, and I think it was caused by opening the freezer a couple of times before using it-- so it wasn't quite as cold as usual.  Normally, we make our 'mix,' chill it and then let the machine work its magic for about 20 min., and voila, perfect ice cream.  (Because it is noisy, we close the door to the kitchen and wait in the living room until the time is up.)  We use whole milk instead of cream, only 1/4 cup of sugar (1/2 white and 1/2 brown), and it is delicious!  It is a little more slushy than regular ice cream, but I've always preferred soft serve to a hard chunk of ice cream anyway.  As someone has said, you can just freeze it after you make it if you prefer the more frozen consistency.  As a true ice cream addict, I can say I don't feel very guilty about indulging in our homemade ice cream.

After having lived in Italy for a year, I really missed creamy Italian gelato, and so now I have my own way to make it.  And it's also nice because I know exactly what goes into every batch.  After you remove the leftovers to the freezer, it is necessary to let them defrost for a little while before serving them, because the ice cream/yogurt, etc. gets hard (no commercial softeners in there).

I like adding champagne -- it softens the texture but tastes great as well, giving it an added tanginess that helps keep the sorbet from being too sweet.  Clean-up is a breeze as there are only three parts to clean.  The freezer bowl, the plastic piece that sits inside it, and the top.Seriously, I have not bought commercially made ice cream since I got this maker.  I just go to the market, see what looks freshest , and it's sorbet within a few hours.  Ice creams almost as easy and much better than Steve's, Baskin Robbins, etc.  I can't say enough about this little unit that looks like nothing.  It's sure something!

I was really looking forward to making low-carb ice cream, but, no dice. At the end of the 25-30 minutes, still just totally liquid sweetened half-and-half.  I've kept the freezer bowl in the freezer for a week, used the most basic recipes, even with sugar, just in case that was the problem. I've tried about 6 times with different ingredients, chilling it all, adding flavorings and sweeteners only at the end.  A couple of times I ended up with butter because I just couldn't believe that a cuisinart product could fail so utterly and I just kept it turning. What a disappointment!  On the plus side, I've found I can salvage the ingredients in two ways.  First and simplest, just pour it into popsicle molds and freeze those.  Not creamy in texture, but still a nice frozen treat.  The other method I learned at our local children's science museum.  Put the cream mix into a zip-loc bag.  Tak another large zip-loc bag and put in a couple dozen ice cubes, and 1/3 cup of salt--just regular table salt works totally fine.  Put the yummy bag into the bag of ice. Now shake it for about 10 minutes, until it turns into ice cream.  If you wish, you can use a pair of legging-type pants for a convenient shaker.  Turn the pants half-way inside out, so that one leg is inside the other.  Put the double bag into the middle of the leg, grab both ends and shake. You don't have to shake very vigorously. Check to see how it's coming along every 5 minutes or so.  Once it's frozen, open the salt-water bag, take out the ice cream bag and give it a quick rinse to wash away the salt.

The freezer is a variation on the popular &quot;Donvier&quot; type ice cream makers with a cold insert that is previously frozen and a churn paddle that stirs the mixture and shell-freezes it to the sides of the cold container. But instead of hand-cranking the shell-frozen ice cream, the Cuisinart has a well-designed paddle that is angled perfectly to scrape the ice cream off the sides as it freezes. In 20 minutes, you have a frozen treat that is ok for low-carb diets if you follow the recipe.A couple of hints; I froze the container well in advance, and after making the ice cream, I washed, dried and froze it again for its next use. The ice cream custard was cooled to room temp and I used a dairy thermometer to measure the temperature. Chilling the custard would have resulted in an even firmer mass, but I was impatient. In either case, non-sugar ice cream will set up very hard in the freezer, so it's best to consume it on the same day you freeze it, and serve it soon after you make it.This is a very economical alternative to expensive freezers with built-in refrigeration, and works much better than the hand version of the device.",5.0,This works like a charm,1067472000,"10 30, 2003",Home_and_Kitchen,1.0

Today I made mint/chocolate chip ice cream and it was the best I have ever had.2 cups heavy cream1 cup milk3/4 cup sugar1 teaspoon mint oil4 oz chocolate chipsIs that simple enough for you?The machine comes with a book that contains a few recipes, or you can find any number of recipes on the Net. Once you have mastered a basic recipe for ice cream or sorbet (like the one above) you can just make the variations for whatever flavor you choose. (My next will be rum and raisin). You might, however, want to be careful about using raw eggs, and using powdered eggs substitutes is probably a good idea.Have fun.",5.0,Ludicrously easy to make perfect ice cream and sorbet,1055980800,"06 19, 2003",Home_and_Kitchen,1.0

The item arrived well packed, accompanied by a very small instruction manual / recipe booklet combination.To get a feel for the machine, I first froze the freezer bowl for 24 hours at zero degrees or less.  My first attempt was a Quince sorbet from ""The Sweet Life"" cookbook.  I pretty much followed the recipe instructions to the letter.  I poured the chilled quince mixture into the frozen bowl with the machine running.  10 minutes passed.  20 minutes.  30 minutes.  40 minutes.  My ""sorbet"" was just a frozen drink.  Eventually, the freezer bowl defrosted and I had a lukewarm smoothie on my hands.Thinking it was my ability to follow a recipe, I decided to try one of the recipes in the instruction manual.  I tried the ""basic vanilla"".  After about 20 minutes of churning, the ice cream started to firm up.  But it never got past the soupy slush stage.  So I waited some more...another 20 minutes.  The ice cream was thicker but still a soupy mess.  After freezing the concoction for 3 hours, it was fine, but more like frozen milk than ice cream.Next, my wife stepped in and tried one of her recipes.  Chocolate ice cream.  Same results for her.  A soupy half-frozen mess.I have lost faith in this machine.  I still think the best and most reliable way to make ice cream is with one of those old style churns.  I just don't think this thing gets cold enough.  My parents have a different model (anotehr brand) and theirs freezes the ice cream within 15 minutes every time.Your mileage may vary, but I would be wary of this machine.",2.0,Takes longer than expected,1211414400,"05 22, 2008",Home_and_Kitchen,0.0

We had a bowl full of great vanilla ice cream.  It tasted a lot better then the store bought kind.  A little bit of the ice cream in the bowl seemed to melt fast at first.

First, freeze the bowl overnight. Second, chill your ingredients in the freezer for 20 minutes or so to ensure they are thoroughly chilled. Use pure vanilla, not imitation vanilla extract. In doing both of these things, I've found I've been able to create soft serve ice cream, which I then freeze for a couple of hours for a hard serve.

My family just leaves the container in the freezer at all times so we're always ready to make a spur of the moment batch of icecream.The only downside to it, is the icecream doesn't seem to harden as far. Usually we have to continue freezing the icecream for an evening before eating it - otherwise it's the consistancy of a really thick milkshake - which can be a good thing too.That said, it could simply be the vanilla i use or maybe the fact that we're in the middle of a really hot summer.

After reading the directions a few times, I made my first batch of Double Chocolate (see my review for the Williams Sonoma ice cream book) and it was phenomenal. I can recall clearly that the weather was all stormy and brewing on a hot day and I was feeling excited but nervous that it wouldn't come out right. I mean, this was ICE CREAM and it must be pretty complicated! I soon discovered, though, how simple it was and I was jumping up and down in my kitchen watching this machine churn out this chocolaty creaminess inside, screaming to my husband, ""It works!"" (A bit of a Frankenstein ""He's alive!"" moment.)It's very easy to use. Just make sure you freeze the bowl a good 24 - 48 hours beforehand. I put a couple of plastic bags around it before putting it in the freezer (so ice won't form on it) and then, right before using, I give it a good shake to make sure that there's no liquid sloshing inside. Also, only take it out of the freezer the second you're ready to use it -- Don't place it on your counter and then fiddle around with other jobs, getting everything ready, because it might not retain its cold temperature and will thus result in soupy cream. Take it out only when everything else is ready to go.I just used old yogurt containers to place the churned ice cream in afterwards and let it sit for several hours in the freezer before consuming. (A long wait, but worth it!) But I encourage you to lick the paddle, 'cause it's oh-so-yummy and will make you feel like a kid again.Also, don't wash the insert in hot water after you make the ice cream, as that kills its ability to freeze in the future. I just let it sit on my counter until all the liquid inside has thawed (several hours) then I wash it with very lukewarm water and soap, dry it thoroughly, bag it up, and throw it in the freezer so that it's ready for the next time I want to make a new batch.If it sounds complicated, it's not. You just need to plan ahead, but the effort itself is pretty minimal.Incidentally, this got a good review in America's Test Kitchen. They claimed there was a better model out there, but it was exorbitantly expensive and this was just a fraction of the cost.Try it and you'll be delighted at the results!

I (like others) leave the bowl in the back of my freezer, wrapped in plastic.  I only pull it out when I am ready to pour in the chilled ingredients and 25 or so minutes later, there is a wonderful (nice and small!) batch of ice cream.

I most recently made a mexican chile chocolate ice cream (recipe from Rick Bayless--Mexico, One Plate at A Time and I cut the sugar way down) and it turned out great.  I have also made a berry sherbet and plain old vanilla.

I must say that I didn't seem to find the noise level to be all that bad.  It is a machine and it's going to make some noise but my machine is relatively quiet.  After what others were saying, I was expecting something much worse.  It certainly is an improvement from my Rival 4-quart that uses ice and salt--which is very loud!  I would recommend this machine to those who like to make their own and who know that what they're going to get in the end is a soft serve texture.  If you are looking for the harder, scoopable, ready to put on a cone type of texture--you would be better off just buying it in the store.

The learning curve is quick enough to be fun & complex enough to keep you busy for a while.  Freezing dulls the taste buds, so your base - whatever it is - should taste just a little too sweet, a little too strong (this is one of the reasons why melted ice cream is kinda... gross).  This also makes it important to concentrate flavors, which can be a challenge.Here's a recipe template:  SLOWLY reduce 2 cups of wine by half - I use a slow cooker with the lid off - it takes hours, but you don't have to do anything. If you want, infuse the wine with herbs, spices, citrus peel, small frogs, whatever, during this time (it may take more than you think to have the right presence).  Strain if necessary.  Stir in 2/3 - 1 cup sugar, till dissolved.  Add this syrup to 2-3 cups fruit juice or puree.  Add something for a little tartness, if necessary, a couple of teaspoons vodka or other appropriate liquor (or perhaps a couple tablespoons of raw wine), chill the base well & proceed.I second all the advice about having everything cold & working quickly once the cannister comes out of the freezer.  I took & extended a couple of tips in the reviews:  I store the cannister in the freezer with 3 freezer-gel packs inside it, & I cover the top hole of the machine with a freezer-gel pack wrapped in a dish towel while the machine's working.Have fun.",5.0,Ridiculously good stuff,1258934400,"11 23, 2009",Home_and_Kitchen,1.0

Stuckey ""kateling""","[1, 1]","I inherited one of these that was my grandma's and I am already thinking of buying a second bowl since I have been making ice cream so frequently. This is just as easy as running to the store and buying a carton of additive-packed ice cream. Freeze the bowl, mix your ingredients, fire it up, add your mixture, blend-blend-blend, ice cream. The owner's manual comes with many recipes and with sites like Pinterest I have discovered many more. One of my favorites is 1 cup frozen pink lemonade concentrate, 3 cups milk, and 3 tbsp Splenda for a tangy frozen treat.

The worst thing that can happen occurs to those of us who are just a tad too impatient:  the ice cream does not freeze up quite as firmly as you might have liked because you haven't let the freezer bowl stay in the freezer long enough (24 hours should do it).  However, be warned that the ice cream is never going to be as firm as the kind you buy at the store, but then, as many other reviewers have pointed out, after you store it in the freezer for a few hours, it will harden up and start to resemble the stuff you buy.  The machine is stylish and it isn't that noisy, although it is certainly not undetectable, as it sits there in the kitchen, churning out your dessert. It is also entertaining and slightly educational:  my kids love the whole operation, from mixing up the cream base to watching the machine churn to sticking in things at the last minute (like cookie dough.)  One warning:  It is not a good idea to add Skittles to your vanilla ice cream.  Admittedly, most adults wouldn't dream of doing this, but imagine for a moment that you are a seven year old lover of Skittles and want nothing more than to make Skittles ice cream.  The problem?  The candies harden, in a matter of moments, to the consistency of gravel and make the whole ice cream experience a little less wonderful as a result. That, however, reflects on the judgment of the user rather than the machine itself which is, all things considered, a remarkably good buy.",5.0,We love this machine,1045094400,"02 13, 2003",Home_and_Kitchen,1.0

I read that some users had trouble with the ice cream melting way too quickly. or being soupy.  I found the machine to do exactly what I wanted.  However, I do think I understand what may have happened to cause the ice cream to be too soupy.  I think that these machines are meant to bring the ice cream to a very soft stage.  I would call this stage one.  I took the ice cream out of the machine when it was done, and put it in containers in the freezer to really set up and harden. I think that step 2, doing that, will solve the problem for those who were having trouble with the ice cream being too soft or soupy.My main concern, after using this machine successfully, is that the two cuisinart blenders I bought all broke in the same way.  Many others online seem to have this same problem. I called cuisinart many times about this.  But they would not help me. I read online that other people had the same problem with cuisinart customer service.

We keep our stored in the freezer so it is always ready to go2) Go for at least 45 minutes for a more 'ice cream' consistency... you can even go a little longer if needed.

I actually got it over 10 years ago and it sat in my pantry.  Now that my diet has changed to whole and natural foods, I decided to give this a try.  Wow!  What was I thinking not to use this before!!!  It has very simple parts, very easy to wash.  There is a hole in the top where you pour the ingredients in.  The inner chamber has to be frozen in the freezer at least 8 hours prior to making ice cream.  It does take up space so unless you have a lot of room or a second freezer, this is not for you.Here are my hints:Get the chamber really frozen and keep it there til you absolutely need it.Read the directions carefully because the book is very poorly written for their recipes.Use scant measurements because if you use the full amount you will run the risk of it over flowing.I put a clean towel over the top as it was doing it's thing to keep the cold in.  Kitchens are normally a little warm.The consistency will be a melted soft serve.  I transferred the ice cream into a freezer container and froze til next day, then it is a normal scoop-able ice cream.Play around with the ingredients because as listed it is extremely rich and decadent.  Best you have ever tasted.I make a lot of the premixes in the blender and then put the whole thing in the freezer to chill it down before putting in the maker.  It cuts about 10 minutes off the time.  The colder the ingredients the better.Dice any ingredients that you may add at the last minute or they don't get mixed in really well.Remember that you are using natural ingredients so the color is very pale, not like the junk they add to the ice cream you buy in the store. Use good ingredients too, just tastes better.You will have to refreeze the chamber once it has been used.My final thoughts.....I will never buy store bought chemical laden ice cream again!

Reid,"[3, 3]","I thought it was a stupid decision - to pay over $50 for an ice cream maker when I don't even care for ice cream that much.  I mean, ice cream is ok, but I rarely purchase it because I'm not crazy about it and even the ""all natural"" ones seem pretty fake to me (tara gum??? what the heck does that taste like?)  I'm a ""real food"" fan, and I like to know what's in it - even my desserts.  Anyway, I didn't hold out much hope when I got it and read the recipes that came with it - I mean, sugary milk is sugary milk (add chocolate, vanilla, etc to spice it up a bit, but no big deal, right?)  Before I made my first batch, I looked up ice cream recipes on the internet and was surprised at the differences in recipes.  Many of the highest rated ones had eggs as an ingredient.  Now we were getting somewhere - eggs add a lot of flavor if you do it right.  So, I made up my own recipe for my first batch of chocolate ice cream.  Oh! My! Gosh!  I have never, ever, ever, had ice cream that tasted so good.  It was the richest, creamiest ice cream.  My husband actually complained that he could only eat a small bowl because it was so rich.  By rich, I mean a deep chocolately flavor - sweet, but not too sweet.  My next recipe I tried (and made up) was Butter Pecan.  Oh! My! Gosh!  My adult son who says he had never had butter pecan ice cream (not sure if that's true - I'm thinking as a kid he may have tasted some) - took one bite and his eyes widened while he just about drooled all over himself - he said that was the best tasting ice cream he had ever had.  The most recent recipe I made was one of the ones in the little booklet that came with the machine - ""simple chocolate ice cream"" - and it is, in flavor and everything.  My husband loves it - because he can eat more of it (it's not rich at all).  But to me, it tastes more like flavored ice milk - it's just not creamy at all.All of the recipes that I have tried have frozen well - I don't get bricks of ice, and just a few minutes of sitting out before I scoop some out makes it really easy to do.So, I guess it wasn't a stupid decision after all - I will definitely get my money's worth out of it.  Here are my two modified recipes for the Chocolate and Butter Pecan if you want to try it for yourself:CHOCOLATE ICE CREAM:3/4 cup cocoa powder (baking cocoa), sifted1/2 cup granulated sugar1/3 cup packed dark brown sugarpinch of salt1 cup half and half2 cups heavy whipping cream3 eggs1/2 tablespoon pure vanilla extractAdd sugar (white and brown), cocoa powder, salt, half & half and heavy cream to a pot, heat over medium-low, stirring constantly, until just bubbly.  Reduce heat.  Put 3 eggs* in a bowl, blend with a fork, then slowly add some of the hot cream mixture to the eggs.  Stir, add a little more, stir - all in all, you want to blend in at least half of the cream mixture.  Then pour it all back in the pot, and slowly increase heat until it just starts to bubble.  Remove from heat, add vanilla, stir.  Cool in refrigerator several hours, then follow machine instructions.___________________________BUTTER PECAN ICE CREAM2 tablespoons butter1 cup pecan halvessalt1 cup half & half3/4 cup granulated sugar2 cups heavy whipping cream3 eggs1 tablespoon pure vanilla extractAdd sugar a pinch of salt, half & half and heavy cream to a pot, heat over medium-low, stirring constantly, until just bubbly.

Stir, add a little more, stir - all in all, you want to blend in at least half of the cream mixture.  Then pour it all back in the pot, and slowly increase heat until it just starts to bubble.  Remove from heat, add vanilla, stir.In a small skillet over medium-low heat, melt butter and add pecans.  Salt the pecans and stir constantly for several minutes to ""roast"" the nuts. (You can be doing this at the same time as making the cream mixture.)Keep cream mixture and nuts separate, and cool both in refrigerator several hours, then follow machine instructions (don't add the nuts until the very last few minutes of making the ice cream.)_____________________________*Note about eggs - I use backyard chicken eggs which I think have a lot to do with the flavor.  I'm also not concerned about salmonella from these.  I don't separate the eggs, and if you do it right, there's no need.  But one time I got side-tracked and the cream mixture got too hot after I added the eggs - which caused the whites to harden like a cooked egg.  I just skimmed the hard whites out with a slotted spoon, and briefly blended with a stick blender (like 2 second blasts) to break up any remaining.  Be careful you don't blend too long if you do this or you'll cream it too soon.__________________________Interestingly, I ordered the ice cream maker pictured here, but was shipped this one instead:Cuisinart ICE 21 Frozen Yogurt Ice Sorbet",5.0,I never cared much for ice cream until I stupidly bought this machine,1375833600,"08 7, 2013",Home_and_Kitchen,1.0

It is very quiet (a bit louder than your average microwave) and doesn't take up much counter space.  However, it is definitely not for impulse ice-cream eaters.  You have to pre-freeze the maker's bowl for about 12 hours prior to making ice-cream and all the ingredients you pour into the maker have to be chilled for at least an hour or two, and then it takes about half an hour to an hour for the ice-cream to solidify.The maker comes with a small instruction booklet and some recipes.  The recipes are by no means plentiful but offer an idea how to make good ice-cream.  If you know anything about cooking, it won't be too hard for you to figure out new recipes, but if you don't, you can always buy one of the ice-cream recipe books.The good thing about this maker is that you control exactly what goes into your ice-cream, so it's an alternative if you're on a diet (whether to lose weight or just can't eat walnuts).  If make the ingredients before making dinner and have the bowl pre-frozen, you can let the ice-cream set during your dinner and end up having a nice dessert afterwards.  It's great family fun, from what I hear.The only downside though is that most ice-cream you make in this maker comes out a bit too soft and requires further freezing in the freezer (about 2 hours).  So if you like your ice-cream vey solid, you are probably better off just getting a pint of Ben & Jerry's.",5.0,Great ice-cream maker for beginners and kitchen pros.,1049328000,"04 3, 2003",Home_and_Kitchen,1.0

Pfahnl ""bpfahnl"" suggested putting a ziploc bag of ice cubes in the bowl when you have it in the freezer -- excellent suggestion.I do try making half batches since I live alone and don't need a quart and a half of ice cream at a time.  Because of the price and fat in heavy whipping cream, I use part half and half.  Still good ice cream.  And another colleague at work suggested using 1/4 cup or so of Dream Whip for smoothness.

The key to this maker is the cylinder which has walls filled with anti-freeze.  You put the cylinder into the freezer long enough to freeze it, then just put your favorite ice cream recipe into the turning cylinder and 20 minutes later you have ice cream heaven!  There's even an alarm that goes off a few minutes before the end that signals to you the time to add goodies - nuts, chocolate chips, fruit, or whatever you like.***ONE WORD OF WARNING ABOUT THE OPERATION***: If you do like I did and ignore the instructions you may be delayed in making your first batch:  You HAVE to start the machine (and turning the cylinder with the spatula inside) BEFORE you pour in your ice cream mix - if you DON'T the liquid will freeze in just a few seconds, locking the spatula (and the cylinder) in place, and when you go to start the machine - it won't.It is incredibly easy to clean as well - pretty much just the smooth-walled cylinder and the plastic spatula, then just put the cylinder back into the freezer and it's ready to make your NEXT batch.The texture of the ice cream that comes from this maker even seems smoother and ""ice creamier"" than what I've seen from any other variety of home-use ice cream machines.Great ice cream, easy to use, easy to clean - pretty doggone inexpensive.

Only a minority of potential purchasers have in mind either a sense of culinary flair and/or a desire to eat only in a health-conscious manner. With the CUISINART ICE-20R, one can do both. Before I purchased this Cuisinart, I researched what was available and this model stood out. I did not expect to produce hard ice cream in 20 minutes or less, but I did expect the Cuisinart to mix ingredients in such a way so as to allow me to play King of the Kitchen. Briefly, the Cuisinart ICE-20R makes it easy to make ice cream. It allows you to dispense with the archaic means of using ice and salt. What you should do it to keep the maker in your freezer overnight before use. When you are ready to start, you will need the standard ingredients: milk (I recommend organic low fat), half-and-half (again low fat), sugar, and various combinations of fruity add-ons, all of which I buy organic from a health store. The mixing is quite easy; a button pushing is all that is required. True, the machine makes a buzzing drone, but I knew that coming in. Once the mixing phase ceases after 20 minutes or so, the result will be of soft consistency. I prefer hard ice cream, so I store the mixture in the freezer overnight, and by the next day, I have a fair amount of healthy and tasty hard ice cream. I did not buy the Cuisinart to save money; the cost of store bought is roughly comparable. I bought it because I wished to learn if the work involved in making ice cream was worth its eating. It was and this is why I recommend it to those who are willing to work to indulge their sweet tooth.",4.0,Ice Cream For Those With A Flair For Art & Health,1152576000,"07 11, 2006",Home_and_Kitchen,1.0

Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[15, 15]","When the hot days of summer are looming, nothing can be more refreshing than one or two scoops of your favorite ice cream.  Of course, it's easy to go to the frozen food section of your nearby grocery store to buy ready-made ice cream; but there may be a problem: if you're concerned about your weight and on the Atkin's Diet, most ready-made ice creams have too many carbohydrates that defeat the purpose of the diet.  So the question becomes, can you still enjoy a delicious, cold scoop or two of ice cream and remain on the Atkin's Diet?  Yes, but you need ice cream that is very low on carbohydrates and the best way to have that is by making your own ice cream at home.The Cuisinart ICE-20 1-1/2-Quart Automatic Ice Cream, Frozen Yogurt &amp; Sorbet Maker is probably the best and easiest-to-use home ice cream maker that I have ever used.  You don't have to worry about buying bags of ice and rock salt and you don't have to run it outdoors for being too loud. Instead, you simply put the freezing chamber in your freezer (overnight is best); then (once frozen solid) take it out and place it on top of the mechanism on your kitchen countertop.  Next, put the plastic blades inside the frozen chamber and cover it with the plastic shield that covers the chamber and blades while the chamber is rotated by the mechanism.  Through an opening on top of the plastic shield, you can pour your ingredients directly into the frozen chamber, then turn it on.  For the best results, I recommend that you mix your ingredients first in a blender, then you can simply pour the contents of the blender directly into the frozen chamber.  After about 30 minutes, you will have your own homemade ice cream! The best part is that you can make it any way that you want, so if you want to use a non-sugar sweetener (I recommend Splenda), you can and have a very low-carbohydrate delight that is acceptable for the Atkin's Diet!  Also, you can make just about any flavor of ice cream by using any kind of fresh fruit.  I haven't tried making frozen yogurt of sorbet yet, but the ice cream is fantastic!Along with the ice cream maker itself, you also get 4 small glass desert cups (which you can chill before serving), and an ice cream scoop.  All you need to provide is the blended ingredients and the imagination necessary to create a variety of flavors!  Overall, I rate the Cuisinart ICE-20 1-1/2-Quart Automatic Ice Cream, Frozen Yogurt &amp; Sorbet Maker with 5 out of 5 stars for its ease of use and low noise level.  I highly recommend it to any ice cream aficionado, and especially to anyone on the Atkin's Diet!  And here's a helpful hint: there are a lot of ice cream recipes available on the internet!  (By the way, just because you can make your own low-carbohydrate ice cream doesn't mean you should eat a lot of ice cream in a single day.)",5.0,Make Your Own Low-Carbohydrate Ice Cream With Cuisinart,1058832000,"07 22, 2003",Home_and_Kitchen,1.0

I had never made my own ice cream before and I wanted to make 2010 the summer of ice cream.  The unit arrived early on my front door step.  I immediately read the instructions, put the freezing unit in my freezer to prepare it for my first concoction, then went to the health food store to stock up on organic products.For my first few attempts, I used recipes in the Cuisinart book that comes with the unit.  I started with chocolate -- an egg-free recipe. It turned out wonderful!  Perfect texture and good flavor.  Being a chocolate fan, I experimented with other chocolate variations and discovered that it's very easy to make ice cream with this unit.  I have since made about a dozen different ice creams and sorbets -- each time learning how to do it better the next time.I always chill my 'batter' for at least 2 hours before freezing it in the machine and I've never had a problem with soft ice cream.  I've made ice cream with and without eggs and I must say I haven't made up my mind which I prefer.  The eggs make a richer ice cream, but I prefer a lighter flavor.  I'm also still working out what type of sweetener I prefer.  Most recipes call for sugar (and lots of it).  Usually the recipes are too sweet for me so I've been using other sweeteners.  My favorite (so far) is agave nectar.  It is a honey-like syrup that is sweet without imparting a strong flavor (the way honey does).  It works very well with fruit sorbets.For the price, this ice cream maker brings a lot of fun into the home.  I have learned to make small batches of ice cream -- about half the capacity of the unit -- so I can experiment with many flavors and not be 'stuck' with too much of any one flavor.

First, use it in a relatively cool room (76-77 degrees works well enough, but much hotter and it would not freeze as well). Second, use cold ingredients. Third, it helps to put something frozen over the opening in the top. Otherwise, warm air is whipped into the ice-cream.

So, to stop him from sneaking and getting regular ice cream and killing us all with his horrendous gas, I thought I should get this and we can use almond milk to make ice cream and some fruit or chocolate, you know for whatever he has a taste.  But, it's also great for making regular ice-cream and sorbets = ooooooh delicious I just love this thing so much.  It's been great for my little boy too.  He's 15 months old and I don't want him eating regular ice cream or icies from the store so we make them here at home and it only takes 25 minutes less time for sorbets or frozen yogurts.  It's become quite the popular piece in my house.  Little note: if your using an alternative to heavy cream you'll need to make sure its chilled because the cream it what helps the mixture thicken so for my husbands dishes I use an egg replacer mix.  It's dairy, gluten, and protein free and only 15 calories.  But, for everything else you can follow the little recipes they give you or mix them up for your own creation.

It came with an extra bowl - a real bonus.  I didn't have huge hopes for it, but it has been a blast.I've read all the reviews here and I see that the majority of the lower ratings include complaints of runny product or the bowls not freezing.This is science, people.If your freezer is not cold enough, you can leave the bowl in there for two years and it will not freeze the coolant in the bowl.  So, do what we did: get a thermometer which registers below zero.  The kind you have outside on your patio will usually do (that is what we used).  Water freezes at 32 degrees, the liquid in the mixing bowls does NOT.  Adjust your freezer to zero degrees (this is suggested for most freezers anyway).  It may take 24 hours for your freezer to cool after you adjust the controls.Anyway, if you do this, and if you follow the recipes and the instructions, you cannot go wrong.  This is not a real beefy machine, so do not add your chunks o' goodies until the last few minutes, and make sure the chunks are small (max size = mini choc chip)!  Otherwise your machine works too hard and also doesn't circulate the mix properly and that makes the outside edge freeze.  It states this in my instruction book.I say get this and let the kiddos help and let them watch through the clear plastic top (ours was SO excited and yelling to all about homemade ice cream).  You can experiment with flavors and fat levels in your ingredients.  And you can have firmer ice cream if you want by letting it sit in the freezer.For those reviewers who wish for a lid, the instruction manual that came with ours specifically says to NOT store ice cream in the freezing cannister to prevent over-freezing, and I think, damage to the bowl.  But I say it is fun, and get this to enjoy with your family.  It will bring smiles for all!",5.0,Good fun and good ice cream!,1055635200,"06 15, 2003",Home_and_Kitchen,1.0

My favorites come from the Ben & Jerry cook book. There are a lot of benefits from making your own ice cream. it's cheaper. It's rewarding. It's healthier too. Even if you make the most decadent ice creams, you're still using all natural ingredients with no preservatives.There are some tricks to this machine that greatly help performance.#1 Make sure the bowl is frozen. Leave it overnight. Shake it and if anything sloshes, it's not ready.#2 Chill all ingredients. Even if the ingredients just came from the fridge, put the batter back in. I test my batter to make sure it's 35-38 degrees before starting. This will make the freezing process more gradual, which means the ice crystals will be smaller. Small crystals mean a smoother texture.#3 I let the machine work until there's little or no movement in the ice cream. This depends on how much you've got in the machine, but my recipes make the ice cream expand up above the lip of the container. When ice cream forms over the paddle and doesn't get folded back in, that's when I turn it off.#4 Let it firm up in the freezer for 4-6 hours. IT WILL BE SOFT, maybe even runny, out of the machine. I try to avoid runny, so next time either let the machine run longer or your kitchen may be too warm. Why is runny bad?  Runny is liquid and you want to try and keep air in the ice cream, so the firmer it is going in, the better. Get it in the freezer fast. Also resist the urge to pack the ice cream down, with either a utensil or by dropping it on the counter. A smooth surface may look nice, but you want to keep air in the ice cream. The air is what makes it easy to scoop and gives it a good texture.#5 Put the bowl in a plastic bag while in freezer. This keep the frost out and improves taste. Make sure it's completely dry before going back in the freezer.#6 I'd also recommend going all out and using rich cream batters. These have the least water and will have the best texture. I'd prefer one scoop of really good ice cream to 4 of a crappy sorbet.#7 Add solid stuff near the end. Wait until the last 1/2 of freezing to add your berries, chips, etc. This will help to evenly distribute stuff throughout the mixture. I like to make strawberry, so I mash my berries, drizzle in the juice, then put the mush in during the last 1/2 of the cycle.#8 Store ice cream in an air tight container with plastic wrap pushed down to the surface. I use 1.5 quart Rubbermade  containers. They fit perfectly and allow the least amount of freezer air to touch the ice cream. Fat easily obsorbs oders and can make your ice cream taste funky. You could just keep it in the bowl, but I wouldn't do that unless you plan to eat it all later that day. Plus, the sooner you get the bowl clean and back in the freezer, the sooner you can make more ice cream!I've used a GE model that had two speeds. The slower speed seemed to freeze better. I also know of some machines that have a reverse function. I would be interested in checking these out if this one ever dies.Mine came with an extra bowl, which is nice to have one always frozen.In all, a great purchase and a pretty good price.

Ok for those reviews i seen with turns out great ice cream in 15-20 min. I don't know what magic they were using but if your expecting that you will most likely be very much disappointed. This unit will produce VERY good ice cream (better than most you can buy in the store)  but you have to do everything exactly right or your experience will be horrible. The first couple batches of ice cream i made were not good at all. One was more like icecube cream :). Ok first of all is your base. If you want your ice cream to be ""creamy"" use a very creamy base. Milk won't work. When you see recipes for ""milk"" use whole milk or you will end up with ice. Don't use skim or 2%. I use a mixture of whipping cream, whole milk, and eggs and it turns out wondefully. So i bet you really want to know what these ""rules"" you are have to follow. Well here goes1) Everything and i mean EVERYTHING must be ice cold. Freeze the bowl in the coldest part of your freezer for at least 48 hours. I have a deep freeze that i use. Are you going to use candy? Freeze the candy. Do you have a base that you cooked? Refrigerate it for 3-5 hours till its really cold. I even put the plastic thing that goes in the bowl in the freezer before i use it. If everything is not rock cold you won't get good ice cream. The faster ice cream freezes the better because you get a finer ice crystal.2) Like i said above use a heavy base. Use real cream. The richer the better.3) put candy or other things like that in at the last two minutes of mixing or everything will go to the bottom and you it won't be distrubutedt throughout the mixture4) Give the ice cream a full 30 minutes in this unit. Don't pull it early. It will be a soft serve consistency.If you follow these simple rules you will have ice cream that will beat any of that junk in the store. Most of it is mostly air. Have you ever seen whatit turns into after it melts? Its definitly not cream.WHere i have learned the most is through trial and error....and i actually learned quite a bit off of alton brown on the food network. If your wanting a good book to get your started. Ben & Jerry's book is excellent. While it doesn't stress some of these principles enough it does give you some pretty good dang recipes to get you started. I have already spelled out the principles here anyways so use them along with some recipes from ben & jerry's and you won't be disappointed.So for $50 you can turn out some pretty awesome ice cream.

I put the bowl in the freezer for a day and I could still hear the liquid swishing around - I was anxious to try it anyway and ended up with... liquid... ok... i was going away so I put the bowl back in the freezer and left it for the 4 days that I was gone - still not solid... hmm  getting a bit frustrated now...  looked at the temperature dial for my freezer and saw that it was set a bit too low (meaning a higher freezer temp) so I adjusted the dial one notch and waited about 24 hours.YAY!!! a frozen bowl - the problem was my temp setting.  Once I fixed that all was well.  The bowl freezes up perfectly in less than a day now.  I have used the simple vanilla recipe twice - once with oreos and once with 'green & black' organic baking chocolate chopped up - yummy and perfect - came out like soft serve but was the perfect texture after an hour or so in the freezer.  I've made the peach frozen yogurt, easy and good.  A few days ago I made the gourmet vanilla - added finely chopped oreos and it basically turned into chocolate cookies and cream ice cream - decadent!

The key is the bowl, which is also the only negative of this machine.  I had puchased this freezer and immediately washed and froze my bowl.  As per their instructions, if you can not hear/feel the liquid inside, it is ready to go.  I'm not sure of the freezing point of the bowl, but after 6 hours in my SubZero freezer, it was frozen.  My first batch was no more than soup and before a half hour was up I noticed my batch getting thinner.  I promptly froze that batch and returned the bowl to the freezer.  After a 48 hour freeze I was ready to go again.  this time my ice cream was still getting thicker after a half hour, it was thicker than soft serve.  The key was not just freezing the liquid in the bowl, but also lowering its temperature too.  After that second batch, the liquid was still frozen in the bowl.  In order for this machine to be effective, an absolutely cold freezer is needed, and a second bowl is pretty much required too.  Freezing that liquid is not enough.  If your ice cream is soupy with cold ingredients I suggest checking the temp of your freezer.  The second bowl is mandatory if you plan on making more than one batch a day, or multiple batches of frozen drinks in one day which is why I can't give it 5 stars.

I was nervous the first time I used it, having read some of the reviews which said the ice cream didn't freeze up well. Mine turned out great. To the guy who complained that it froze rock hard around the side and was mushy in the middle, maybe you didn't turn the machine on before you added the mix- that would cause that sort of problem. I also didn't have any problem scraping the harder ice cream off of the sides of the bowl. I just used one of those silicone spatulas which are curved kind-of spoon-like.

As soon as it arrived, I cleaned the bucket and put it in the freezer, and checked the parts.  Sure, it's a bit plasticky, but that's okay with me.  Then found a recipe for sorbet, made the base and put it in the fridge.  Two hours before churning, I put the base in the freezer.After reading so many complaints about the noise, I expected something  between a vacuum cleaner and an airplane. That's why I was very pleasantly surprised at how quiet the unit is.  I talked to my son on my cell phone right next to it while it was running, and I had no problem hearing him.  Sure, it makes some noise, but nothing like a blender and quieter than our kitchen fan on medium.After 20 minutes, I checked and the mixture was thickening, so I gave it another 20 minutes.  When I was finished, my mixture had the texture of a thick milkshake, so I popped it in the freezer and it hardened right up.  After 20 minutes, the bucket was still very cold even though it was over 80 in the house.So far, so good.

Dui,"[0, 0]","There is little better in life than watching homemade ice cream churn.I have made two batches of ice cream, with the second batch being perfect.  I eat a lot of ice cream and I know what good ice cream tastes like.An important consideration when I did my research was the cost savings of making my own ice cream vs buying store bought ice cream.  It costed me a total of $6.25 to make 3 quarts of delicious Strawberry ice cream.  Dreyers at my local grocery store usually charges $4 for 1.5 quarts of ice cream.  $3.12 vs $4.  This cuisinart is saving me money on ice cream.  I am not factoring the fixed cost of buying this machine, this is just the marginal cost.  You make enough enough ice cream, the only prices that really matter are the $3.12 vs $4.00.Another one of my concerns was whether I should have bought the Kitchenaid Mixer Ice cream attachment instead of this Cuisinart Ice cream machine.  The Kitchenaid attachment is about twice the price and works on the same principle with the frozen gel insert bowl.  The Cuisinart may be another machine that takes up counter space, but if you have storage space for the Kitchenaid attachment, then you have space for this machine.  In my opinion, the counter space argument is a wash.  There are some claims that bowl spinning Cuisinart is better than the Kitchenaid paddle spinning, something about ice crystals.  I can't verify this claim.A couple of important tips on making the perfect ice cream.  Chill the bowl ice cold and on a flat surface, so it spins more uniformly.  Add the vanilla extract/food coloring, or anything with glycol and alcohol near the end of the spin cycle.  About 15 to 20 minutes into the process.  My first batch, I added a peppermint extract, and I visually saw the consistency of the ice cream change into something mushier.  Alcohol and glycol whatever takes more to freeze.This last tip is just a personal preference.  I don't really like using heavy cream for my ice cream, because it is too creamy and fatty.  Substitute the heavy cream for half and half.  It tastes better in my opinion.  Also, half and half is cheaper and more readily available at the grocery store.",5.0,Thorough Research,1334707200,"04 18, 2012",Home_and_Kitchen,1.0

It's no longer all white, base is deep gold and tan. I use it nearly every year and mostly make sorbet. It is awesome. Yes, a bit noisy. In the summer, I wrap the bowl and paddle in plastic (grocery bags) and put it in the freezer. Then I make the syrup (2 1/8 C sugar to 1-1/3 cups boiling water) and chill it. When fruit is ready, chill, then cut into pieces and puree 6 cups of fresh fruit - (my favorite is plum, to which I add 2 tablespoons ginger juice - squeezed from a fresh root). Combine the cold fruit and cold syrup and add half the mixture to the moving bowl. Mix the remaining half the next day or so (after you refreeze the bowl). The temperatures are very important so be sure the sorbet mixture is cold and the bowl is totally frozen.In general, for mango, strawberry, pineapple or most fruit, use 1 cup of syrup to 2 cups of pureed fruit. DON'T skimp on the sugar, even 1/4 cup less will affect the sorbet and it will not hold together. These proportions make it creamy, and pass the raw egg test ~ the egg should float at the top of the sorbet mixture, about a quarter size of the egg should be visible.

I've made sorbet, slush drinks and of course ice cream in it.  The waiting time for the bowl to refreeze is irritating at times, but buying an extra freezer bowl (or 2!) solves that problem easily.  After 3 years of intense use the plastic paddle is still perfect (even after putting it in the dishwasher every time), the freezer bowl looks brand new, and the motor is chugging along happily.  I've cracked the dome lid in a few places but that hasn't impaired it's performance (the dome lid holds the paddle stable so that the ice cream is churned while the freezer bowl is turned by the motor) because of the wavy design at the bottom of the lid where it meets the motor base -you'd have to really destroy the lid for it not to work anymore.  If it died tomorrow I'd buy exactly the same machine, I've definitely got my money's worth.  The only thing I wish is that the freezer bowl was larger capacity because many of the old ice cream recipes I have need to be adjusted to fit.

Many of Ben &amp; Jerry's ice cream recipes are available free on the net -they're the best I've ever tried!  2.  Feel free to add almost anything to your ice cream -the motor can handle nuts, chocolate chunks and frozen fruit. 3.  Always dry the freezer bowl thoroughly before freezing to avoid ice buildup on the bowl -complete air drying is best. 4.  Let it run as long as necessary for the ice cream to reach the proper thick rippling consistency.  5.

Why then did I give it five stars? Because I figured out what I was doing wrong, and I fixed it. I could have written a review that described the results as ""just makes milk shakes"" or ""all I got was soup"" because that's what my first batch was. I left the canister in my freezer for 24 hours and thought that it MUST be frozen enough, but no, obviously it wasn't. It seems to me that there is a ""break in"" period on the canister, although I can't prove that. Here is the main reason that I was having an issue - how cold my freezer was. I turned it all the way down, it helped but there was another issue, I checked under the fridge and discovered that the coils had most likely never been cleaned since the fridge was installed, in the apartment I moved into. I went down to the local sewing machine/vacuum supply house and got an attachment that fits under there. I cleaned them thoroughly and the temperature went down so that the next batch of ice cream was much much better - it was actual ice cream :0)  So, after reading a lot of these reviews I gathered more information which helped. For example, the end result of the ice cream works far better if you whip the cream to a semi thick consistency, in an ice cold metal electric mixer bowl, then add the beaten egg yolks and sugar with the icy milk ensuring it is chilled before you put it in the canister to make ice cream. Be careful with the type of vanilla you add, if you add artificial, it contains an ingredient that impedes freezing. Our second batch was rum raisin which contains actual rum. Alcohol will also impede the freezing process, so it wasn't quite as firm as we would have liked, however it was an improvement upon the first batch. It firmed up fine in the freezer however.Now we come to the ""cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me"" as it were. We just made a batch of ""Cherry Garcia"" from the Ben and Jerrys book. WOW! Came out just like all the rest of the positive reviews that you see here.So to sum up, don't go by the reviews you see written by people that tried it once and gave up because they refused to accept that THEY were doing something wrong. Really read what people are telling you on here. Don't assume that just because your food in your freezer is frozen then it is cold enough. I put those cold gel packs that you use in coolers in the freezer at the same time as the canister and they froze in a much shorter time. I put the frozen gel pack on top of the plastic cannister (on top of the feed chute) and drape a tea towel over it to further help the freezing process. There are all SORTS of little tricks and tips that are located in the reviews here. Don't be afraid to experiment and improvise.So now I'm really hooked on this method of making ice cream. It gave me an excuse to purchase a chest freezer so I can put my 2nd container that is coming. I've been meaning to get one for years so I can buy the specials at the grocery store in bulk.This is the best ice cream you'll ever taste as long as you don't skimp on the quality of the ingredients.

Twenty-five years later, I donated the Waring machine because I no longer had the patience to bother with all that sloppy ice cube & salty mess! (Machine still worked; donated it to my church). I did tons of online research and hands down, THIS machine got top ratings no matter what site I visited. Some places offer a 2nd bowl for an additional price but I knew I wouldn't need that much ice cream. VERY QUIET and made the 2nd batch of peach ice cream in record time; set timer for 30 minutes, it was done in 18 minutes! Easy to clean, very small to store; bowl is kept permanently in deep freeze at 0 degrees.NOTE: The miniscule Cuisinart recipe book that comes with this states that the bowl will be frozen within 6-12 hours. Don't believe it, we did and almost returned the machine! I checked the canister after 10 hours and it didn't slosh one bit, but after one hour of processing the cream mixture, it was no more frozen than the Equator! Saved the cream mixture to try the next day; froze it for 24 hours, and as I said above, it made a batch in 18 minutes, flat.I've also noticed that although it says ""generous 1.5 quart size"" my recipe for 1 quart of ice cream came so close to the top of the dasher that it actually flowed over a bit. So, I'm going to use slightly less than 1 cup measurements for the liquids when I make the next batches to avoid this problem.So far we've made peach, strawberry and banana ice cream. Try using a high quality buttermilk for 1 cup of the liquid; it's low calorie and adds a nice twang to the end result.",5.0,Finally!

After our first try, we fell in love with it instantly and never looked back. To the transfert station went the old ice cream machine that needed salt and ice. We embraced the modern world and the magic of Cuisinart. Because we could not think of a more convenient ice cream maker: it is simple to use, easy to clean and produces perfect results every time. We have tried various recipes, but what we like the most is that we control the ingredients. And the quantities. We never cared for the overly sweetened commercial brands and even the organic ice creams available on the market were too sweet for our taste buds. Also, try and buy an ice cream made with raw milk anywhere in the US... So there you have it. We use organic liquid cream, organic raw milk which we buy at a local farm, xylitol instead of sugar (1/3 cup is plenty enough), and pure organic vanilla extract. On occasion, we add fresh fruit to the ice cream (for some reason, bananas give the most flavor), but really it is simpler to puree fresh fruit and add it to your basic vanilla ice cream (no eggs): pureed strawberries, peaches, etc.The freezer bowl stays in the freezer in permanence, so we can use it whenever we want at a moment's notice. Since the ingredients with which we make the ice cream are already in the fridge, it's not hard to have ice cream whenever your heart desires it.Note 1: Adding 1 to 2 teaspoons (depending on the quantities you use) of guar gum (best described as a natural food thickener) to the ice cream avoids the formation of crystals once the ice cream has been frozen. It provides the smooth texture unique to commercial ice creams.Note 2: our Samsung refrigerator has a superfreezer button. When pushed, it drops the temperature to -16 F temporarily. We use this feature before making the ice cream, then churn the ice cream for approximately 13 to 18 minutes.",5.0,CUISINART ICE CREAM MAKER:  A LOVE STORY,1346025600,"08 27, 2012",Home_and_Kitchen,1.0

So far she's made strawberry and moose tracks; and we've only had it for 3 days. Tomorrow she's planning on making peppermint. All this with her bedtime protein shake! The machine is great. The trick is to start it, pour your liquid in slowly so it doesn't splash. She also puts a piece of aluminum foil on top of the opening to keep the cold in. Our ice cream is done in 20 minutes! Some of the reviews here say it is loud but we don't find it loud at all. Also some of the reviews say that the bowl doesn't freeze well.

To be honest, I didn't have the nostalgia for homemade ice cream that many people have. Every batch of homemade ice cream I'd ever eaten had an unpleasantly graininess to it. But there were so many recipes I wanted to try . . . Still, if I was going to bother to dish out $50 for an ice cream maker and spend more on ingredients than I'd pay for a pre-packaged carton, that ice cream had better be perfectly smooth!A trial run on a borrowed ice cream maker and the fabulous chocolate ice cream that resulted at last convinced me that good texture was possible. So I finally took the leap. Flash forward to the arrival of my cute little red Cuisinart machine, and my first very own batch of homemade ice cream, prepared with a thoroughly chilled custard--an essential, I'd read, for ideal texture, and a technique that had proved its worth in my trial run. I chose a lovely recipe for malted milk chocolate ice cream from Lory Brody'sChocolate American Style, including the optional chopped malted milk balls. The ice cream turned out perfectly, in terms of both flavor and texture: smooth, creamy, and with just enough air to give it a pleasant lightness.

You chill the aluminum cannister in your freezer until it's frozen, dump the ingredients, and start it up.I would like to address some of the negative comments about &quot;freezing power&quot; and the lack thereof.First, all home ice-cream freezers produce a soft ice cream when they are done... this is normal, and if you read the directions in nearly every ice cream recipe, they will suggest another 2-3 hours in the freezer for the ice cream you make to harden properly. Don't expect to be able to eat it immediately.If you don't remember having to wait this long in your youth, keep in mind that White Mountain / brine-based ice cream churns typically have you &quot;pack&quot; the cannister in the brine after churning. This is much faster way to harden ice cream than putting it in a normal electric freezer because the 0 degree brine is in direct contact with the sides of the ice cream cylinder and conducts heat away much more quickly than the 0 degree air in a freezer. So 15 or 20 extra minutes in the brine may do as much good as 2-3 hours in the freezer.Second, if you end up with &quot;cold soup&quot; rather than ice cream as some have complained, you have one of two problems: either you didn't chill the ingredients in the fridge prior to freezing as reccommended in the instructions, or your freezer is set too warm. A good rule of thumb is that if your freezer is set so that premium ice cream you buy at the store (like Ben & Jerry's or Haagen Dazs) is easily scoopable, it's too warm for (a) long-term food storage, and (b) chilling a cannister. Buy a thermometer and make sure that your freezer is at 0 degrees or colder.My only negative comments about the unit are that the ice cream recipes in the book that comes with it are hit-and-miss. The quick / basic vanilla is quite poor- it would be best described as &quot;vanilla extract&quot; flavored ice cream, and because the milk isn't cooked, the texture and taste are more like a frozen whipped cream. The &quot;premium chocolate&quot; is like eating a frozen truffle... we enjoyed it, but it might be too bittersweet for kids. The sherbets are under-flavored, and the frozen yogurt is extremely yogurty and unlike what you buy commercially. Fortunately, you don't have to use their recipe. I highly recommend Alton Brown's &quot;burned peach&quot; ice cream... a quick google should find it at food.com.",4.0,Addressing the freezing power concerns,1090713600,"07 25, 2004",Home_and_Kitchen,1.0

Unfortunately after many trials I found that none of the above happened in this machine.  I tried many recipes from premium to icemilk, from full cream to vegan, and none of them were worth the effort.  In fact, I found that most of the icecream was only barely edible.  I believe that the icecream we made in this machine was the only icecream EVER that actually languished in our fridge (this is saying a lot for a family of icecream fiends).As far as taste is concerned, well that is really not a problem.  After all you can add anything you like to the recipe to make its flavor appeal to your particular taste, but as far as the consistency is concerned, it really was a disaster.  First, there was just no way to achieve a properly frozen product.  The best we could come up with was a very runny soft-serve that could not be scooped.  Secondly, there was an odd thing happening with fat molecules in milk and or cream.  The best I could describe it is that they would coagulate or stick together in small fatty grains that would feel oh so yucky on your tongue.  Worse still, making your own icecream proved to be actually more expensive (not to mention time consuming) than buying it at the supermarket.

Actually, my two young children were really disappointed, because I kept telling them that we were making ice cream, and we kept getting ice cream soup.  It turns out that the instruction manual is wrong - 6 hours is NOT enough time to freeze the freezer bowl.  Neither is 12.  It took 16 hours to freeze enough to make very soft serve ice cream, so I'm going to freeze it for at least 24 next time.The good news is that the ice cream is really good.  I used the recipes in the manual for mint chocolate chip and strawberry, and both worked very well and made delicious ice cream.  The texture was smooth, if very soft, and it didn't stick at all.  I did put the ice cream in the freezer to firm up a bit, as we like firmer ice cream better, but you don't have to.What I like best about this, as a mom with young kids, is the ease and safety of this machine.  You just pour the ingredients in the top and flip a switch.  The kids did it all, and I wasn't worried about mess or injury.

Finally, I ordered the right one!  This ice cream maker really does work.  The only time it will not work is if your freezer is not set to the coldest setting.  I keep the freezer bowls in the freezer at all times, that way they are ready to go.So, set your freezer to the coldest setting two days before you intend to make the ice cream.  I also found the extra freezer bowl to be indispensable.  Instead of waiting for the ice cream mixture to cool, simply use one of the freezer bowls to cool it down and then pour it into the second freezer bowl.  This drastically speeds up the process.I also use the freezer bowl for other items I want to cool down quickly.  I use it to cool down Jello when making a Raspberry Mousse.  I have been known to place the whole contraption right into the freezer.  I guess you are not supposed to, but I am still alive.So, once you have everything all frozen, set the machine up and make sure it is on a nice level surface (in or out of the freezer).  Then, mix up your ice cream recipe.  All you do is pour the liquid into the ice cream maker and with a flick of the switch the paddle starts to turn and in about 20 to 30 minutes you will have the ice cream of your dreams.When washing out the bowl, you will notice that you have to use hot water or you may find the cold water starts to freeze on the inside.  I recommend placing a piece of plastic wrap over the top of the bowl when storing it in the freezer so there is no need to rince the bowl.  I also disobey the instructions and let the ice cream freeze until solid in the ice cream freezer bowl.  I found it just works faster that way.  That way your ice cream is ready in 40 minutes!  Yes, it takes 20-30 minutes and then 10 more minutes in the freezer.  At least that is how it goes in my kitchen.  It is still well worth the wait.  If you start the ice cream before dinner, you won't even notice the time.Here is a favorite recipe for a slushy.  Yes, you can make those too and it works quite well.PINK GRAPEFRUIT SLUSHUse grapefruit juice found in the cooler section of your grocery store or use fresh squeezed and strained juice. If you enjoy sitting outside and want to keep your drinks ice cold, purchase a few ""gel mugs"" which you can keep in the freezer.4 cups pink grapefruit juice1/4 cup orange blossom honey1/8 teaspoon vanilla extract1.

One problem I had at first was that when I used mostly heavy cream, the finished product was too airy and the ice cream broke apart when I tried to scoop it. My bowl was super cold (overnight, lowest freezer setting) and it got to the ""soft serve"" stage fairly quickly. My mistake was that I left it going too long, hoping it would get firmer. It basically whipped the cream. I don't know if you've ever eaten frozen whipped cream, but it's not a treat! This only happens when bowl is close to zero degrees Farenheit, the mixture is very chilled, and the ambient temperature isn't too hot.If you're wondering what I mean by ""too long,"" it's when the ice cream starts to rise above the churning paddle.

The one problem that I have to mention is that a little bit of the ice cream does go to waste because it sticks to the sides of the bowl while it's churning, so you end up with a 1/4 inch layer of rock-hard, wasted ice cream all around the bowl.A heads up for other people that don't consume dairy products:MimicCreme Cream Substitute, Sweetened, 32-Ounce Aseptic Boxes (Pack of 4)cream substitute (also for sale on Amazon) makes the richest, most delicious ice-cream I have ever had!

If this is done after the ice cream begins to thicken a bit, the ice cream will keep the paddle stuck in this position. While in this position, the scraper-blade will be pushed against the inside of the bowl, causing the scraper-blade to do a better job!So, if you can live with the noise and the bothersome shape of the hole in the top, this ice cream maker works quite well (and really doesn't cost a whole lot!)",5.0,Works great (with a small modification),1233878400,"02 6, 2009",Home_and_Kitchen,1.0

All this in record time and without much effort on your part except for that tiresome spoon lifting.Make Ice Cream in the Privacy of Your Own HomeIce cream is not the difficult concoction it may seem. All you need are a few simple ingredients, depending on your taste, an ice cream maker, rock salt, ice ...Uh-uh! Not with this machine! The Cuisinart Ice-20 lets you toss the rock salt out on the slippery sidewalk where it belongs and requires no melting bags of ice to stuff in the freezer in advance.More ""No's"":* No more hand-cranking* No more frozen chunks of ice jamming the rotating freezer cylinder and stopping the machine mid-cycle* No more relegating the ice cream making to the basement, the garage or outside where dripping salt water can run will-nilly out a drain hole that's never in a convenient place* No more trips to the supermarket or to the ice cream shop down the street* No more, ""Sorry, we're out of that."" Make whatever you like!Am I Really a Good Spokesperson for This Ice Cream Maker?You betcha!We are high-end ice cream people. That does not mean we eat only Hagen Daas quality stuff (well ... we actually do), but that we could keep a small ice cream shop in business with just our family. Counting relatives, we could support a chain of such shops.We eat a lot of ice cream and we like a variety of flavors. The Ice-20 allows us to have the best of both worlds -- with a little time for preparation in between, of course.The PackageThe Cuisinart Ice-20 comes boxed with:* a cylindrical plastic churn* one freezer bowl (1-1/2 quart with liquid encased in it for purposes of freezing)* the motor housing* a clear plastic dome lid* a manual/recipe bookThere is also a reply card in the box with which to document your purchase. SEND THAT IN TOOT-SWEET! This little appliance comes with a 3-year manufacturer's warranty on defects. Not a shabby deal in the least.Each piece is wrapped carefully in plastic bags, which I suggest saving, too ... the larger ones, at least. Use these to wrap the freezer bowl while preparing it for use. More on that to come.So Now You've Unpacked It ...What to do with an ice cream maker you just unwrapped? One might like to rip right in to making ice cream, but that can't happen with this particular machine. It does not offer a compressor in order to chill the product as you go ... you have to provide the cold, and that means cleaning out a space in the freezer -- and make it a permanently-cleared space 'cause you'll need it. Trust me.You'll want to wash the freezer bowl, first.- in the sink ONLY -- no dishwasher- no abrasives/no cleansers- warm water and liquid soap with a soft cloth and a good rinse- dry thoroughlyOnce washed, wrap the bowl in plastic. This keeps that ""freezer taste"" from getting into your frozen product-to-be. Use that handy bag that came with the unit, or use a plastic grocery bag to enclose the bowl. Place it in the freezer and close the door. For extra-fast chilling, put a bag of frozen vegetables inside the bowl.My bowl freezes in my refrigerator freezer in 8 hours. It should be a solid freeze. No sloshing, or your ice cream won't ""ice"". I hear tell it can take much longer for some folks' bowls to freeze, but check your freezer setting ... it should be, according to Cuisinart, at 0?, but mine is at 25? and works quickly.Once your bowl is solidly frozen, make your ice cream base. There are a few recipes for ice cream, sorbet and frozen yogurt in the recipe book included with the Ice-20, or use one of your own, but be sure it is for 1-1/2 quarts or less.We make only full-fat, fully-flavored ice creams which I can recommend, but we do not partake of sorbets or frozen yogurt, yet I can't imagine the experience would differ. The methods remain similar, and if you have frozen the bowl you're more than half way there.Come Along with Me ... the Best Is Yet To BeFrom start to finish the Cuisinart Ice-20 is easy to use, easy to clean and a dream machine for those of us who enjoy a good bowl of ice cream often ... on occasion.Once you've frozen your bowl -- which you'll want to leave in the freezer until the last minute, simply follow your chosen recipe, remembering to leave any additives such as chocolate chips or chopped nuts out until the last 5 or 10 minutes of processing. No ""extra"" should be larger than a chocolate chip -- I'm guessing this is to protect the plastic churn.Once you have your concoction ready, retrieve your freezer bowl, place it on the motor housing, place the plastic churn inside the bowl and slip the dome lid over all, making sure to align the embossed dot with the marking on the front of the motor housing to ""lock"" it (not a fool-proof mechanism, as this opens easily with less than a twist). It's really that quick.Plug in the machine and press ""on"". The motor will rotate the freezer bowl and the dome lid will hold the churn in place. Pretty simple!Carefully pour in your ice cream base and leave the room for 20 minutes or so. I dare you to try.You won't be able to do it because you won't believe you're making ice cream right there in your own kitchen. And, you'll want to appoint yourself ""Chief Taste-Tester"", as you won't want any family, friends or acquaintances to suffer at all. How big of you. You're selfless, just as I am!The dome lid offers an opening in the center through which to add ingredients, and I use it to ""sample"". Just be careful you don't lose a spoon in there. That'll cause a few raised eyebrows and strange looks when you go to serve your decadent dessert.If, after 20 or 30 minutes your ice cream isn't as thick as you'd like it (it comes out soft-serve for me), press ""off"", remove the dome lid and clean off the churn with a spatula. Just pop the bowl back in the freezer, covered, for about an hour or less, depending. The ice cream will harden nicely in about this amount of time.This is license to continue tasting at intervals, of course.You may wish to transfer the ice cream to a freezer-safe container for longer term storage, if you expect the ice cream to last that long. That way, you can clean the bowl and return it to the freezer to be ready for another batch.Everyone Will Scream for Ice Cream!Are there any down-sides to this appliance? None that I've found yet. For the ease with which I can use this I can't complain about having to freeze the bowl, nor is it intolerable that soft-serve is my result. I LOVE soft-serve! Plus, the ice cream can be transformed rather quickly into something firmer.The machine doesn't turn off itself, which isn't a negative for me. I can keep it running as little or as long as I like, but 25 minutes has been the longest running time in my experience. After that, we're eating ice cream!As for noise, it's tolerable. I find the Ice-20 to be much quieter than a blender, and only slightly noisier than most dishwashers. I find it comforting to hear it humming along with it's little whirring sound, for that, my friends, is the sound of ice cream in the making.Added BenefitsUsing the Cuisinart Ice-20 affords you some portion control, as you can make smaller batches than 1-1/2 quarts. If you need more than that amount it's simple to prepare batches ahead of schedule and freeze them. It's also possible to order an extra freezer bowl, which I did. It's handy and I've already made use of the extra one several times.This machine offers cord storage underneath it, allowing for only as much cord as needed to reach an outlet. The cord is about 2-1/2 feet long which is plenty for counter top use. When finished, just wind the cord up completely and store the machine for later.Since the Ice-20 is about the size of a 2-1/2 quart slow cooker it isn't difficult to store. Mine lives on a shelf inside my basement door. It would fit inside a cupboard, too, if I had a place there. You could also keep it on the counter top ...And, again, it couldn't be easier to clean. All the components, aside from the freezer bowl, need only a wipe-down with a damp cloth. The freezer bowl in anodized aluminum on the inside and plastic on the outside, so warm water and dish soap do the trick easily.You Made This?

They seem to expect hard ice cream to result as soon as the mixing cycle in completed on the machine. Read the instruction manual, you morons. What you get at the end of the mixing cycle is soft serve ice cream, or ""ice cream soup,"" as one negative reviewer called it. It has to be frozen in order for it to take on the consistency of hard ice cream. Of course it's going to take a long time. That bowl holds a quart of ice cream ""batter."" Do you really think it's going to be frozen through in 30 minutes? It says right in the directions to allow at least 2 hours for ""curing"" time. That refers to the time required for the ice cream to harden in the freezer. Don't start a recipe at 7:30 pm and expect it to be ready for dessert at 9:00.Now, about the appliance itself, it has worked perfectly for me.

Perhaps they were using an alcohol-based flavoring-- that will keep your mixture from freezing!Of course, it comes out of the machine a very soft, soft-serve consistency.

I use it to make non-dairy ice cream with Vances Dari-Free which is a powdered milk substitute made from potatoes. It works absolutely brilliantly and for the first time in a decade I actually had 'ice cream'. With Vances you must pre-make the ice cream mix in a pot and heat it. The mix must be allowed to cool in fridge for a few hours. Then simply place it in the Cuisinart and turn on. In a half hour you end up with a soft serve ice cream that tastes just like the real thing. The device is so easy to use and clean we've been using it every day! This is one of the greatest items I have purchased in a long time and I only regret that I waited so long to get one. Here's my recipe I developed:In a pot add:9 tablespoons of powdered Vances Darifree (or any powdered milk)3 tablespoons of tapioca starch flour6 tablespoons of sugar3 cups of waterTurn heat on medium and whisk constantly to combine the dry mix with water and to prevent sticking to the pot. The mix will begin to thicken after a few minutes.Now add:1/3 cup of any butter, margarine of choice+1 or 2 teaspoons of Vanilla or other extractContinue heating and whisking until the mixture is completely combined and thickened. I do this until it begins a low boil - bubbles and steam begin.Cool in fridge and follow ice cream maker instructions.* If you want to use soy milk, rice milk or other milk simply eliminate the powdered Vances and water and replace with any 3 cups liquid substitute.* If you want to make Carob or Chocolate ice cream add 1/4 cup powdered cocoa or roasted carob to the dry mix.",5.0,Makes perfect ice cream - even non-dairy!,1182470400,"06 22, 2007",Home_and_Kitchen,1.0

The bowl stays so cold and makes the ice cream so fast, I make a double batch. After the first batch is done in less than 15 minutes, I scoop it into paper pint containers. Then I pour the second batch of the cream mixture into the freezer bowl and start it up again. Afterwards, it stays so cold I have to wait until the next day for it to thaw so I can wash it. We keep it in the back of the freezer, and ours is set on a level 4 out of 7, so it's not like we have it unbelievably cold in there. So I'm pretty impressed with the freezer bowl and the amount of ice cream I can get out of just one use, which with one batch is 2.5 pints, and with a double batch five or so pints. Of course, these are all the same flavor, but still. The machine is rather loud, but since I have it on for 30 minutes tops, it's not that bad. Here is a fool-proof, no-cook recipe for one batch:  1.5 cups cream, 1.5 cups whole milk, .75 cup sugar, 1 tsp. real vanilla (omit for fruit recipes). Adding fruit pur&eacute;es will increase the volume of liquid, so you'll need to split it into two batches.Also, when the batch is done it is the consistency of soft-serve... You need to freeze it afterwards to get true hard ice cream. I don't know who these reviewers are that expect hard ice cream straight out of the bowl.

The only product problem I encountered was when I tried to save money (and calories) by using light cream and light milk. The taste was so-so and the texture was awful. If you are serious about getting one of these, use the rich ingredients for the best results but be prepared to spend more than you already do on store-bought ice cream.",3.0,Works Well But More Expensive than Store Bought!,1233360000,"01 31, 2009",Home_and_Kitchen,0.0

It's easier to use than any other ice cream maker I've ever owned.  However, there are a couple of things to remember or you're going to be very frustrated by the experience.  First off, the freezer bowl has to be frozen solid.  Near solid isn't good enough.  I suggest you leave the bowl in your freezer for two days just to make sure it's cold enough.  Be sure your ingredients are very cold, too.  I use condensed and/or evaporated milk in a couple of my recipes and a day or two in the refrigerator is really important.  Room temperature just won't cut it.  And the thicker the better with this machine.  A custard base is an excellent way to start.Next, don't dawdle.  Get your ingredients right into the bowl.  It begins to thaw pretty quickly, especially in hot weather.  And that's when ice cream is best, isn't it?  And finally, twenty-five minutes to half an hour is about as long as the freezer bowl lasts, so if you've gone that long and it's still looking like soft-serve, get it right into a container and toss it in the freezer for a while before serving.I know it sounds complicated, but it's not really.  Most of it is just remembering to get things to the right temperature.  This isn't a big, fancy freezing unit, it's a relatively inexpensive way to make your own ice cream at home.  You're going to have to make some adjustments.  That said, I have to tell you that it's a great deal of fun to watch the ice cream freezing and to turn it out into bowls and see the eyes of your family light up when you say, &quot;The ice cream is ready!&quot;I put this item in the fun to have but not a necessity category.",4.0,Recommended with a reservation or two,997747200,"08 14, 2001",Home_and_Kitchen,1.0

I'd wanted an ice cream maker for years, but could never quite decide what brand to get.  I figured if a product was being used on Food Network, it would at least work like it's supposed to, and given the nice price tag on the Cuisinart, I decided to give it a try.  I don't think I'll ever find the need to buy ice cream again... the product that this maker puts out is AMAZINGLY good!  And it's sooooo easy!So far I've made basic vanilla ice cream with frozen bites of eggless cookie dough mixed in (yum), ice cream made with two packages of butterscotch Jell-O pudding (YUM), and just five minutes ago, peach frozen yogurt (*dies from the yum-osity*).  I have plans to make chocolate frozen yogurt this afternoon and strawberry ice cream and mango sorbet tomorrow, then I'm hauling all my homemade noms to a friend's house for a birthday celebration.  We might pass out from the sheer goodness of all this ice cream, let me tell ya!I did read through several reviews of the machine and took some tips into consideration, so for those who are having problems getting this machine to work properly, I offer this:- When you freeze your bowl, make sure your freezer is turned really low... I always keep mine at the lowest setting, anyway, so it freezes very well.  Also, I put a ziploc bag full of ice in the bowl, thinking it might help.  Don't know if it does, but my freezer bowl starts thickening my ice creams almost immediately and only requires a couple hours in between batches to re-freeze, so maybe it does help.- I mix all my ingredients in the quart Ziploc twist containers in which I plan to store the finished product.  That way I can A) give my ingredients a good shake before pouring into the mixer and B) I also stick the containers either in the back of my fridge for 20-30 minutes or, sometimes, into the freezer for 10 minutes or so.  My fridge is set to super-cold (about 32 degrees or so) most of the time, so chilling the ingredients like that also helps a lot.  My ice creams usually start thickening within 5 minutes and by the end of the 25 minutes are an absolutely perfect soft serve consistency.- If soft serve isn't your thing, just put the ice cream/frozen yogurt in your quart container and freeze it for awhile.  It may sound like a lot of steps to get ice cream, but it's really not that much work and it's WORTH IT.The only things I haven't really experimented with are using ingredients that have to be cooked, then cooled, first or having the machine mix in any add-ins (when I made the cookie dough, I mixed it in by hand because my ice cream maker was too full for me to add anything else to it).  I am sure I will try new recipes as the weeks go on and I am already planning to buy a couple extra freezer bowls so I can make some big batches of ice cream.

Nelson ""Amazon Lover""","[8, 8]","I just bought this ice cream maker (Cuisinart ICE-20) and it was a nice surprise to see the ice cream it produces!  I got the promotional deal that just ended where you get a free $30 1.5 qt. replacment bowl - what a steal!  & Free shipping, how can you go wrong!?This is how the ice cream making process works plain and simple:1.) freeze the freezer bowl for a minimum of 8 hours, the longer you freeze it the better.  I'd say 24 hours would be best.  The more frozen and cold the bowl is the better ice cream you'll get.2.) When the bowl's completely frozen (shake it and it should be silent), start your ice cream mixture preparation.  It usually takes 5 minutes to make the mixture (of course it's going to be liquid - it usually includes sugar, heavy cream, milk, vanilla etc).3.) Take the frozen bowl out of your freezer, put it on the ice cream maker, insert the handle/scraper, turn on the machine, put your mixture in the machine, and put a timer on or make note of the time. 25-30 minutes later your ice cream will be ready.  If you wanted to add nuts, fruit etc, you do that in the last 5 minutes.Pros:Easy to use, easy to clean, no ice/salt required (too messy!), quickly makes ice cream after bowl is frozen, great tasting ice cream, you know you're not eating nasty preservaties etc, easy to make at home when you need it (always keep these staple ingredients on hand though!)Cons:  You really can't be in a rush when you make ice cream, something we early figured out.  The bowl really has to be completely frozen, as eager as you may be, it just won't work if you do it to early AND it'll waste your ingredients.  Also, the ice cream comes out not as hard as your typical ice cream from the store (just freeze the ice cream - more waiting, yes!) for 2 to 3 hours and it'll be just like your typical ice cream (this isn't a con of the machine, it's more a con of store bought ice cream and how they add too many preservatives).  You really need 2 freezer bowls if you're making ice cream often.  Keep one frozen while the other one's in use or being washed.Another con - recently tried the chocolate fudgesicle ice cream recipe they give you - total flop.  Stick to the recipes under ""basic ice cream"" for best results.  Slushies turned out well, but next time I'll add sugar.  I guess those 7-11 slushies have a ton of sugar in them!Also, be prepared to buy an ice cream recipe book, as the manual only includes a dozen or so recipes. If you have egg allergies, make sure you don't try the decadent ice cream recipes - they normally include eggs!So far our ice cream has turned out great - best of all  ""Strawberry"", and we tried Regular coke slushies (you can't use diet/sugar free soda)...that also turned out well.Overall, GREAT buy at a great price!

My reasoning was: at 4 bucks a pint for Haagen-Dazs or Ben and Jerry's this thing will pay for itself in two weeks.  Plus, I would have some control over the ingredients and perhaps be able to turn my ice cream addiction into a diet tool.  The first week I made the most incredible raspberry sorbet.  I also made the mango frozen yogurt, and in the next two weeks made the custard style ice cream and a few variations of vanilla (with chocolate covered pretzels and other goodies).  All recipes came right from the manual.  It is nice to know that my ice cream contains 5 or 6 ingredients and not 15.  No chemicals.  However, you really do need to freeze it a bit after it is made.  And if you let it freeze overnight you have basically a frozen block of ice milk, no more, no less.  So after four weeks it has joined the colony of Cuisinart (and other) products on the counter.It is a nice looking machine, very solid, and I'm glad I didn't buy anything cheaper.

The power to create is a heady experience, though, and the effortlessness with which wonderful concoctions can be made using this machine ensures it will not become one of those useless appliances collecting dust on a shelf somewhere.This is a great purchase even for those who assume they can't eat ice cream!  Since you control the ingredients, you can create recipes working around any sort of diet -- allergy, diabetic, lactose intolerant, vegan, whatever!  The machine also works equally well for sherberts and frozen drinks.  It's extremely easy to use and cleans very easily.Few notes for better results:1) The bowl must be *frozen*. I recommend at least 2 days in the freezer between uses (you may want a second bowl).2) Upon removing the bowl from the freezer, add ingredients and use -- it will start to thaw immediately.  A friend noted that covering the top of the unit while mixing causes it to retain its &quot;cool&quot; longer (a plate over the opening works well).3) The ingredients must be very cold.  If cooking ingredients (such as for fruit or egg enhanced recipes), it's absolutely necessary to chill the resulting mixture before adding it to the unit.4) Choice in ingredients can make or break your ice cream.  While milk can be used, cream results in a much richer, thicker, tastier ice cream.  Also, make sure you've crushed or finely chopped any solid ingredients before adding, as otherwise, they will clog in the mechanism; they should also be added during the last 5 minutes only or will impede freezing (same goes for alcohol).  Thorough mixing of ingredients is important, as well, since the machine does not churn the mixture (sugar especially needs to be well dissolved or will result in uneven flavoring).5) Regardless of what you do, you will produce very soft ice cream.  Pouring the result into a freezer-proof container and freezing for a few hours to one day works very well.I know that sounds like a lot of hassles, but it's really not.The preparation of ingredients can range from moments to hours, as your options are quite limitless.It makes 1.5 quarts of ice cream, which is not a limitation (should you feel you will consistently need more servings, invest in additional bowls).

I gave it two more tries, and STILL get a bunt-plastic smell (though not as strong as the first time).  Anyone else experience this???  The toast burned also!

Here's the caveat--the instruction manual tells you top unplug the toaster when not in use!!  Huh????

I just don't understand how Cuisinart could risk their brand name by producing a toaster like this.  It's overpriced (and I don't say that about Cuisinart usually), it doesn't toast evenly, not very durable, and poorly designed.  The durable issue?  somehow one of the metal thingy-dooeys that lets the bread down and then brings it up came out of the track on ours and it hasn't behaved properly since.  The design issue?  This is not easy to explain, but the switch that you use to turn one set of burners off points in the reverse direction to what you'd expect, and consequently we've made mistakes in whether or not all the heating elements are properly on.  Specifically, the 1/2 slice compartment is on the left, and the 3/4 slice compartment is on the right.  When you want the heating elements for the 3/4 compartment on, you are supposed to have the toggle pointing towards the 1/2 compartment (non-intuitive if you ask me - - it breaks the connection between visual stimulus and expectations).

Young,"[34, 34]","A router's greatest strength, and among its largest liabilities, is its ability to quickly turn waste stock into dust. There are better solutions when the router is table mounted, but your options are limited when you work freehand.The vac adapter mounts on top of the router base with two knurled thumbscrews. Thumb and forefinger are all the tools I need to install or remove the adapter. The symmetrical mounting allows you to install it pointing away from you, or toward you, displacing the clear guard temporarily. Like all vacuum ports in or above the base, dust collection is effective only for face cuts; you'll still need a side cup to collect the chips on edge cuts.The port is a non-standard size, or at least it didn't fit anything I had in the shop. I epoxied a universal adapter to the end so I could connect my shop vac hose.Its location above the base plate means you have to remove the bit before installing or removing the adapter. It would be an unusally short bit that would clear the small space remaining. No matter which way you point the outlet, front or back, I found it difficult to change bits with the adapter installed. Pointed out the back, it set the router on its wobbly, round part of the base. Sticking out the front, it took minor contortions to get at the collet lock. Removing the adapter to simplify bit changing is not an option; it goes on before the bit, and comes off after the bit. The best solution I found was to set the router (a 1613) upside down on a short length of 2x4. This fits nicely on the flat spot between the power cable and the micro-adjuster.The smallish throat further limits the size of bit you can mount, and also your visibility. Even so, it's a minor improvement over leaving the view obscured by chips and dust.One last surprise came while cutting a dovetail slot. First, the vacuum was effective at removing the chips so the bit wouldn't burn. The surprise was the shriek made by air rushing through the small gap left between the adapter throat and the collet. The dovetail bit is rather short, so the plunge was almost at the router's limit, putting the collet right at the top of the adapter. This reduced the throat size to where the air rushing in shrieked loud enough to obscure the shop vac's whine.Overall, the vac adapter does what it was made to do: pull chips from face cuts. It won't help appreciably on edge cuts, and you'd be tempted to remove it if you didn't have to pull the bit first. It's effective enough on face cuts to tempt you into installing it. So, sometimes it's mounted; and other times I don't bother. I wish for a better solution.",3.0,A necessary evil,974332800,"11 16, 2000",Home_and_Kitchen,0.0

With the open ceiling, there is that much more area to heat than some shops, however, not with this heater.  It really puts out.  You can set it from 30 to 80,000 BTU and is variable unlike the similar Master brand, which has just 3 settings.  I looked at several brands, Mr. Heater, Master, and Universal.  I decided on the Universal because vary the temperature setting, good warranty and was the biggest bang for the buck.  There are several types of heaters.  There is kerosene.  I had one like that, but it smelled bad, particularly after starting and shutting it off.  There is the radiant type.  Those are fine as long as you stand in front of them, but the minute you move away, you are cold again.  That's not practical in a shop setting. There is the fan forced type.  These put out a lot of heat, but sound like a jet engine. I don't know about you, but the shop tools make enough noise without adding more.  Then there is the convection type.  These heat the surrounding air.  They are much quieter that the fan forced type.  After speaking to various manufacturers of these products one mentioned that the convection would be best for a shop.  He also suggested that I install a ceiling fan to help circulate the air.  Wow was he right!  It can take my shop from 40 to 68 degrees in 10 minutes with the ceiling fan on and the heater set on high. I went to go get some propane for the heater after it arrived and found out the local rental establishment carried the same one. I asked the owner how he liked them and his reply was &quot;these are great heaters... they get a lot of use and abuse, and nothing goes wrong with them.&quot; I was pleased to hear that!  I have a 7  gallon propane tank and fill it about once a month.  However, the amount of gas one uses will depend on how often you use the heater. During the winter months a cold shop often gets little use.  With this heater however, you have no excuse!",5.0,A Warm Place Like Home,975110400,"11 25, 2000",Home_and_Kitchen,1.0

A bonus is that a .5mm mechanical pencil came in the package too.  It is just the right diameter to fit in all of the holes and slots.The T-bar is a good feature also.  You can loosen the thumb screws to slide the T-bar off of the protractor.  Be careful to not loosen the thumb screw all of the way since they are tightened by two nuts in the T-bar channel which will come off of the threads if the thumb screws are loosened too much.  Once the T-bar is removed you can then remove the nuts from the thumb screws so the thumb screws can be removed from the protractor in order to lay the protractor flat.  To re-attach the T-bar to the protractor insert the threaded shaft on the thumb screws in the large holes on the protractor, thread the nuts on enough to secure them, the slide the nuts into the T-bar channel and tighten down the thumb screw.  There is an indexing  lip on one side of the T-bar that the base of the protractor rests up against to ensure accuracy.The T-bar is 7 in. (178 mm) long by 11/16 in. (17 mm) wide by 7/16 in.

I've had it for a few weeks now and found that it's more than a protractor. You can draw any circle up to 12 3/4"" in 32""nds. One thing you'll need is something for a pivot point when drawing circles. The best thing I found for that was a straight pin from my wife's pin cushion. It fits perfectly in the holes and if you have an extra  0.5 pencil, cut the head off the pin and it will fit in the pencil. Giving you a handy pivot tool with a retractable point. You just can't use a lot of pressure when making your circle. One thing I have found that works quite well when drawing circles on paper is a piece of 1/2"" cork board. Just use a straight pin, to pin the protractor and paper in position.You can search ""Straight pins for sewing"" and ""Cork boards"" right here at Amazon.Also you can use it to find the center of whatever your working on.

While I have not done a project in which I've had to use this protractor since I got it, I did go back and duplicate what I did on the previous project on paper and scrap wood and it is a fine tool.  I was marking angles along the side of a board and the bar for want of a better word along the bottom puts the protractor right where it needs to be to measure the angles and it's really easy to line up the index marks on the protractor with the point I marked on the board.  All the angles and fractions are clearly marked and the slots cut in the protractor make it easy to mark just where I want to with the included 0.5 mm mechanical pencil.  Like the other Incra tools, it's made from thin stainless steel to make for more accurate marking with no parallex error.

I do small projects in my garage using a table saw, radial arm saw and various sanders to make small boxes with multiple sides.  The lids are made of wedges glued together on a backer of the same wood.  In order for sixteen little pieces to fit tightly (eight sided lid) the angles must be exact.  This tool enables me to achieve the accuracy I need.  For those who might wonder, it does come with a pencil that appears to be .05 mm.  Using this instrument I can mark any angle down to .5 degree, using a magnifier I can mark as close as .25 degrees (doubt I can cut that close).  Warning: this protractor is a delicate instrument and needs to be treated as such.  Don't be surprised if you notice smudges when you first begin handling the instrument, this is simply oil from your fingers being transferred to the aluminum.  This bothered me a little so I rubbed it down with a bit of cooking oil and wiped it clean.  I look forward to many years of using this wonderful tool.In that the protractor is only 6&#34; wide it will only extend marks 3&#34; out from center, with care one could probably extend these marks another three or four inches without too much loss in accuracy.

Just take it out of the box, add fuel, and plug it in. It's about as idiot-proof as could be made. On a 32 degree F morning, it heated my shop up to a very comfortable temperature in about 15-20 minutes.While it advertises being able to burn diesel fuel, it's not feasible for use in an area that's even remotely enclosed. Trying to burn diesel even with a couple of windows open in my shop smelled like a couple of diesel engine trucks were idling inside. Not good, but not the fault of the heater. I'd hoped to burn diesel since I already have to keep that around for my tractor. So, plan on burning kerosene (quite a bit more expensive) if you're running it inside of a shop. Kerosene leaves a little bit of odor, but nothing like diesel.This unit doesn't include an on/off switch or a thermostat. To try to maintain a consistent temperature over the day requires that you periodically unplug it and plug it back in.

I did have to take it in for servicing once a couple of years after I bought it but I think the issue was that it got clogged up due to being in my very dusty woodworking shop.  I do a little more preventative maintenance/cleaning now and I've had no issues since.  I purchased this heater with the thermostatic control.  Thermostat is very easy to use and is really a must have item for this kind of heater.  I don't use the heater much any more since I don't do as much woodworking as I once did but it heat up my uninsulated, 2-1/2 car garage reasonably quickly in the dead of Ohio winter and kept it warm enough to work in all day long.  It will run on just about anything (not gasoline) and I used just about every kind of fuel for it at one time or another.  I preferred low-odor kerosene but run it on diesel most of the time because it's easy to get and about the least expensive fuel option.My issues with the heater are the following:* It's very loud:  I wear hearing protection all the time in the shop with this thing for the both tools and the heater.* It puts a lot of condensation in the air:  It's an un-vented heater so you will get quite a bit of condensation with this type of heater.  This can be an issue for both your tools (rust) and your projects (changing moisture content and finishes).* Fuel cap: the cap is difficult to get on and off as the fuel gauge is built into the cap.  The result is that you have to fiddle with the cap to get it past the back end of the heater when taking it out or putting it back on.  It's poorly designed[...]* Filling with fuel: it took me several tries to find the right funnel to use with this heater.  Because the fuel opening is so close to the back of the heater most round funnels sit caddywhompus in the opening and can fall out/over easily.  If you are like me and use this to heat a simple garage shop, you don't want to be slopping diesel/kerosene all over the place if you can avoid it.* Weight: This thing is heavy empty, fill it with fuel and it's a bear to move around.  I built a small rolling cart to set it on and make it easier to move around.  You'll need a sturdy shelf to set it on for storage if you want it off the ground.  One benefit of the weight is that is makes the heater nearly impossible to knock over and therefore safer.If you need something to take on a camp site or sideline that will put out lots of heat this is a very good option.  I would, and do, use mine to this day but I have a natural gas heater for my garage now so I don't need the Reddy heater much anymore.  I would absolutely recommend this over a propane or electric heater because it puts out so much heat so quickly.  I feel like it's a fairly safe heater.  It won't fall over like others, no explosive gas (propane) to worry about and if you get close enough to this thing when it's running to actually burn yourself on it you where probably trying to get burned because the heat coming out of this thing will drive you back long before you come in contact with hot metal.",4.0,Hot and noisy,1296518400,"02 1, 2011",Home_and_Kitchen,1.0

Moving it back and forth from one side to the other is a huge pain, but it results in a sort of less-dramatic Sophie's Choice: do we leave the AC in the bedroom so we can actually sleep, or leave it in the living room/kitchen so that we can actually get things done without dying of heatstroke? So that's why I bought this fan--to help move air in the kitchen/living area and hopefully make both rooms habitable during the heat. I haven't gotten the chance to test it during a major heat wave yet (hopefully I won't NEED to *crosses fingers*) but so far, I could not be more pleased with how well it works.What I love the most about it is the versatility. It is nearly silent on the ""low"" settings, but when you set it on ""high,"" it moves a LOT of air. The fact that you can flip back and forth between intake and exhaust is really one of the selling points--it's super-handy in our combined kitchen/living room because, when my partner is cooking, we can flip it on to draw out a lot of the heat it produces. If we open up all the rooms, it helps a lot with cross-ventilation--way more than the box fan we were using previously. In addition, our old building has huge radiators which produce a TON of heat in the winter, and the exhaust function, when placed in a window near the radiator, helps a lot with keeping it from becoming too hot in here. Bonus! Basically, it does everything I hoped it would do, and a couple of things I didn't even anticipate.I also love the way it's shaped--it fits nicely in the windowframe, and has a cute retro appeal. It's front-heavy, but still quite easy to move. It's also easy to take apart and put back together for cleaning, which is a HUGE plus.My only complaints, all of which are extremely minor:-I wish it were a little flatter, just because now we can't really close the indoor shutters on that window, but that's an unusual situation (most people probably don't have those!) and I won't fault the design for it.-I'm a little concerned about the switch--it seems a bit flimsy and I'm afraid it'll break if I turn it with too much enthusiasm. But, so far, so good!-while it's pretty quiet, it does make a distinctive noise on the exhaust setting. It's a bit annoying, but if you're more than a few feet away, you can't really hear it--I've used it while napping on the couch before and not found it distracting.",5.0,SO worth the money,1298246400,"02 21, 2011",Home_and_Kitchen,1.0

It's very frustrating to me when it's nice and cool outside on a summer evening, but still sticky and stuffy inside from the heat of the day.  I've tried two of the little twin window fans, a larger oscillating fan on a stand, and small round fans in windows, but even all these of those in combination never really seemed to make a big difference in a reasonable amount of time.  I've been in houses with attic-mounted whole-house fans, and it's amazing how quickly they'll exchange the air in a whole house!  That's the effect I was hoping for.In short, this Lasko 2155a has met my expectations.  If I turn it on high exhaust, open a couple windows on the opposite end of the apartment, and close the rest, it does a great job of pulling in fresh (cool!) air.  Of course it's not as fast or as powerful as a real attic whole-house fan, but especially given the price, convenience, and simple installation, it's a pretty good substitute.  It shouldn't even be in the same category as the little twin window fans - those are good for a single room, but they don't hold a candle to this Lasko.  When this is running on high exhaust, and with only a few other windows open, there's a noticeable breeze coming in those windows.  I notice a distinct change in the coolness and ""freshness"" of the inside air after only a few minutes.  It is pretty loud when it's on high, but it's not the obtrusive roar that I've seen described in other reviews.  I wouldn't want to sit right next to it and have a conversation or listen to music, but if you're in the next room, it's really not distractingly loud.  Also, I find it's helpful to leave this on high for a few (10-15?) minutes, and then turning it to low does a fine job of maintaining the fresh air inside.  When it's on low, the noise isn't bad at all - it's quieter than the oscillating stand fan I'd use otherwise.  Not distracting or bothersome, even if you're in the same room.So if you live in a small house or apartment, and you're looking for a reasonably-priced alternative to a full attic fan, I highly recommend this one!",5.0,Great fan!

This is truly a whole-house fan for me!  Completely turns over the entire house air in a matter of seconds. The direction of air flow (intake/exhaust) changes with a simple manual turn-knob.  There is a BIG difference between low/medium/high settings, which enables you to customize air flow to your liking.  Since the knob is manually operated, there are no complex, computerized electronics to malfunction.  While I'm readily technically competent, I HATE it when simple things are un-necessarily complicated, & therefore prone to electro/digital malfunction.  This is a purely simple, incredibly well designed, powerful window fan.Space usage / appearance:  It lies flat, on the back side / up against your window (this design is what allows you to slide the window closed- & locked- behind it).  In the front, the grill (& center control knob) extends out into the room about 7"".  The side panels offer great privacy.  The entire unit is off-white / cream-colored / neutral.

Just like filling a glass with water, once the glass is full you can't get any more water in it. If you open the drain the cold water will come in while the hot water flows out the drain. I have a 3000 sq ft house with an open floor plan. This fan moves the majority of air in about 30 minutes. Depending on the wind, and the size of exit, or Window I open for it. You must open two windows. Put the fan in one and leave the other one unobstructed.",5.0,Positive Pressure Ventilation knowledge help ful,1370131200,"06 2, 2013",Home_and_Kitchen,1.0

We have aluminum frames so I can't install screws as an easy way to brace the fan.  Instead I have to jimmy it a little and say a little prayer.  My hope was to leave it installed during the summer but it's not meant to be wet and it has big gaps for bugs to get in, so that didn't work out.  Unfortunately, it's a pain to get in and out so I think I'll only be installing it during emergencies.How does it work?  It gets the air moving throughout out first floor so on muggy days it is a help but I don't know if it's that much better than just setting up a regular fan.  I'll see if it saves the day when it gets really hot.UPDATE:  I finally figured a way to secure the fan and it really does work on the hot days.  Our house is two stories.

This fan is very good at exhausting inside smoke to the outside.  Also when something starts smoking on the stove and fills the house with smoke, this fan will clear the whole house in less than a minute.  Electric reversing makes three speeds available for either exhausing or bringing fresh air in directly with just the twist of a knob. At medium and high speeds it helps to crack a window on the other side of the house.  Think of it as an 'attic fan' in your window.  Our window are 5' in height and this sits in the bottom 2' and since the window sill is only 8"" off the floor, the fan does not block the view at all except for the dogs.Two things: 1. Closely follow instructions when installing to avoid a noisy fan. Not properly mounted will result in vibration and more noise than necessary. (Also make sure base of fan is firmly sitting on the window sill when mounted...this will almost ensure vibration is minimal) 2. Fan needs to be cleaned at least annually (especially if you smoke).  You can remove 6 screws from inside the house which allows you access to clean the blades and the outside grill.Remember this fan is all plastic construction, fairly sturdy, but be careful not to strip screws by tightening too much.Finally, we've found that we are able to get a lot further into the summer season before we close up the house and turn on the central air because of this fan.",4.0,Essential For Smokers,1360713600,"02 13, 2013",Home_and_Kitchen,1.0
