The quality of the felt is good, and the illustrations are detailed and pretty.  As noted, the figures and scenes are printed on 2 large sheets of flannel and each individual item needs to be cut out.  This process took me 2 hours of tiny cutting.  To me it does not lend itself to a book form but rather laying out the scenes separately or for use on a flannel board.  However, I love the quiet play it offers for my toddler, and as a former Kindergarten teacher, I understand the value of learning rhyme and its connection to future reading.  Overall, delightful product with some work involved.",4.0,Charming characters but busy work required,1377561600,"08 27, 2013",Toys_and_Games,1.0

The production values are rather low and the rules horribly written.  If you take the time to really, really sift through the rules you can enjoy this game.The neat thing is that the game comes in many forms.  You can play it solitaire.  Your goal is to clean up crime in Sanctuary.  Or you can play the basic design for two to five players or an advanced version of the same game.  Finally, you can try a six player version (just so you don't leave anyone out.  I found the advanced game the most satisfying.You goal is to commit thefts so that you gain and secure 300 silver pieces.  Along the way you may luck into 10 or 20 silver pieces here or there.  Of course you will lose money as you get thrown in the dungeon, mugged by other players, have bad luck, or choose to buy weapons, thugs, or magic to assist you.In a neat convention, players move their characters and the guards during their turn.  Two six sided dice and one ten sided die are rolled and the player uses two to move his/her character with the remaining die used to move the guard.  In this way players can choose to move the guards away from them, toward their competiton, or hopefully both.  After moving to the designated area players burgle, mug, or pick pocket their way to wealth and retirement.  Fortune smiles on the players in the liberal mecca of Sanctuary as even the worst of thefts results in only a temporary setback - no death or dismemberment here.Overall this is a decent game, but it will take you awhile to find this out.  Readers of the books will enjoy the game for nostagic reasons.",3.0,"If your willing to fight for it, this game will work.",1117065600,"05 26, 2005",Toys_and_Games,0.0

I bought this for my 6 year old son who wants to do a school talent show. The thrill he got when he threw it in the air and it popped open was awesome! It is indeed made of some sort of paper (kind of like a really thick mylar material), but I have to say after rolling it up and tossing it in the air 30 or more times in one night, it still looks great! Also, while it is paper, I do not think it looks like paper at all when being used. You would really have to hold it to know that it wasn't metal or plastic.I give this product 4 stars because I do believe the product description should state what kind of material it is made of. If you just go by the picture it looks to be plastic. So, I can understand the frustration of others if a more solid wand is what they were looking for. Also, it is not that easy to roll at first but once you break it in a bit, it gets much easier. Even my son was able to roll it after some practice.All in all, if used properly, I don't see why this wouldn't last a good long while. It is surprisingly fun and easy to use.

I am not only reading the book all the way through, I am studying it, page by page,underlining in red what I need to do, and underlining in blue what I should not do, and am learning so much.

I learned through this book that you don't want to mix a blue paint with a bias of yellow, with a red paint that contains a bias of blue.  Now I understand why I was getting dull, muddy colors! Her tip about having a wet sponge to dab your brush on, to get rid of excess water has saved not only my paintings, but many towels, also.

This book was well recommended by a number of sources, so I got it with several other books. I am quite pleased with Colette Pitcher's presentation in this book.The other books tend to skim topics as if they're unimportant, and leap right into twelve-part petals. Colette takes it slow. She explains how transparent watercolors are see-through, while opaque (non-see-through) watercolors tend to have Chinese white in them. And then there are acrylics, which are also opaque, but these dry solidly. They won't re-wet. These kinds of details are important, quite helpful, and other similar books don't seem to cover them.She talks about how old watercolors had issues with fading in light, but that newer ones are much sturdier. That a key to watercolor's luminosity is that light shines through the transparent layers, bounces off the paper behind it, and reflects back at our eyes, giving it a glow. She talks not only about painting, but about spattering, using non-brush objects to make textures, and much more.She covers the emotions of painting. She says ""art tends to be stuffy, pretentious, and cerebral."" Instead, she pushes us to be relaxed and free. Practice every day, even for a few minutes. Buy inexpensive but good quality gear - don't let yourself quit out of frustration with cheap, inferior tools. Play with ""blooming"" paint and other ""errors"". Make your own color charts to know how your particular paints work. And, most of all, have patience. Let yourself rediscover a child-like awe of the world.She gives guidance on showing your artwork. Use white mats for art shows, and avoid cardboard / newsprint backings as the acid will damage the watercolor paper. Make sure the mat keeps the glass from touching the print, and look into glare free / UV blocking glass. She talks about drawing basics, for developing your starting sketches, and how to make a tic-tac-toe grid to place items of interest. She even provides a set of ""course assignments"" on things to work on, to develop your skills.There are only a few issues with the book. First, I found a few typos and layout issues that should have been caught and fixed. This isn't a self-published book; the Dummies publishing group is massive. Their editors should know by now how to proof a book. Next, the examples given for us to follow don't ramp up smoothly. First we're dabbing paint randomly on a page, and then we're constructing a full landscape. I'd like to see more steps in between about how to make trees, for example.Still, compared with the other options out there, this is a great guide with a wealth of information.

Use high quality coloring pencils for best results.Creative Suggestion: Is to put your favorite design on an overhead projector, shine it on a chosen spot on a blank canvas and trace it.

But, I am going to borrow it.  I call it sharing.I ordered several of these - different designs - but all by Dover and Marty Noble.  Of all of them, this is my favorite DESIGN  - but least favorite layout.  It doesn't take up the entire page like the rest of the books do. The design is in the center, and there is quite a bit of white, blank page, left all around it on every side.  What you see on the cover, is probably the biggest design in all of the book.  I will try to get a picture of the inside in the next few days, and post it here for you to see.Despite that, I do love the design.  (Just wish it were bigger, taking up more of the page.)  I love coloring.  It doesn't matter to me what it is, I just like to color.  I love that I have small children still (9 and 2) that I can color with, without looking completely silly (Not that I'd really care).  Coloring is relaxing.I stumbled across this book when I was looking for art supplies, and coloring books for my 17-year-old. (I typed in 'coloring book for teens' on a whim).  And I was happy to find these designs by Marty Noble.  The price was reasonable, and the quality is nice.  It's not a thick (lots of pages) coloring book like you would find for small children, only around 40 pages, I think.  But the pages aren't thin like a child's coloring book either.  They are a little thicker.  A little better quality.  Nice bold white sheets.  I'm thinking you may be able to use markers on this without them bleeding through, but I don't know for sure yet.

The paper surface is slightly on the rough side, probably owing to its recycled paper process, but smooth enough not to disrupt the coloring process. I've used four types of pencils on it, which have the following characteristics on the pages:Sanford Prismacolor Premier Colored Pencil Set, 72/Tin with New Colors: superb color laydown, rich, creamy, deepKoh-i-noor Progresso - 24 Woodless Coloured Pencils. 8758: thick, deep, solid, extremely creamy, more difficult to stay in linesLuminance 6901 Colour Pencil Set Of 38: more precise, with less thickness of color, but good shades of lighter colorPrismacolor Verithin Colored Pencils, 24 Colored Pencils(2427): extremely precise, but difficult to do anything other that lay outlines (which is their purpose, anyway)In sum, I can say this is an excellent booklet for anyone wishing to explore with colors, patterns, and shapes.

It is a two player game where one side plays the Lord of Pestilence (the diseases) and another plays the Apothecary Healers (the medicinal agents for countering the diseases). It was developed by two medical doctors who also happen to be gamers, Francis Kong and Arun Mathews. From what I've read, it is growing in popularity with medical students.When I first heard about this, the first thing I thought of was an academic paper my wife had ran across and told me about by Richard Steinman and Mary Blastos called ""A trading-card game teaching about host defence"" from 2002. The paper concluded concluded that the game was super-effective for teaching the concepts. The two are unrelated, to my knowledge, but share the same conceptual space. Both the game in the paper and The Healing Blade are games... that teach. But on to this game.It's a beautiful game. It has high-quality components, and great art. There are 20 green glass beads included to track the energy resource used, ATP (adenosine triphosphate). Each player has a full-color playmat. And most of the 90 cards have unique art. The art is definitely worth mentioning here... it would definitely hold its own against Magic: The Gathering art. Gorgeous illustratiuons. Altogether, a very impressive set of components.And then... the cards. Okay, here is where the diseases come in. Each Lord of Pestilence card has the full scientific name of the disease (Streptococcus pneumoniae or Helicobacter pylori, as examples), its abbreviated common name (S. pneumoniae, H. pylori) and a fantasy-style piece of art that represents it, plus flavortext that puts a magical spin on its real-world effect. Each Apothecary Healer card has the name of a medicine (ie, Doxycyclene) and its own art and flavortext. Aside from a small font, they are very well put together.As for gameplay... let's say that this was the funnest study session I've ever had on infectious diseases. Which is to say that as a game, the mechanics do leave a little to be desired. The rules are pretty concise and simple, but in playing we found a couple situations not covered in the rules. For instance, as the Lord of Pestilence, I found my hand of cards clogged with high-cost diseases that I was unable to play. The result was that my Apothecary Healer opponent was able to build up and have a healer combatant that could counter most diseases I could play. It could have just been a bad run, and I noticed on their site a rules revision is in progress. So... the current gameplay isn't tight, mechanics-wise... but as I see it, that's not an issue. Because mechanics are not the point.What this game represents is a great step in the right direction for games that teach. If I were a medical student, I would absolutely love this game. This beats the heck out of a dry textbook. Granted, it doesn't replace the textbook, but it is a great supplement that presents the material in a way that activates different parts of the brain. This would be a great supplement to a class on pathogens. It slaps a fun theme on the subject of infectious diseases and how to fight them, and runs with it. I hands-down recommend this for any med student out there. For gamers? Not so much. But keep your eye out: the next rules revision may very well put this mechanically closer to the games we play just for fun. I suspect we may start seeing more hobby-quality games whose primary purpose is to help us learn. And I like that!",4.0,Great teaching tool on infectious diseases,1303430400,"04 22, 2011",Toys_and_Games,1.0

The drugs are all impressive looking fantasy heroes, and the microbes are all scary demons, but the form, setting, weaponry, etc. that each takes is almost entirely arbitrary, which can be confusing and is a huge missed opportunity to make learning easier.For example, Ciprofloxacin and Levofloaxcin are two related drugs that have some subtle but important differences. But from the way that they're depicted on the cards, you'd never guess they had anything to do with each other. Levo is a man wearing green armor standing in a green wooden background carrying a spear with blades on the end. Cipro is a woman in a blue and pink dress carrying a short dagger on a largely white and pink background. In fact, Cipro ends up looking at lot like Metronidazole, Ampicillin, and Tetracycline, which creates a clear visual linkage between 4 drugs that really couldn't be more different.You might also think that Imipenem/cilastin, an extremely broad-spectrum combination therapy that is described as ""Elite warriors!"" on the card, might look particularly imposing. But no, they look just like all the others. The microbes are only a little better. F. tularensis looks like a rabbit, but why antrhax is a dragon surrounded by firey butterflies, I have no idea. You also might think they'd make the gram positive bugs have purple themed cards and the negatives red, but no, it's often the opposite, which again creates confusing visual associations that I'd have had to consciously reverse.The list goes on and on. This is a great concept that could be fixed with a major artwork overhaul, but for the moment, there's plenty to learn in microbiology without associating every bug and drug with an unrelated fantasy character.",2.0,Needs an artwork overhaul,1331251200,"03 9, 2012",Toys_and_Games,0.0

You can add more tiles to the twenty-four you are initially alloted, so as long as it works out that each player would receive an equal amount of turns.  If you have four players for example, you could add twenty-eight or thirty-two tiles instead.  You can opt to play a longer game, or you can play the standard game which lasts about an hour, sometimes less, depending on how quick players are in forming words.The variant listed in the manual is a welcome addition to the main game and was received well by my son and me.  It gave us more options in the beginning, as we were often struggling to find words using the normal setup.  The variant also suggests the use of a sand timer (not included in the main game) to help speed things along, which is a good idea if you are pressed for time.  I normally leave out timers in the games we review to encourage the kids to think about all of their options.Since there are seventy-one tiles and you are using less than a third of them in each game, the replay value ends up being extremely high.  Add the fact that you have pawns blocking each other's movements and bonus tiles that provide various effects...two games end up never being the same.Aside from its replayability, it is very educational.  This game forces players to expand their vocabulary and adapt to the letters that they are presented with.  This would be an excellent game for kids as it promotes learning and creative thinking.  Using this game as a practice aid for spelling and vocabulary in the classroom is very doable.  The teacher (or parent) could pick and choose which twenty-four tiles are in the game, based on the kinds of words that they are practicing at the time.My son struggled at first, not understanding the difference between laying a tile down and starting a word where the pawn was.  He quickly came to see after a few turns however that you can strategically place your letter tiles in such a way that your pawn could utilize it.  The game went very quickly (about thirty minutes) and we tied at fifty-nine points each.  For our first game, I stacked the ""deck"" with more greens and yellows to help ease him into learning the game.  He was trying out different letter combinations and sometimes asked if what he proposed was a word...which is exactly the kind of interaction that I was hoping would result from playing together.  He was being encouraged to think outside of the box and expand his vocabulary...a plus for any parent worth his (or her) two cents.Overall, this is an excellent game to introduce to your family on family game night.  Its high replayability allows for hours of fun, while keeping your mind and vocabulary sharp in the process.",4.0,WayWord Review by Dad's Gaming Addiction,1381190400,"10 8, 2013",Toys_and_Games,1.0

Let's find out together.When you first open the box, you will see a small rule book and a sheet that teach you how to set the game up in detail, this is a plus from the get go since they don't want to confuse you from the beginning.This game is played in 15 rounds, a player has to balance his time/action between work, service, extracurricular, and/or academics to get a better chance of getting into the colleges he or she wants to go. While a person is balancing these 4 items, they are also competing with each other on scholarships and getting into selective schools that have very limited opening so they can maximize they point at the end of the game.One thing I like about this game the cards are not generic cards that simply says work, service, extracurricular,  academics, they actually have very detail description of what that role does, i,e, a SERVICE card says Volunteer Soup Kitchen, one could earn PERSONAL STORIES and LETTERS OF REC if he/she decide to put enough time into it and these elements are helpful in applying for colleges and/or scholarships later on in the game.Perhaps another WORK card says you are a LION TAMER could potentially earn you lots of MONEY, PERSONAL STORIES and LETTER OF REC. A EXTRACURRICULARS card could be MODERN DANCE, SNOWBOARDING, ULTIMATE FRISBEE or a GAME design.You get the idea of this game, so is this a good game? I would say this is a great tool for those student just enter high school in their 9th and 10th grade who can prepare their college application process early. Although you can play this game in less than an hour but when you are actually preparing in real life will take a couple of years to build your portfolio to apply for colleges.And did I mention the maker of this game is University of Southern California ???

Perhaps because of this, a while ago I was approached by the makers of this game to play and review it.(I did receive a complimentary copy to do so)This is my first board game review, so please bear with me. In order to do so, I wanted to take advantage of playing with the target audience of the game--my 17 1/2 year old nephew who's a good kid, does well in school, but is very apathetic about pretty much everything, including getting ready and applied to college.Components: The game comes in a fairly small, compact box and has good quality card stock cards. The artwork and colors are very utilitarian and have a good education look that is nice and I enjoy it. You will need a bunch of paper clips on hand as these are used to track info on the cards. I'd recommend plastic or coated ones so as not to scrape up the cards any as you slide them up and down.The Basic Premise: The goal of Application Crunch is just that, to show high school students the process of how to apply to college in a way that makes sense, is fun and interesting. It's played over a series of rounds using cards and action points in a variety of ways to track the progress of the players in multiple facets of their high school life and 'sending' those trackers off to achieve different rewards, ultimately resulting in applying and hopefully being accepted at the type of college you believe will bring you the most victory points.How it Works: To start, everyone draws a character card, a family finances card and two envelopes. Each character has a special ability to give them a slight leg up in different aspects of the game. Each player in turn draws a productivity card telling them how many action points they get along with some fun, light flavor text in the mood of a typical HS kid's week. The player then uses those action points to either draw cards, move up a level on the cards they already have, or add cards to your envelopes and/or add the envelopes to an event or college (thus 'applying' to that school).The cards are divided into extracurricular, academics, work, and service along with question cards which work a little differently. Each of these activities have levels and theme appropriate names that provide benefits for achieving them. The higher up, the better and more versatile--more cash, awards, etc. This is where the paper clips are used to track that information. The question cards are drawn and asked by the active player. These are open ended trivia-type questions about getting ready for college and/or applying. A few answers are on each card but I'd say it's pretty much up to the group which are best and who should get the rewards, usually a free level up.After all players have taken all their actions, a new event or college is put into play to be applied to and the last one in the line is set aside. Those whose envelopes were submitted to that event/college are opened and its determined who were admitted and/or given other awards.Once all events/colleges have gone through this process, the game is over and you determine who won. You have to have enough money to go to the college you end up selecting that you got into. Each college gives you victory points according to the different icons you achieved and which school you went to. So, a technical school will give you more points for awards in engineering and science while a private school will emphasize high grades.Whoever has the most points is the winner.My take: The game was surprisingly cohesive and enjoyable and my nephew felt the same way. You learn much about the application process and what it entails to get into the college of your choice. The game is fairly quick and simple but has many interesting decisions to make. I liked how it showed how you need to balance your life between, academics, work and extracurricular activities. The trivia cards are great, too, as they can start good discussions about what to expect and what needs to be done. However, I do think they would work much better with 3-4 players. The icons were easy to read and the rules are fairly easy to follow. The end game scoring is a bit of math, but that's good anyway, right?Overall, Application Crunch is a well designed game that achieves its purpose in that it is both informative/educational and fun to play. My nephew and I both agree that it would not be our first, second or third choice to play off the game shelf as it really isn't that kind of fun. However, to be used for its intended purpose, it gets high marks. I'd highly recommend it to any and every education counselor (or any youth counselor, really), ecclesiastic leader, teacher or any friend or relative concerned with the prospects of their family members in high school.",4.0,"Educating in a Non-boring way (Yes, it's fun AND useful!)",1332288000,"03 21, 2012",Toys_and_Games,1.0

In my experience, games that are specifically designed to be educational often lack any actual gameplay.Thankfully, this was not the case with Application Crunch. The game plays with a very ""Eurogame"" feel with cards dictating the number of actions you get each turn. Each player also has a character class, which is essentially a high school clique stereotype that gives that player a small advantage for performing various actions.Overall my students and I enjoyed the game. It had a surprising amount of decisions to be made while still playing quickly and not leading to any kind of over-analysis that can bog down a game. It also very much gave a feel of that senior year rush when a student has 20 things they want to do and only 4 hours of free time. All that was conveyed well and drove home the importance of prioritizing.So overall, this game is a fantastic recommendation for a high school club - or even better a guidance office. The only drawback is it still has a deck of cards that ask questions about preparing for college. That gives it the scent of ""educational"" game that scares off many of my kids from voluntarily playing it when they are faced with an entire cabinet of choices.So I would rate it 5 stars as an educational game. And 4 stars as a game where education isn't the primary goal.",4.0,Good game - especially for an educational game!,1332288000,"03 21, 2012",Toys_and_Games,1.0

It helps that many of the rules don't kick in until after everybody has taken four turns around the table.It is basically an occupy and hold game for 3 to 5 players, set in 19th Century New York City.  No dice, very little randomness, with elements of bluffing, negotiation, and intimidation.  You occupy wards with a combination of placing ward bosses, and backing them up with political favor tokens.  You earn political favors by bringing immigrants ashore and then organizing them in your wards. There are four immigrant groups, each player will try to control one or two of these groups as she battles to win mayoral elections over a 16-year period.Players can form alliances to beat up whoever is ahead, but if you devote too many resources to these political fights you may lose control of your own base and fall behind your consolidating competitors.Give it a try!",5.0,"Simple mechanics, complex interactions",1376179200,"08 11, 2013",Toys_and_Games,1.0

The game consists of cards, a quick set up guide, a rule book, and some envelopes.  You will need to provide some paperclips in order to play.  I was impressed by the components.  The cards are good quality, nicely designed, and easy to read.  I liked the colors and the layout of the cards.The one issue that I had with components is that you will be putting paper clips on your cards and moving them up and down.  We used metal paper clips and this scratched the cards.  This doesn't really affect game-play; it's more of an aesthetics issue.  I would make sure that you use plastic or coated paper clips when you play.The goal of the game is to apply to different colleges throughout the game.  At the end of the game you will decide which college to attend based on which colleges accepted you.  After you decide which college to attend you will score points based on how you played throughout the game.  The player with the most points wins.At the beginning of the game everyone draws a character card and a family finances card.  The different characters give special abilities.  For example, the die hard can take five actions when he draws a card that only gives him 3 actions.  Your family finance card can give you some bonus cash to start with.Each turn you draw a productivity card that tells you how many action points you will have.  The cards have amusing flavor text, such as the Up Late Gaming Card; ""It's 3am - time to put down the controller.""  The productivity cards all have what actions can be used for printed on them, which was a nice touch.Actions are used to do many things.  You can draw activity cards.  The activity cards are divided into extracurricular, academics, work, and service.  You can also use an action to level up one of your activity cards.  This is just like leveling up a planeswalker in Magic, the Gathering.  Each activity card has different levels to it.  Some of the levels have icons that represent letters of recommendations, good grades, money, or other bonuses.  To level up a card you spend the actions that it specifies on the card and you move your paper clip up that level.Actions can also be used to draw question cards.  You read the question to all of the players and let them answer it.  The questions are all related to college, such as ""What is the difference between AA, BA, and BS degrees?""  When you ask a question you get to level up an academic card one level.  You also get to decide which player had the best answer to the question and they also get to level up an academic card.  The question cards have answers to the questions printed on them, so that kids can compare the answers they hear with what's on the card.You can also use actions to put cards in your application envelopes and to put your envelope next to a college or event.  There is a series of cards that come out during the game.  These represent colleges and other things, such as college fairs and financial aid.  To apply for these things you use an action to ""submit"" an envelope next to one.  Every turn you look through the envelopes of the players that applied to that school to see who got in.At the end of the game everyone looks through the schools that they were accepted to and decides which one to attend.  You must have acquired enough money to pay for that school by the end of the game.  You then calculate your score based on how you have leveled up your cards throughout the game.  Each school gives you points depending on how many icons you have earned throughout the game.  For example art school will give points for cards that have levels of fine art, while the selective state school gives more points for academics.I played a two player game with a friend who likes Eurogames.  The game is for 3-4 players but we were just trying to figure out how everything worked.  We found that the mechanics worked together well.  My friend liked how asking a question was a good way to game the system, as you could level up a card for one action when some cards required two actions to level up.I played another game with the same friend and two high school students.  One student was a senior and had already applied and been accepted to college.  The other student was a sophomore and hasn't started applying to schools.  Both students said that this wasn't the kind of game that they would choose to play for fun.  However, they both said that they enjoyed playing it and that it taught them a lot about the application process.  They said that it showed how one had to be well rounded and balance things like academics and work.  They also really seemed to enjoy the question cards, which brought up some good discussion.Things I really liked about the game:I liked the leveling up mechanic.I liked the little envelopes.  My 5 year old daughter almost ran away with them when she saw them.I liked how the game forces you to think about different aspects of applying to college.  You are forced to look at your money situation, grades, service activities, and the like.  The students I played with said that it was eye opening to see that they had to focus on so many different things when looking into college.I would recommend this game to anyone who works with college bound students.  Playing the game can be a great springboard for discussion.  I liked how the game made the students think concretely about something that can seem abstract and distant.  College seemed almost like a myth when I was in high school.  It was something that I would eventually go to and that was all I really thought about it.  This game does a good job of providing hooks for students to use when thinking about college.  They can gain some insight to navigating the application process.  Any game that can be fun and teach  at the same time is a good game in my opinion.",5.0,Increase Your College Knowledge,1331251200,"03 9, 2012",Toys_and_Games,1.0

I feel abused after playing it. the abuse was both mental and physical. I would go so far as to call it torture. I was the victim of a lot of Kickstarter hype and got suckered into buying it. Never again.Tammany hall is an area control Game. The very attractive board is a map of old NY with all the wards in various shades of earth tones. Each of up to 5 players has a pile of ""Bosses"" that they place in wards each turn to influence the immegrant community to vote for them in an election. There are 4 different Imigrant groups: German, English, Irish and Italian. All the groups except the Italians are on the board at set up. All are randomly placed except the Irish are in Tammany Hall. Game turns are seperated into 4 Terms of 4 years each. Each turn You choose to place two Bosses in wards of your choice or a Boss and one immegrant cube from a group randomly chosen from a bag and placed in on the board representing those straight off the boat. The cube comes with a political favor chip of the same color that you will use to vote during the election phase that comes at the end of each 4 year term. The object of the game is to win elections and dominate the most wards in order to get victory points and more political favor chips by having the most of any immigrant group in your Wards. Elections take place in a ward order marked by arrows on the board. If a ward is contested the players with bosses in that ward engage in a blind ballot using the political favor chips they have accumulated as votes. (Note: there is NO auction or bidding in the game as stated in the Amazon discription) they can only use the color that is represented by the immigrants present in the ward at the time of the election. The winner gets the ward for scoring and all other bosses are removed from that ward. The person who wins the most wards after an election gets to be the Mayor who then gets to assign city jobs to the rest of the players that give them certain powers that affect the game. For example; the police chief can arrest any immirgrant anywhere once per year. Then there is the power to slander. players get 3 slander chips that they can use to remove other bosses in the course of the game at the rate of 1 per term.All of this probably sounds pretty cool and to be honest the Theme kind of works through its abstraction. But it's a vicious, nasty game where you are forced into backstabbing conflict. Now normally I would love that but the problem is that the game has no balance at all. One or two bad first moves in the game will sentence a player to 90 minutes of frustrating tedium with no hope of recovery because the game doesn't give you a mechanism to recover. If you can't win wards you can't get favor chips by having the most immigrants and without favor chips you have no votes. Because territory is tight you are forced into conflicts you can't win for no good reason because your options when you are behind become so limited. You have to play your bosses somewhere. The word used most by my game group on breaking out this game was ""tedious"". It took way to long to play for what it is.I feel I should mention the quality and price as well. The art is nice though nothing that might require an art department and the board and box are of exceptional quality. I would go so far to say that it is overkill but The parts themselves seem pretty standard off the shelf chips and meeples though the meeples might be custom. The bottom line is you could get any map of anywhere and apply a similar theme ( maybe the Mafia in Sicily ) and buy a few components from a game store or use components from another game and create your own better game using the same mechanics. I buy a lot of games with way more components for a much lower price. I think a fair price for what you get would be on the order of 35 dollars delivered. But that being said, the game is too broken to pay any price. It will be quickly forgotten on your game shelf. the one redeeming quality it may have is that if you play this game with people you don't like they will probably never contact you again.",1.0,Waist of a really nice box.,1363478400,"03 17, 2013",Toys_and_Games,0.0

They will understand the most advantageous locations to seek as well as the best way to use or distribute the city council powers. Less experienced players will have a tough time making the most of their very limited resources.Half of the fun is in the real world politics (appropriate for the theme). Forming alliances, and sometimes breaking them, is sometimes necessary to take out whoever is in the lead. Fights for territories can not be avoided, and they often occur between ""alliances."" This constant conflict is by far the biggest reason why this game gets so tense. I get so nervous with each turn, that it can truly stress me out.In response to those who claim that the game is unbalanced and that it is impossible for one to ""bounce back"" after losing, I will admit that it is extremely difficult. However, it is certainly not impossible, and it does not mean that the ""loser"" will not have any fun. Let's not forget that in many of these types of games, the loser (or losers) is the one who has the power to DECIDE who the winner is by dedicating all resources to screwing someone over or pushing them to victory.

Some even go so far as to accuse Tammany of connivance in this so-called rampant criminality. What am I to do? I can't have this. Something has to be done.""Tammany Hall is one of the simplest and one of the most viciously political games I have played. These two statements seem contradictory so let's take a look.The Basics - ""You see this knife? I'm gonna teach you to speak English with this ****ing knife!""Tammany Hall is a political control board game in which you play out the unprincipled battles for votes in New York in the late nineteenth century. Using muscle, political tricks and skullduggery you aim to crush your rival and emerge as the dominant political power in Old New York. To do this each turn you can either drop two heavies onto the board (to ensure votes come your way in a precinct) or drop one heavy and move some poor befuddled immigrants into an area (which gets you political influence).  See just a choice of two actions ... easy right?Well after four turns of this there's an election to see who gets mayor (and lots of bonus points). The elections run ward by ward across the city and you win elections by counting up your heavies (who are guaranteed to 'arrange' the vote for you) and blind bidding political influence chips. And this is it gets really, really fun. You stare your friends in the eye and casually explain how you will BURN them if they dare to try contesting the election. You calmly point out that if they fight you here they will lose the next wards they are fighting for and have NOTHING. They of course calmly counter that they have been so kind to the immigrants that their voting power is unassailably and you should beg forgiveness.  Then you reveal your hidden chips and the winners yells out in victory!The Twist - ""The appearance of law must be upheld, especially when it's being broken.""After the election the player with the most wards is declared mayor and scoops up enough victory points to cement their lead. Then they must assign political offices to each of the losers -- these offices are powerful in that they allow these coat-tail grabbing to cheat! To protect a ward from influence, to arrest (remove) immigrant populations, to provide free housing (move populations around) and even just rack in extra influence for doing nothing! And these scoundrels will use their political offices to tear you down -- you! the one who gave them the offices. Ungrateful curs!And More! - ""That, my friends, is the minority vote.""You can slander an opponent forcing his heavies out of a ward and throwing their political machine into confusion. You can control an immigrant population and win even more influence. There are bonus wards which, when won, change the political landscape. Ah, it's tricky rising to the top in old New York!The Play - ""If you get all of us together, we ain't got a gang, we've got an army.""It's a really tight, really focused game. You never have resources to do what you want to do and the other players always have the ability to take down the leader.Now there is one problem in play in that if a player fails utterly in the early round it is impossible for them to catch up alone. And this is the key, the last player should parlay his status as a wild card (he has nothing to lose) to team up with the second player to take down the leader. If you work alone you are either the leader (and crushing all before you -- good luck with that) or you are missing opportunities to ally and snatch victory. Once you've learned to team up (like ragged hyenas) and then turn on your allies in an instant you've learned to play this game.The Box - ""Remember the first rule of politics. The ballots don't make the results, the counters make the results. The counters. Keep counting.""The components (box, board, meeples) are really nice.

They allow children to open up in a playful way, and create wonderful conversation starters between kids and adults.  With my own child, they are a fun way to chat and learn new things about each other.  With kids and families in therapy, they create opportunities to assess needs and deepen relationships between family members, or between client and therapist.There are so many ways to use them, too!  You can just draw from the deck and shre, or you can pair these cards with another favorite game.  For example, I sometimes bring the cards out along with Checkers or Chess, and anytime someone loses a game piece to the other player, they draw a card and complete the sentence.  I have also paired the cards with Jenga, Don't Break the Ice, Candyland, Chutes and Ladders, and many other childhood games.Kids love the adorable artwork, and the fact that they can answer their own way makes these cards a non-threatening way to get to know someone new or deepen a relationship with someone trusted.I highly recommend this and other Bright Spots products to anyone with children from about age three (adults read the card aloud for the child) to adult.",5.0,Wonderful product I've used for years!,1293753600,"12 31, 2010",Toys_and_Games,1.0

Most of them could be played without actually having to buy anything, and most of the best party games don't require any components at all (like Truth or Dare, Have You Ever, or Quarters. OK, Quarters has components, but not many game companies are going to start selling rolls of quarters and pitchers of beer). The end result is that, while I see lots of party games, I don't tend to like very many of them.The Game of Things, from Hasbro, is one I like. In fact, it's one of the few I break out on a regular basis. It has the potential for a huge amount of hilarious fun, and it's equally playable with a room full of teenagers or a geriatric nursing home. Like nearly every party game ever, it relies on not playing with idiots to have fun, but I think that applies to nearly anything, from Risk to water-skiing (there are exceptions - it can be hilarious to play Red Light, Green Light with a retard).In Things (I'm abbreviating the name because I'm lazy), you've got a big deck of descriptions. These descriptions might be 'Things you would like to do with chocolate', or 'Things you would do if you could change genders for a day'. One person reads the description out loud, and everyone writes a thing that would be an answer, like 'eat it' or 'play Darjeeling.' Then you go around the table and take turns guessing who wrote what.Like most party games, the actual scoring is almost completely irrelevant. You don't really care who wins. The point is to hang out and have fun with people you may or may not like, unless you're playing with my father-in-law, in which case the point is to be as horribly inappropriate as possible (when asked for 'Things you wish you could check out in the library', he wrote 'the librarian'. In all fairness, I wrote 'whiskey and whores,' so it was kind of a tie for worst place).It's tough to write an in-depth review of a game as simple as The Game of Things. You read a card, everyone writes an answer, then you guess who wrote what. That's really it. It's not like there's strategy, outside playing like my son and writing answers that sound like someone else wrote them (like for 'Things cannibals think about while dining,' he wrote, 'I wish I had a good dark beer,' and everyone thought I wrote that. I wrote 'Mmm, tastes like chicken.') But even though it's not very deep, if you can get the right crowd of miscreants together, this can be a lot of fun. I've laughed myself through dozens of games of Things, although it's not always safe to play with kids (especially if you're playing with people who would answer 'Things you should not photograph' with 'your junk'. Like me).Apparently, Hasbro was trying to appeal to collector-types when they made The Game of Things, because it comes in a really nice wooden box. There's no reason it couldn't have come in a cardboard box like every other game, but the wooden slide-top box is a really nice touch. And the pretty box makes people think it must be better than other games, which it really is not, but they don't know that, so they'll play with you.On a scale that goes from Strip Spin the Bottle to Apples to Apples, The Game of Things falls somewhere around Taboo. It's a good time, but not as much fun as being 19 and getting naked with a roomful of pretty girls while you drink yourself into a stupor. But then, you can play Things with your in-laws, and if you play Strip Anything with your in-laws, please don't tell me about it.",5.0,Party Game Review - The Game of Things,1281744000,"08 14, 2010",Toys_and_Games,1.0

Well, when he opened the gift, his eyes lit up and he hugged it.  That first night, he insisted on sleeping with Llama; in the middle of the night, my daughter heard him yell out, ""WOW! Llama! YAY!"" as he discovered it still next to him.  The llama is the perfect size for carrying around constantly, sleeping with, and even fitting into his toy barn and train.

This book adds yet another view on the Romulans  inconsistent with two most prevalent ones already out there, making it  impossible to reconcile the three.LUG's Romulan Core Setting breaks down  into three books.  The first one goes into mind set, government, ships,  ranks, etc... The basis on what you need to run a Romulan Campaign.  Then  their is a book on how to make a Romulan character and finally an adventure  manual.Though most Romulan devotees will find yet another view  irritating, the books do provide an coherent setting and background.  The  layout is fairly well done and there is a fairly good table of contents and  good handouts.The overall quality of work in this book is poor to fair.  If you expect good graphics and pictures you will be disapointed.  The  drawings for the most part appear to have been done by a 5 year old and add  nothing to the narratives when they appear.  Where an image could have  aided the narratives there are none.An example in the book is when it  speaks of the alien race the Romulans fought with during their 30 year  silence, as mentioned in the Series.  The book goes into alien mindset,  technology and appearance.  Yet when you look for an image of these beings  you are treated to a thick line drawing a 3rd grader might have  drawn.For the price I would have hoped that they would have gotten  someone who could have illustrated this professionally, brought the other  two authorized views in conjunction with this one and added color, maybe  photos to it.",2.0,A core setting view for Star Trek RPG on the Romulans,933033600,"07 27, 1999",Toys_and_Games,0.0

The only complaint I have is the art work. For the price, I was expecting stills from the series on glossy paper; instead, I found poorly drawn black and white (green and white actually) on plain ordinary paper. There are three books in this box set, and two full color posters the first being a map of romulan space, and the second depicting romulan uniforms and starships in full color.The first book details romulan life and culture. The Way of D'era, the romulan philosophy is interesting. We are also shown how the empire functions, its history, the structure of the Romulan star navy. There is a section on the various worlds which can be explored in Romulan space as well as Romulus and Remus.The second book gives rules for creating romulan characters, as well as guidlines for running an all romulan campaign. There are new traits and skills presented which are romulan specific. The most interesting section is scions of the empire. This section gives stats and descriptions of the movers and shakers of the empire. Included is Senator Kassus, a character whose shadow is felt in the LUG product &quot;A Fragile Peace&quot;.The third book includes two adventures. The first &quot;The Gentera Incident&quot; is an adventure for an all romulan cast. The second, &quot;Duty or Conscience&quot; is an adventure for a cast of starfleet characters.

I thought my second grader might have fun peeling off the states and putting them in their place on the map.  Unfortunately, he didn't think it was much fun at all.  The board is sturdy, colorful and the states have cartoon like images on them depicting iconic state symbols.  My son played with this once and won't pick it up again...not even while sick or in the car. He said it was just boring.  From a construction point, the seam that runs down the center of the map severely creases any state ""sticker"" left on the board when it's closed.  So, you have to pull off all of the ""stickers"" before you put away the map or the center states will be permanently crumpled.  There is no place to really store the states unless you want to reposition each state back onto the sheet from which they originally came.  It's not a bad toy.  My son just didn't really like it.

Many excuses are given, but it is important to start this education while kids are young and the Mudpuppy Ballerina Money Bank is a good place to start. This bank does more than just encourage kids to save money- it also helps to develop a sense of charity and frugality.How does this bank accomplish so much? It does this through its modified design, which includes three different slots: One for Spend; one for Save; and one for Share. When money is dropped into one of the three slots, it is collected in a separate chamber. This separation and the three different options help to teach kids about saving for the future, saving money for a large purchase, and sharing money with others.What I like most about this bank is that it encourages kids to think about the different uses for money and the importance of giving. It is a simple design and concept and the three different slots and labels encourage kids to ask questions. It sparks their curiosity and gets them thinking about money, different ways to save, charity, etc. It shows kids that there is much more to money than simply spending it today and hoping for more tomorrow.As for cons, I can think of only a few issues with this bank and the main issue I have is with the physical size. The bank is only about 4.5 inches in diameter and the individual chambers will fill up in no time. This could discourage some kids to save more money. Once a chamber is full, some kids will immediately want to empty the compartment and use the money. I am also not too sure about the small padlock. Unless a child has untrustworthy siblings, I don't think a lock is necessary. Not only that, but the lock is small and the keys are tiny- It would be very easy to accidentally lose these keys.Financial education is important and the Mudpuppy Ballerina Money Bank is a simple yet effective device for teaching kids the value of a dollar. It would be nice if it was a little bit larger, but it is still a good savings bank and its educational value goes far beyond the basics.",4.0,Ballerina Money Bank Encourages Financial Education,1299456000,"03 7, 2011",Toys_and_Games,1.0

Also, the scale of the pieces is smaller than you might think.We purchased ours through Land of Nod but it is the same exact Painter's Palette set.

May I suggest you hold onto the sticker sheets but remove the vinyl sticker borders that's not needed, so you can place unused stickers at random for easy transport because the kit does not come with a storage for unused stickers. My 21 month old absolutely looks forward to this every day that I have to save the activity for a treat after I've gotten him to clear his toys and other little chores. A month ago when he first got this he used to place stickers completely at random sometimes atop each other but the more we play the more aware he has become of the background scene and purpose that he pays attention to which side up he's sticking and can create fun scenes like the giant octopus tackling a pirate.

Indeed it is cardboard, but a very thick, heavy type that seems extremely sturdy. We've had this bank for about 8 months and it has been great. It's withstanding the amount of use it gets (putting money in regularly and opening and closing it a couple times a month), the design looks cute in my child's room, and it is perfectly functional as a bank w/3 compartments. Obviously it's not going to last forever, but it makes an excellent ""first bank"" and the price is less than the plastic banks of similar design. Actually, considering the way technology is going, kids aren't going to walk around with piles of change the way they used to b/c everything is going electronic anyway, so I figure we'll probably end up going straight from this to a wallet.The only complaint I have about it is that after 6 mos. or so of use, the lock got stuck and we couldn't get it open with the key anymore, so we had to cut it off--but I just put one of those tiny luggage locks on it instead, which fit perfectly (you know, those ones I think the airlines don't even allow anymore, so I have a bunch of them w/matching keys that my kids love to play with).Anyway, my son thinks the lock is really fun and was also excited to have his own keychain and key that he keeps hidden in a drawer away from his little sister. ;)I love that it has the 3 compartments; this has really encouraged my child to save and give some of his funds.

The magnet goes all the way through the shape, and my son likes to &#34;stamp&#34; them on his magna doodle. This is, by the way, an activity I highly recommend. We stumbled on the observation that these numbers (and the Melissa and Doug letters) can be used to stamp the Magna Doodle, and for a while that was pretty much all my son wanted to do with his time. He is almost 3, and well ahead on reading and math, and I think that this stamping activity had something to do with his speed. I should say that the paper covering on the numbers does wear off fast, but then these numbers get a lot of use. Also there are three of each number (because the set allows you to model simple equations), so even if your kids loses numbers like mine does it takes a while before you run out. I probably bought my first box a year and a half ago, and I haven't opened the fourth box yet, so keeping my son in numbers is costing me about $50 a year. I originally bought  a plainer box from the same company - I had some idea that all the shapes ON this brightly patterned set would distract him from the shape of the number itself - and then I switched to this far cuter set once he knew his numbers.",5.0,very cute,1357862400,"01 11, 2013",Toys_and_Games,1.0

When you pick up the pieces, many times there are no way to tell what you are holding, so you have to go by the shape rather than the picture to put it together.  Eg. one piece has just a colorful dot - with just this information, you cannot visually look for the next piece since it is not a continuation of a picture. You either have to consult the picture on the box to see which dot comes next, or try out each piece until you happen to come across the shape that fits the piece (which is my daughter's method).Similarly, the body part of the caterpillar is cut in such a way that you are looking at a green puzzle piece that all looks similar except for the different cut. No way to tell whether you are holding the caterpillar's neck, back, tail or the belly. So the way to complete this puzzle is mainly to work from the corner/side and find the pieces that fit each other by shapes.  While my daughter can complete the puzzle, this is not my (nor my daughter's) favorite.  I prefer puzzle pieces that when you pick up, you can tell what part of the picture you are holding and visually look for the next piece.PROS:- Beautiful shiny surface with brilliant color- Nice thick cardboard pieces (about 2mm thick) that is durable but not hard to put together or pull apartCONS:- Abstract picture.  Except for the face of the caterpillar and the fruits, you have to put the puzzle together by the shape rather than the picture.I bought this puzzle a little cheaper at Barnes & Nobles for $11.95 (instead of the current Amazon price of $15.99).I have bought puzzles by Ravensburger, Melissa & Doug, Mudpuppy and Kumon but our all time favorite is Briarpatch's ""The Good Night Moon"" puzzle.",3.0,Beautiful puzzle but pieces are too abstract,1371600000,"06 19, 2013",Toys_and_Games,0.0

My husband thought it might be because the Pantone pages show about 20 different variations on the color (cherry red, tomato red, burgundy red, wine red) etc. and he thought it might be better to just have ONE color to represent the concept (just cherry red for red) and that that might be the issue.  These cards looked well made and since my girls had destroyed a ""heavy cardstock"" style of flash cards before, they were the best option.  The ring is plastic, and one set (this one) the ring stays together better than the other set (the ABCs one).  A drop of super glue should fix that.  The cards are very heavy cardboard, and have a glossy sheen on them, which makes them easy to clean up (wipe off food...) and also easy for the girls to turn the cards (2.5 and 4 yr old).  The quality is high in my opinion.  the words are easy to read, and the shapes are easy to distinguish for the most part.  The bunny with the square tooth was odd in my opinion - I get it, but the square was very small.  It does help them identify the shapes in real world settings, but I was looking for something more basic than that.  My only complaint on the set is that for the colors the front side has it on the animal (for example, the blue elephant, since that's the pic you see on this page), but it is set in the solid color background (purple).  When you turn the card over, it shows you the color ""blue"" in a circle, but the background of that page isn't blue, it is purple.  So when you ask a 2.5 yr old what color that is, half the time she says purple, half the time blue.  I'd have preferred the whole back side of the card be the identifying color ""blue"".  The ironic part is that the shape cards are this way - the back is the same color inside the shape as outside it, so I may end up using those to identify colors as well as shapes, since there won't be any confusion as to which part I'm asking her to identify.  All in all, I'd buy them again, but they certainly weren't exactly what I was looking for in terms of a more straightforward approach than the pantone books.

She does ask for help every once in awhile, i just remind her to use the pictures as clues and the flat edges go on the outside and she is able to continue without me. Its pretty amazing, she will sit and work on this puzzle for 20 minutes quietly, finish, I will dole out several high-fives, and then she takes it apart and starts over. Im so happy she got this puzzle and I will definitely buy her more from this brand. You cant go wrong.

So we bought this one as a physical puzzle for her to practice spatial pattern recognition. The pieces are big and the puzzle picture image is well chosen for few redundant elements and enough different colored objects. The pieces are nicely divided up so each one has a distinct image that can be easily identified within the overall picture. My daughter still struggles to get all the correct pieces in place but it is easy to explain how the bit with the black and white is part of the cow, the pink is the pig and so on. The edge pieces have a purple flowered border so we can show her to start with those to map out the boundary.My only quibble is that if the cardboard gets wet, the backing will peel off and the piece becomes essentially useless - so if your toddler likes to sprinkle her toys with her sippy cup like ours does, that will reduce the durability of this toy.

She already was a puzzle lover, but we needed to find some that were a little more challenging for her than just the 2 or 3 piece matching ones, but not overly difficult for her either.  She can't yet do this one fully one her own, but it does engage her if we sit with her and she loves the challenge and resists our help as long as possible.  She loves this and the butterfly puzzle we got her from the same brand.  We will definitely buy her the other other puzzles (sea life and dinosaurs) that I've seen here as well.The puzzle pieces are not AS durable as some of her wooden puzzles, but still plenty strong, and much better than your typical cardboard jigsaw you find.  I can't decide if I like the re-usable pouch or not.  In some ways, I like that it is less bulky than some of the wooden boxes/frames that her other puzzles come in, especially while she is doing the puzzle, but it also feels like it won't last as long (though still quite durable itself).  It seems less stack able or organized when we're putting her puzzles and toys away as well, but that's minor and not worth taking stars away from my rating in my opinion (again, I see both pros and cons, just trying to give all my thoughts here in case people are wondering).I like that she can easily put the pig together, then the cow, and then the barn, and then she kind of brings it all together after that.  It definitely is helping her think about how things work and fit together and keeps her engaged for quite a while.  Since I often appreciate getting other good/similar recommendations from other reviewers, I will say that we also got her the Melissa and Doug puzzles where they come with a box with 4 different (smaller but still 12 pieces) puzzles in each box.  Those are probably our favorites as she can do those completely on her own, the puzzles themselves take up a little less space, I like the clean organization of the boxes to keep them in, and the little wooden pieces are just a bit more durable.  That all said, I will gladly continue to buy her more of those and these puzzles for good variety as she loves puzzles and I am happy they keep her quietly occupied in a contained area for a while and learning how to think and strategize a bit too!",5.0,28-month-old daughter loves it,1357689600,"01 9, 2013",Toys_and_Games,1.0

I had not heard of the mudpuppy brand before, but I'm looking into see what other products they make. My son is 16 months old, so these are a great toy to help him start to point out recognizable objects and start using his words.  It is fun for us to go through the ring together or they are easy enough for him to manipulate that he can entertain himself by using them on his own. Given his age, a lot of things still end up in his mouth, including these cards. They have held up very well and aren't completely destroyed! The designs are very cute and this is something that I can see us getting a lot of use out of for the next year or two.  I liked them so much, I ordered another ring for an upcoming trip---they seem like a great plane ride activity.Also, I would highly recommend getting theSecure-A-Toy, BLACK-WHITEto go with this. I used this to strap the rings to the carseat and the stroller, so he can thumb through the cards on his own, but not lose them if he decides to throw them.

(Note, this doesn't seem to have diminished her enjoyment of it though - it lives on our kitchen floor because every time I put it away she just takes it out again!)  She's learned about all of the creatures shown in the pics too - so we've added 'seahorse' and 'starfish' to her ever-expanding vocabulary :) It's very brightly colored, and very durable.

She already was a puzzle lover, but we needed to find some that were a little more challenging for her than just the 2 or 3 piece matching ones, but not overly difficult for her either.She can't yet do this one fully one her own, but it does engage her if we sit with her and she loves the challenge and resists our help as long as possible.  She loves this and the MudPuppy farm puzzle she got as well.  We will definitely buy her the other other puzzles (sea life and dinosaurs) that I've seen of theirs.The puzzle pieces are not as durable as some of her wooden puzzles, but still plenty strong, and much better than your typical cardboard jigsaw you find.I can't decide if I like the re-usable pouch or not.  In some ways, I like that it is less bulky than some of the wooden boxes/frames that her other puzzles come in, especially while she is doing the puzzle, but it also feels like it won't last as long (though still quite durable itself).  It's less stack-able or seemingly less organized then when we're putting her puzzles and toys away, but that's minor and not worth taking stars away from my rating in my opinion (again, I see both pros and cons, just trying to give all my thoughts here in case people are wondering).This one is a little tougher than the farm puzzle as there are more similar colors and it's all butterflies/insects vs. the variety of the cow, pig, barn in the farm puzzle so she definitely struggles a bit more with this one and is more likely to ask for help or give up, but I think she'll be doing it on her own in the next few months.  They definitely help her think about how things work and fit together and keep her engaged for quite a while.Since I often appreciate getting other good/similar recommendations from other reviewers, I will say that we also got her the Melissa and Doug puzzles where they come with a box with 4 different (smaller but still 12 pieces) puzzles in each box.  Those are probably our favorites as she can do those completely on her own, the puzzles themselves take up a little less space, I like the clean organization of the boxes to keep them in, and the little wooden pieces are just a bit more durable.  That all said, I will gladly continue to buy her more of those and these puzzles for good variety as she loves puzzles and I am happy they keep her quietly occupied in a contained area for a while and learning how to think and strategize a bit too!",5.0,My 28-mth-old loves it,1357689600,"01 9, 2013",Toys_and_Games,1.0

I didn't buy from Amazon but from a toy store on impulse. It basically consists of good quality magnetic dinosaur parts, poor quality scenes and a below average quality tin box. Basically the child lays a scene sheet (thin paper with double-sided printing coated with a glossy wax layer on both sides) on the inside of the tin and assembles the dinosaur pieces on it. Each of the 2 sheets crumple easily and don't look durable for destructive kids. Mine crumpled on first use. I generally love Mudpuppy products but feel this magnetic series could have been better designed with the scenes made magnetic so that each side may hold pieces from a different dinosaur. Right now, because the scenes are not magnetic and that the tin is pretty small, the magnetic dinosaur parts have to be jumbled together as not every piece is able to fit on the tin and makes it so time consuming to sort out which parts belong to which dinosaur.

The magnets are pretty strong.

The quality of the printing on the animals (which are very cute - just not ) just isn't as crisp the photos online suggest -- which detracts slightly from the overall great quality and cute artistry. I wish the colors were a little brighter, but I guess the softness gives the animals a gentleness that they might not otherwise have.  I love how there are different versions of the animals.  As another reviewer said, many have a mom, dad, and baby to match up with.  My 2.5 year old likes it when I pick out a baby and make him ""talk"" and say ""where is my mommy/(daddy)?"" and then she searches for the mom (or dad).  She likes to make the animals ""ride"" on the tractor and feed them the apples or hay.  When we put them away, I pretend like the top of the box is a hungry mouth and she loves throwing the magnets into the mouth (kinda goofy, but at least it gets her to help a little...I guess).  They seem to stick pretty well and I haven't had any peeling issues.  If it ever goes for ten bucks, I would grab it.

The pieces are large enough for little hands to easily manipulate, however they do not lock together as securely as they could and they are not as thick or durable as the comparable Ravensburger.  While those withstood my son's desire to drool on the pieces and a gentle wipe down with a damp cloth, these began quickly dissolving at the edges, becoming even harder to fit together.I also thought the style of the artwork was not particularly attractive.  The picture did contain real animals instead of some of the fantasy scenes geared towards children.  However,  I found the colors more subdued and the more stylistic artwork less appealing.Overall, it's not a bad puzzle,  but higher quality is available at a lower cost.",3.0,You're better off with a Ravensburger...,1352592000,"11 11, 2012",Toys_and_Games,0.0

We've been working a lot on patterns and shapes, so I figured that a puzzle might be in order.  I remember playing with puzzles when I was little, but forgot that it takes a bit of an attention span.  My daughter is just not there yet.  We have yet to put the whole thing together.  24 pieces is just too much for her.  We've gotten a little more than halfway and then something distracts her.  I do like being able to teach how things fit together.  I'm hoping that when she is just a little bit older, she will be able to sit still long enough to get the rest of the puzzle together (she's just barely 2).One thing that I really like is the box.  It is sturdy and easy to open and close.  I remember puzzle boxes being really flimsy, so this was an excellent surprise.  It's also nice to know that if she sticks the puzzle piece in her mouth (which isn't happening nearly as much as it used to), it's not going to harm her.

However, if the product is not as a good as a common competitor, I just can't give it a full five stars.  This is where I find myself in judging this Mudpuppy puzzle.My kids love puzzles.  Our house is filled with all sorts of puzzles from 25 pieces to 2500 pieces.  We just completedDragon Nursery 24 Piece Floor Puzzleand had a blast with it.  In fact, it was sitting on the floor as we opened the Mudpuppy Puzzle.  Perhaps this was unfair, but it is a fact of the puzzle market.To start with, the Mudpuppy puzzle is a quality toy.  The pieces are thick and sturdy, with a glossy front and back that will make them resistant to drool and occasional food that may get on them.  They fit together nicely and have bright, vibrant colors.  The box has a nice carry handle made of rope, and the pieces fit in the box easily.  We have a Melissa and Doug puzzle the kids like, but it is hard to get the pieces put back so that the box closes.  That's not a problem here - the box is plenty big for the pieces to be put back by a kid.  The picture is nice - my 2 year old liked it, but my 5 year old thought it a little plain.  He preferred his Ravensburger and Melissa and Doug puzzle artwork far more.And there's the problem--Mudpuppy puzzle quality is similar to M&D;, but far below that of Ravensburger.  The Ravensburger pieces are just such high quality, it is hard to compete.  Plus, the Ravensburger puzzles cost less!So my review?  It's a great puzzle, quite possibly 5 stars.

By just asking him a few questions about the robots (How do you think this robot feels?  What is he thinking?  Which robots are best friends?  What are they doing today?  Where are the robots going on their trip? etc.), he started acting out stories with the finger puppets.  They held up for the entire trip, and popped out from time to time to do shows for us.

My 2 year old boy absolutely loves it so when he opened this up Christmas morning, he had it opened in no time and playing around with it. So that's the why with this purchase.As another review has mentioned, the magnets are thin, but I honestly don't know what they were expecting. It's no different than the magnet you get from a dentist with their number on it or anything similar. They are relatively strong, strong enough to hold the different scenes up on the fridge. Speaking of scenes, as in the description there are 4 of them. They are on the flip side of two pieces of paper stock with a highly glossed surface. They've got some stiffness to them, but still can be bent/creased, so beware if your little one has a knack for that.I've added 2 customer submitted photos. One just shows the scene card along with all the magnets and the second one shows some magnets ""set"" in a scene. One really cool thing about this is that the tin container is magnetic so it can be taken with you on the go for the kids to play along with whether it's in the car or at grandma and grandpa's house.Summary: For the price it's a good value. The magnets are of high quality, the scenes are really cool and the nice tin just adds to that value. This set has had a nice workout on our fridge for the last month or so.

We struggled with having the right concept, sometime even answering with synonyms and the computer still telling us the answer was wrong.  In a few cases more than one word is acceptable but if you are not on track with their line of thinking - you can be close but not close enough.  I would have to use the parent password to figure out what EXACT answer was needed.  I do mean EXACT - spelling, plural/non-plural, no synonyms, spell the number or numeric...I agree that in certain subjects spelling should be correct but sometimes learning a new concept you just need to get the concept and grasp the spelling later - even partial credit would be nice -but not with SOS.

I was thrilled when they came up with the computer version.  Every year, it gets better.  Again, they just need to make a version for the MAC.  Reviewer #2 may not realize you can set the program for easy spelling, then it will only deduct points on a mispelled problem and not count it as completely wrong.  YOU set up how harshly it grades your students.  Go into the teacher mode and where you set the grade percentages, check EASY SPELLING.As for their customer service, they used to be in Chandler, Arizona and they were wonderful.  The techs stayed on the phone with me for hours when I had computer issues when the programs first came out.  They were wonderful.  I haven't had any issues in more than a year, but I have had to talk to them a couple of times after they moved to Iowa.  Again, they were great.  Offered me free shipping and everything.  Sweet girls.I also LOVE the curriculum itself.  Vocabulary words for each lesson, spelling words, review mode, games, and just all of it.  I rearrange it a bit by placing the spelling lessons FIRST, then the regular lessons, quiz, spelling quiz, and begin again with the next spelling lesson.  Otherwise I don't think it gives the students enough time to learn the spelling words each week.  But, I have the option of moving the lessons around how I see fit.  Awesome!I would recommend Switched on Schoolhouse to ANY homeschooler.  I've been doing this a LONG time and Alpha Omega has been with me all the way.

A superb creation of Juliet Sharman-Burke and Giovanni Caselli, it combines the best features of the popular Rider-Waite-Smith (RWS) Tarot with elements of classic decks such as the Visconti-Sforza Tarot and Marseilles Tarot.  However, how does the mini version included in the Tarot Box fare?  Not as well as I would have wished, yet if you loved the Sharman-Caselli Tarot you may still consider to give this kit a try.As I hinted, the transition of the Sharman-Caselli Tarot to the mini format (3.375 x 2 inches) was not the best it could have been.  For example, there is a very small blurring effect in the art's line work.  But the most glaring mistake is on the cutting of the cards, as it seems that the face and back of some are off centered in my deck.If you are not familiar with the Sharman-Caselli Tarot, this deck is based on the RWS Tarot, with inspiration from older decks such as the Tarot of Marseilles and the Visconti-Sforza.  Like the RWS Tarot, the imagery throughout the Sharman-Caselli Tarot depicts the renaissance era, but done with seemingly realistic art filled with soft colors.The Major Arcana is mostly inspired on the RWS Tarot, with a few exceptions.  The Wheel of Fortune shows a wheel with four people at the top, bottom and sides and a blind-folded women in its center, definitely drawing inspiration from the Visconti-Sforza Tarot, while The Lovers shows a finely dressed man deciding between two women with cupid floating over his head, an imagery more akin to the Marseilles Tarot.  The Minor Arcana are fully illustrated and inspired on the RWS Tarot.In a nod to the Visconti-Sforza tarot, the Major Arcana are unnumbered.  If you pay attention to the order of the Major Arcana you will find the following:  The Fool, The Magician, The Empress, The Emperor, The High Priestess, The Hierophant, The Lovers, The Chariot, Justice, Temperance, Strength, The Hermit, The Wheel of Fortune, The Hanged Man, Death, The Devil, The Tower, The Star, The Moon, The Sun, Judgement, and The World.  This is the order to study the Tarot recommended by Sharman-Burke.  This was included inThe New Complete Book of Tarot, but missing from the mini Tarot book included in this kit.The book in this kit is titled Tarot: Learn How To Read The Cards.  This is a small 3 x 3 inches pocket book, but at a count of 336 pages I doubt anyone would carry it in his/her pocket.  The book is divided as follows:What is Tarot?Getting to Know Your DeckThe Major ArcanaThe Minor ArcanaHow to Read the CardsYour first ReadingsTaking it FurtherIn all, this book is a larger version of a Little White Book.  You get a brief history of Tarot and then some.  To my surprise, there is even a description on how to play Trumps with the cards.  I never considered using a Tarot deck for playing games before, but at the smaller size, the cards are very well suited for playing.Three pages are spent for each card: one page for the image and ""Key Issues"", another for ""Symbolism"" and the last one for ""In A Reading"" use.  The final sections include layouts such as The Pyramid (5 cards), The Horseshoe (5 cards), and the Celtic Cross (10 cards).The silliest part of this kit is the 9 puzzle pieces Layout Board.  It includes The Pyramid in one side and The Horseshoe.  Honestly, with a few bucks, I think you could do better with a fold out plastic coated photocopy of well decorated layout of your own preference.This is not a bad kit to start with.  However, if your budget is tight or you are just testing the tarot waters, you may also considerTarot to Go!.  If you are a tarot collector or reader, you may want to spend just a bit more and buyThe Sharman-Caselli Tarot Deckinstead, but beware that the card stock on this deck is of a slightly inferior quality than decks from Us Games Inc, Llewellyn or even LoScarabeo.",4.0,A mini Sharman-Caselli Tarot,1365724800,"04 12, 2013",Toys_and_Games,1.0

Many of the pieces are similarly shaped, which adds to the difficulty, but, really, only the correct piece fits properly into place (giving you that subtle snap that lets you know you have the right piece in the right place).

I would say that it took me, alone, about 12-15 hours to complete the puzzle. The pieces are thick, but small, and do not fit together very well. The picture side is finished in a nice matte so that it is easy to see the color on the pieces from any angle. Compared to White Mountain Puzzles and Ravensburger, I am not impressed with Pomegranate. While I do like the matte finish quite a bit, I don't like the size and shape of the pieces and the overall size of the puzzle. I would buy from Pomegranate again if I found a puzzle that I really liked and if it was also a non-standard shape.Pros:- colors are true to the picture- matte finish on colored side makes it easy to pick out pieces without having to be straight above them- panorama shape makes for an interesting and different shape particularly if you hang your puzzlesCons:- I didn't like the picture as much once I got to see all the detail- pieces are small and make a small overall puzzle- pieces are standard shape which make putting it together boring AND, most importantly, pieces can be put in the wrong placeI will try to add a picture of my finished puzzle.",3.0,"Small for 1,000 piece puzzle",1345161600,"08 17, 2012",Toys_and_Games,0.0

The makers of the puzzle did their best to keep the shapes of the continents, countries, states, provinces, seas, etc. so of course there will be some really odd shaped pieces and even a lot of flat-sided pieces within the puzzle. Once it's all together though it stays put nicely, however in the mean time it might be a little frustrating for smaller fingers. A suggestion for this problem is to simply put the puzzle together on a non-slip surface ... and also if you have a smaller child it would be best to do it as a family. We have only put it together once but did so on our dining room table (oak ... slippery). Hindsight says a piece of felt or rubber or something similar placed UNDER the puzzle would have made the job a lot easier.Now the positive: This was a fun family project and all of my children are 16 or older. We all learned a lot about world geography ... I found myself saying &#34;it's probably in Africa&#34; quite a bit!!! Even with a large world map on the wall in our dining room I realized how I never really thought about how many countries are actually IN Africa but now I know. I now see that large world map a lot differently and we all look forward to assembling the puzzle again.Another positive is that I believe it was a very fair price for the product.Neutral thoughts: Before I got the puzzle I was wondering what it would look like. I wondered if each state in the US would have its own piece? No, they do not. Some of states, provinces, countries, etc. do SHARE a piece and the pieces are not EXACTLY the shape of the state, province, country, etc. This did not take away from the learning experience though.Highly recommended!",4.0,We enjoyed this puzzle a lot!,1400889600,"05 24, 2014",Toys_and_Games,1.0

The number of commons has fallen to 12 but they continue to make up 1/2 of a box.

There are 60 different figures in this set.  These are the first ""huge packs,"" so each booster comes with seven durable, pre-painted figures (including one rare OR one very rare figure), one of which will be a large OR very large figure.The first thing I look for in any expansion set are how many characters I recognize from the movies (vs. those that appeared only in the books).  I am particularly interested in figures from the original trilogy, and am happy to say there are at lest 22 figures from the original trilogy in this set.  Most are simply more powerful versions of earlier figures (for example, Lando Calrissian Rebel Hero, Darth Vader Jedi Hunter, Admiral Ackbar, Chewbacca Rebel Hero, Han Solo Rebel Hero, Luke Skywalker on Tauntaun, Princess Leia Rebel Hero, and Luke Skywalker, Jedi Master), but some have never been released before (for example, B'omarr Monk, Lobot, Nien Nunb, Wedge Antilles, and Rancor).  Notably, there are even a couple of great new common and uncommon figures from the original trilogy in this set (for example, Gonk Power Droid and especially the Stormtrooper Commander).Further, though I am not a big fan of the prequel, there are several figures from these movies as well (say 5-10 - though none of them stood out as particularly amazing/useful).  The rest are either from the books (including some that are very powerful), or generic/minor characters that I have never seen or heard of before (some of which are also pretty good and may be particularly useful in the Star Wars RPG).In sum (and as of the time this review was written), this is perhaps the second best expansion set for those interested in the original trilogy since Rebel Storm was first released in 2004 (with the Bounty Hunters expansion set being the best in this regard).  Those who like the Star Wars minis game and those who use the figures for the Star Wars RPG will likely be very happy with this set.ADDENDUM: (Please note that I include this addendum at the end of all my Star Wars minis reviews, so if you've read it before, there is no need to read it again.)  If you want to play the Star Wars minis game as it was designed to be played, it is best to have at least one starter (each starter comes with game instructions, a map, a D20, terrain tiles that are very helpful and add great variety to the game, and more).  I like the Rebel Storm Starter the best because it's from the classic era/trilogy, but the Clone Strike and Revenge of the Sith starters from the newer movies will also work.  If you don't want to invest in a starter, you can also get one of the three ""Ultimate Missions"" books, as each comes with a double sided map and a few smaller terrain tiles (again, I like the Rebel Strom Ultimate Missions book the best because it is also from the classic era/trilogy).  Or, you can buy the ""Attack on Endor"" scenario pack, which comes with TWO double sided maps (in addition to a scaled AT-ST that is fully usable in play).  The main point here is that you'll need some type of map/grid.  If you don't want to buy a Star Wars one, generic ones are also available at most gaming stores (you can use your imagination to set the scene, or draw terrain with an erasable marker right on the grid).  Of course, the minis are also useful for the roleplaying game (RPG) - in which case you may not need a starter or map, but will likely need the ""Core Rulebook"" instead.

You get a 12 miniature figures of Heroes, Monsters and a cool Blue Dragon. 4 booklets for each Hero and a basic Dungeon Master booklet, dice, dungeon tiles, 1 sheet of counters - doors, chests etc. made of glossy cardboard, a getting started 1pg sheet and an Advanced Rule book. This being my 1st D&D; game I think it has everything to get you started and if you like it you will have a good foundation to move on to other versions of the game. I also bought this game:Dungeons & Dragons Roleplaying Game Starter Set (D&D; Introductory Game), which is similar except it starts on the new version D&D; 4 and has cardboard discs instead of the minitures. I have been reading through each set and I think for the price I got much more than I expected, and look forward to get on with playing them. I think I picked a great starting point for the game and recommend anyone interested in D&D; to get this set!

Roll some dice. Have fun.Dnd is a hobby that requires a lot of dedication and the purchase of at least three rulebooks at around $30 apiece. Many new players/DMs will not know if they like Dnd enough to purchase the books they need, and this product is a great jumping-on point. It clearly outlines most of the basic rules. The key word there, however, is ""basic."" The characters that come with this set do not follow many of the rules presented in the Player's Handbook (for example, skill ranks that are absurdly high) and as such, confusion can be caused when the standard rules are incorporated. The six adventures in this book make up a small but high-quality mini campaign, and your players (I speak as a DM) will be hooked. For the best experience:1. Purchase the core rulebooks (Player Handbook, Dungeon Master's Guide, and Monster Manual) along with this set. Use the miniatures, adventures, and treasure/experience included in this boxed set, but use the standard rules for rolling up (creating) characters and for leveling up that are detailed in the Player Handbook.2. Take the time to fill out character sheets and you will be rewarded. They provides spaces, blanks, and boxes for just about every variable in Dnd, and it's very hard to stay organized without one.3. LEARN THE RULES. This is the absolute most important point. Yu don't need to learn about sundering weapons, grappling, bullrushing, and other advanced tactics until you're experienced, but basic rules like skill/ability checks and combat rolls are a must.Pretty good value for the money, BTW.REMEMBER: THIS IS THE 3.5 EDITION OF DND.

There is only one ten-sided die, not two. The actual game box lists the correct components.I think the components are well worth the money. You get a nice set of miniatures (including a dragon), some colorful map tiles, and a few basic dice. The rules booklets are a different approach, and I think an improvement, from the previous versions' use of character sheets. Each player gets their own character information, plus the basic rules, in one booklet. The Dungeon Master gets a booklet for the first adventures and uses the Advanced booklet after that.This game will most likely be reviewed in comparison with its predecessors, the earlier D&D; Basic Game and the D&D; Adventure Game. In comparison to the earlier Basic Game, this set has, on the con side, four fewer miniatures and less interesting-looking dice. On the pro side this set has booklets with more information for each player than just character sheets, character sheets for level 2 in the Advanced Rulebook, and a bigger, bluer dragon.On the true neutral side, the adventures in this set are presented as a series of one-shot excursions, between which the characters return to town. I haven't played them yet, but I'm guessing this will give players the chance to learn more incremently, take breaks, and talk about what just happened in a different way than with the previous set, which had one, long dungeon. But, even the previous set advised a return to town before encountering the final monster.Given the quality of components in the Adventure Game, which has a glossy paper map and counters instead of miniatures, and originally sold for just under US$10, this current set is a bargain at the current price.I like the Adventure Game and I like both versions of the Basic Game. I do not see the Basic Game 2006 as an improvement or enhancement of either of these sets, but simply a different approach. Although you get fewer miniatures and dice without flash, you do get another way to learn the rules. The change from character sheets to booklets, the inclusion of level 2 character sheets, and the separation of the game play into shorter adventures leading to a final, longer adventure are the major changes I see in this latest set. All of these changes give new players a slightly different way to learn the game.As I am interested in games as learning tools, and love to see games whose creators seem to care about making the learning process easier, I thought this Basic Set's focus on changing the pacing of the first adventures and the amount of information given to players was worth the purchase in itself. And, now, my black dragon has someone to fight.For slightly fewer components and an interesting, new approach to learning the game, I give the Basic Game 2006 four stars.Happy gaming.",4.0,"Comparisons are odious, but inevitable",1159401600,"09 28, 2006",Toys_and_Games,1.0

The rules are pretty simple, as other reviewers have noted, but this helps to avoid ambiguity and prevent loopholes that could lead to game-breaking situations.  Instead, the way that you deploy your fleet, choose to order and target your attacks, and how you use your command options really determines the flow of a game.  After every game, I can usually point to the critical moment when my strategy either succeeded or failed because of a set of lynchpin moves.  That's how a game should be.

However, since I didn't know where most buyers would start, I figured it was best to provide the review under both the boosters and the starters to be safe. That said...I'm a big fan of Star Wars minis (especially Rebel Storm), and I couldn't wait to get my starter and boosters for the new Star Wars Starship Battles minis game. The game/set includes 60 different ships (30 ""light side"" and 30 ""dark side"" -- approximately 1/2 are from the original trilogy, and the other half are from the prequel). I have to admit, the ships look pretty cool (especially the smaller ones like the Millennium Falcon, Salve 1, TIE Fighters, TIE Interceptor, TIE Bomber, B-Wings, X-Wings, Y-Wings, etc.), and as I first read the instructions and looked at the ship stats cards, I was looking very forward to playing. In the end (after playing several games with a friend), however, I was largely disappointed with the game itself. Though there are a few interesting twists (like the command effects),the game is pretty basic, and unfortunately does not allow much room for strategy and/or creativity.The best advice I can give you is to begin with the starter set, which comes with everything you'll need to play (including two exclusive rare ships -- the big guns in the set, eight randomized common and uncommon ships, map, instructions, command cards, damage counters, D20, etc.). You MIGHT also want to buy a couple of boosters (each booster includes seven randomized ships -- one rare, two uncommon, and four common). This way your buy-in isn't too bad; otherwise, it can get very expensive very quickly. You'll definitely get at least a few good games out of it, and if you like the game more than I did, you can easily buy more boosters (that is much better than the alternative of buying a ton of boosters and not being very happy with the game). Also, if you are interested the minis themselves (i.e., to collect them, for use with the D20 role playing game, or to use with some other Star Wars game/scenario), you'll probably be mostly happy with what Wizards of the Coast came up with.In sum, the game/rules gets 3 stars, and the minis get 4-5 stars (rounded up to a 4 star rating overall).

This is different in that the ships have ranged attacks and you roll a 20-sided die to determine hit/miss.  Each ship has a stat card that gives the defensive value that you're rolling against, the attack bonus that you add to the roll, and the damage inflicted if you hit.The biggest gripe people are going to have about this game (and others like it) is that it's 'collectible' - other than the 2 extra-large ships in the starter, what you get is random... so you could potentially spend hundreds to get the pieces that you want.  Games like these tend to lean towards 'spend more to win more'.  Otherwise, there's a certain thrill to the uncertainty.If you've played a mini-based game before, there's no big surprises here.  This one's a bit more expensive than many others - owing in part to being out of print.  The mini's are fairly nice, and the soft rubber/plastic seems like it would be hard to actually break, but I've seen several permanently bent/saggy pieces - despite some pretty good packaging; maybe stored in too warm temperatures?  I think you need a couple of boosters to really fill out a fleet - the starter comes with the 2 extra-large ships and 8 random medium/small ships; each booster has 1 large ship and 6 medium/small ships.  It plays very quickly; you can easily finish a game in 20-30 minutes - it's almost too short actually.

Cutler ""DM for 30+ years""","[7, 10]","This ""miniature"" is one of the biggest ever that is still to scale with the standard D&D; sized minis. The construction is well-done, as is the paintjob, and it depicts a truly massive red dragon quasi-rearing up as if to strike downward or to breathe a gout of flame (more on that in a moment).I've already had the chance to pull this big boy out and use it in game (a PC shapechanged into a colossal red dragon), and it is quite impressive when actually placed on a battle mat and set against other figures. The weirdest thing is that it makes the gargantuan black dragon, which, when I first got it, seemed immense, now look positively puny!Those are the good points of the mini. But there are two bad points. The first is important IMO. For reasons I cannot quite understand, they made the mini the wrong size. Yep. A colossal red dragon is supposed to be 30 ft square. This one is 40 ft square. Now, as some have pointed out, the definition of colossal in the Monster Manual says colossal creatures are AT LEAST 30 ft square, but can be bigger. But the red dragon entry in the Monster Manual only lists 30 ft square as the proper size of a colossal red dragon.Can I, as a DM, rationalize an extra 10 ft? Yeah. But it is still an annoying thing...and sometimes even more. As a DM I might have designed a cavern or dungeon to fit a colossal red dragon and made the halls 30 ft wide. Oops! Now my red dragon mini doesn't even fit in my dungeon! It also distorts the reach of the dragon. A 30 ft square dragon with reach threatens many fewer squares than a 40 ft square dragon with reach. This can make a large difference in combat.But really, the increase simply seems unecessary. Why did WOTC make it bigger than the proper size? What compelling reason was there to do this? None that I can think of.Devin",4.0,The biggest of them all,1163030400,"11 9, 2006",Toys_and_Games,1.0

However, since I didn't know where most buyers would start, I figured it was best to provide the review under both the boosters and the starters to be safe.  That said...I'm a big fan of Star Wars minis (especially Rebel Storm), and I couldn't wait to get my starter and boosters for the new Star Wars Starship Battles minis game.  Each booster comes with seven random ships (including one rare ship and one large ship). The game/set includes 60 different ships (30 ""light side"" and 30 ""dark side"" -- approximately 1/2 are from the original trilogy, and the other half are from the prequel).  I have to admit, the ships look pretty cool (especially the smaller ones like the Millennium Falcon, Salve 1, TIE Fighters, TIE Interceptor, TIE Bomber, B-Wings, X-Wings, Y-Wings, etc.), and as I first read the instructions and looked at the ship stats cards, I was looking very forward to playing.  In the end (after playing several games with a friend), however, I was largely disappointed with the game itself.  Though there are a few interesting twists (like the command effects),the game is pretty basic, and unfortunately does not allow much room for strategy and/or creativity.The best advice I can give you is to begin with the starter set, which comes with everything you'll need to play (including two exclusive rare ships -- the big guns in the set, eight randomized common and uncommon ships, map, instructions, command cards, damage counters, D20, etc.).  You MIGHT also want to buy a couple of boosters (each booster includes seven randomized ships -- one rare, two uncommon, and four common).  This way your buy-in isn't too bad; otherwise, it can get very expensive very quickly.  You'll definitely get at least a few good games out of it, and if you like the game more than I did, you can easily buy more boosters (that is much better than the alternative of buying a ton of boosters and not being very happy with the game).  Also, if you are interested the minis themselves (i.e., to collect them, for use with the D20 role playing game, or to use with some other Star Wars game/scenario), you'll probably be mostly happy with what Wizards of the Coast came up with.In sum, the game/rules gets 3 stars, and the minis get 4-5 stars (rounded up to a 4 star rating overall).

Writing from memory...the CRD can move, bite, claw, breathe, move and claw, tail sweep, crush, or something like that.  For each 100 hp the CRD loses it loses one activation.

Recently I have started gaming again, and was planning to be a DM for the first time in many years.  FYI, Average price I have seen this is about $150.00 currently as of 4/2010.  Ebay only that is, most retail sites that have it, are charging upwards of $200.00 and I was lucky enough to purchase it online in mint condition for $157.00 shipped.  I would pay up to $200.00 to have it, now that I have actually held it in my hands.  Do in fact have two of these.  One in the box and the other displayed in my computer room.About the Dragon.  It is immense and awe inspiring when compared with any of the miniatures that are out there.  I have all the dragons now, Gargantuan Black, Blue & White (Icingdeath from Drizzt set) and combined they are still dwarfed by the Red.  When standing next to a half-orc paladin, the paladin is no bigger than one of it's talons.  Someone had mentioned that the detail on the black and Blue were a bit more detailed than the red but considering it's sheer size, the detail seems accurate, as scales would be that big and have the ""shadows"" that are created by what appears to be poor painting.  I find the facial details as well as the tail and wings to be well done.The flame cone that is included, is interesting and along the lines of the fire elemental miniatures, which personally I did not like.  (Creating fire as an inanimate miniature will fail every time, just a fact as of right now.) It has a nice effect but is limited to staying directly in front of the dragon and must be attached at both the mouth, in an awkward location and the base of the miniature.  If it was possible to be attached by just the mouth and be directional, that would have been really amazing.The pose, I think that it could have been better than a simple claw swiping down.  Because of it's size, I think it should have not been on it's haunches but standing tall, with wings outstretched, tail swinging about and maybe it's claws, one downward, the other to the side or poised to strike out.  Since these were one of-a-kind designs, I felt that they should have been more animated because we know that a new one is unlikely.  Perhaps they will consider that for next time.  I still would like to see an ancient Green, Black or White and considering it is still Dungeons and Dragons, you would think that Dragon miniatures would be plentiful and in many variations!Pros:SizeIntimidation factorGreat detail in its overall designCollossal Red Dragon more than 12 inches tall!Cons:Cost at $200 and up, it might be out of reach for some people, to remind you I got it for under $200.Not as imaginative as it could have been in its poseSize - not many would want this, even for a major campaign to be on the table.Dragon breath can only be used in one spotGreat price when it came out, too much as of this writing, so if you have the money and plan to use it even once, then it should be acquired as soon as you can.  Details, size and the fact it is a colossal sized anything in Dungeons and Dragons, let alone an Ancient Red Dragon, are one of the many reasons to have this in your collection.",5.0,Collossal Red Dragon-DM & player's thoughts...,1272412800,"04 28, 2010",Toys_and_Games,1.0

It retails for [...] (and make sure you're getting the free miniatures), but Amazon sells it for [...].D&D; Player's Handbook, softcover: I'm happy with it. The binding and paper quality are better than most d20 softcovers I own and, like the hardcover, it's in color. The cover looks the same as the PHB, and, from a distance, even looks like the hardcover.Premium dice: The dice set are four 6-sided dice, one of each of 4-, 8-, 12- and 20-sided dice, and two 10-sided dice (percentile dice). (One of the ten-sided dice has the tens digit, and is rolled with the normal 10-sided dice.) The dice are a mixed color of black and another color, with the numbers outlined in gold. Unfortunately, my dice had far too much black, giving the dice a black, mottled look. It shouldn't be too hard to find better dice at the local game store. Nonetheless, these dice are a definite improvement over the blandly colored dice in the Basic Set. (You'll have to get your own Royal Crown dice bag, though!)Character sheet: Only one character sheet is provided, as a master sheet to make copies from. The sheet is cardstock and durable. (You can also download this sheet from the [...] website.) I would have liked to have at least five or a pad of sheets instead of one.Quick Start booklets: These 8-page color booklets are quick start rules for character generation, simplified quick-start rules, and a short solo adventure (a ""choose your own adventure"" with some NPC interaction and three monster encounters). The Basic D&D; set is obviously a better starting point to learn D&D;, but these booklets might be useful to give new players an overview of the game.Eight Free Miniatures: As these are random, your satisfaction will vary. (For those who play the D&D; Miniatures game, this is an OOP Aberrations booster.) Myself, I received three miniatures which could be used as PC's (elf archer; gnome thief, which could be used as a halfling thief; and human with shield and flail; no spellcasters), two usable monsters (an orc and a mongrelman, who could pass for a goblin), and three exotic monsters (a cool Cthulhu-like Mind Flayer, a one-eyed spider thing, and an overweight grey guy in armor with an ice cream cone sticking out of his forehead). The paint jobs are quite good (more detailed than HeroScape), though on the small side.The Box: Yes, the box counts. Your first impression will be that it's far too big for a book -- and you're right. The box is the same size as the D&D; Basic Set, so my guess is that it's a standard size from the printer WotC uses, so is cheaper than a smaller box. Of course, it's useful to store your D&D; stuff.With the free booster and low online price, this is no-brainer for anyone shopping for a PHB, who doesn't mind a softcover.

First, you know exactly what six figures you are getting (Obi-Wan Kenobi, Rebel Captain, Rebel Heavy Trooper, Darth Vader, Elite Stormtrooper, and Heavy Stormtrooper).  And, while I would rather have had some new figures to play with, I very much appreciate the fact that you know exactly what you are getting up front.  Further, if you happen to need one or more of these figures/maps, it's definitely worth buying this starter.  Second, the Obi-Wan Kenobi figure was originally a very rare figure from the Rebel Storm set, and the Darth Vader figure was originally a very rare figure from the Revenge of the Sith set.  Thus, until now these figures were harder to get and therefore fairly expensive.  But, now you can get them both for one low price.  Third, though one side of the map was previously released in the Revenge of the Sith Ultimate Missions book (the ""Chancellor's Starship/Thrown Room Map"" map), the other one was previously released only as a promo (the ""Korriban - Valley of the Dark Lords"" map).  So while previously available, most people will likely not have one or both of these maps.  Finally, the set includes a D20, latest rule book, and force/damage counters, so if this is the very first Star Wars minis item you are purchasing, you will still be able to have a fairly fun game right out of the box.In sum, if you already have the figures and maps listed above, you will not need to buy this starter set.

This starter set comes with six figures (more information on the figures is presented below). You can also buy the Clone Wars boosters to add significant variety to the game (there are 40 additional figures in the Clone Wars minis set - and this is the 11th booster set for the Star Wars minis game). I'll try to write more about the Clone Wars boosters in a separate review, but the rest of this review focuses on the four key reasons why I gave this starter set five stars.First, each starter set comes with the same six fixed figures, including three light side figures (General Obi-Wan Kenobi, Clone Trooper Commander, and Clone Trooper), and three dark side figures (Count Dooku of Serenno, Security Battle Droid, and Super Battle Droid Commander). The Obi-Wan and Dooku figures are exclusive to the starter set (which means you can't get them anywhere else). Both of these exclusive figures have amazing stats, special abilities, and force powers (and Obi-Wan also has a super commander effect), so they are definitely worth adding to your collection. And, while the other four figures are available in previous sets, I very much appreciate the fact that you know exactly what you are getting up front. IMPORTANT NOTE: There is a misprint in the Rule Book Glossary re: Obi-Wan's card. Soresue Style Mastery says ""When hit by an attack...,"" on the card, but in the glossary it says ""When hit by a MELEE attack..."" The most recent official ruling is that the card is correct (this has been confirmed by the game's creator, so feel free to check out their web page for the latest Errata).Second, and perhaps just as importantly, this set includes two great new maps (""Christophis"" on one side, and ""Freight Transit Station"" on the other side). To me, these two new maps alone are worth the entire price of the starter set (i.e., since the map you pick and play on can influence the game as much as the figures you chose to play with -- and both of these maps are very melee figure friendly). At the time this review was written there was no other way to get these maps except to purchase this starter set.Third, the starter set also contains a book with the quick start and advanced rules (and both are very easy to understand). Further, the Glossary at the end contains the latest definitions for all key words, special abilities, and force powers for every set released up to this point (i.e., the only place all of this information is located in one convenient location).Fourth, the set also includes a D20, force/damage counters, and pretty much everything you'll need to play. So, if this is the very first Star Wars minis item you are purchasing, you will still be able to have a fun game right out of the box.In sum, I think most experienced players will want to purchase this starter set for the exclusive figures and the two maps.

I've played the A&A board games and thought this would be similar. Despite the major difference in playing style, I quite enjoyed the miniatures. This particular set was like a teaser, it got me interested in buying more. However, it's not a very balanced set. First off it comes with 4 tanks, 3 of which are allied tanks and 1 is axis. It comes with 6 infantry soldiers, three on each side. The allies have a commander so the M1 Garand troop gets bonuses and the allied side gets an initiative bonus. On the other side the Germans have an MG 42 unit with the double shot ability and a high kill ratio vs. infantry, so the infantry is balanced.  However, each allied tank could overpower the axis tank individually.  The axis tank is a Panzer III Ausf. F which has lower armor and a low cost.  All of the allied tanks are almost twice the Panzer's cost and have more armor/fire power. Out of all the scenarios I have run with this set the Germans have only won once due to a lucky roll by the axis Panzerfaust 30 unit taking out the American Sherman early on in the match.  Overall, the set is rather nice. It's a good way to add some troops and armor into your ranks. It's also a good way to obtain the rare British Cromwell tank and the uncommon Russian T-34/76 tank.

Each unit has a different point value, and with the expansion packs there is nearly an endless combination of possibilities. The starter set contains mostly German and U.S. units, but the expansion packs contain nearly every nationality that participated in WWII.After creating an army, players place their units on the fold out game map.  From there, players roll dice to see who has the initiative for the turn.  Based on that, one player moves first followed by the second player.  After both players have moved, the assault phase begins and players attack each other based on their units attributes.  Finally the results of the assault phase are dealt out in the casualty phase.  That concludes one turn, the game last for 7 turns and the player who holds the objective is the winner.  So far games last about an hour and a half for us, but will probably move more quickly once we can remember most of the rules and don't need to consult the rule book as often.RulesThe rules aren't as complex as some other miniature games, so its pretty quick to learn and keeps the game from bogging down.  But it has enough detail in the rules to keep everything interesting and does a fairly accurate job of simulating WWII tactical combat, as compared to other games.ProsThe game is a lot of fun. I enjoy miniature games and this is one of the better ones I've played.  The miniatures are very detailed and exciting.  The variety of units is nice, because every game is different.  There many types of units available with booster packs that make the for lots of Army combinations.ConsThe fold out game maps tend to scrunch up a bit, and they don't want to lay completely flat.The game only included 8 dice.  Some units need to roll more than that.Its unbalanced, the starter set comes with 4 Axis units (31 points total) and 6 Allied units (86 points total).  Since the game rules recommend to play with armies of 100 points, it's a good idea to get two or three expansion packs right away to help balance the game and make things more interesting.For the realist, the infantry are 15mm scale and the vehicles are 20mm scale.  In the later expansion packs the vehicles were reduced to 15mm scale to match the infantry.  Not a big deal, but it looks weird when the starter pack M4A1 Sherman is the same size as much larger tanks.SummaryOverall, its a very fun and exciting game.  I highly recommend it, though adding more expansion packs makes it even more fun.",5.0,"Awesome game, lots of fun!",1372377600,"06 28, 2013",Toys_and_Games,1.0

Miller,"[34, 34]","Although I didn't purchase this from Amazon, I do own the product.Pros:- Nice looking pre-painted 15mm miniatures- Quick setup- Easy to learn- Games can be played in 60 minutes or less- Many free downloadable maps and scenarios both from Avalon Hill and the user community- Expandable via map and booster packs so game play never gets staleCons:- The starter set includes more Allied pieces than Axis, giving the Allies a significant advantage- Most of the downloadable scenarios cannot be played with just the starter pack units- Booster packs are expensive for the number of units you get ($11 to $15 dollars for five miniatures)Being new to Axis & Allies, this seemed like it would be great little game and I am not disappointed. Whereas the board games are more strategic, this is more tactical which I like. In addition, games can be played in around 60 minutes as opposed to 2 to 5 hours for some Axis & Allies board games. It comes with 10 detailed 15mm miniatures, each having a corresponding card that shows its cost, year available, defense, speed, weapons range and any special abilities it may have as well as a little trivia about the unit. The starter pack comes with the following miniatures:Axis:- German Panzer III Ausf. F (Tank)- German MG 42 machine-gun team (Soldier)- German PanzerFaust 30 (Soldier, anti-tank)- German Mauser Kar 98k (Soldier, rifle)Allies:- British Cromwell IV (Tank)- Russian T34/76 (Tank)- U.S. M4A1 Sherman (Tank)- U.S. ""Red Devil"" Captain (Soldier)- U.S. Bazooka (Soldier anti-tank)- U.S. M1 Garand Rifle (Soldier)Also included in the box are:RulebookQuick start guideEight dice (six sided)Damage countersTwo double-sided maps that may be used separately, or be combined to form six different configurationsThe starter pack does not come with any scenarios probably due to the limited number of units. The rulebook simply recommends you setup some skirmishes using the units included in the box. This will help you learn the rules and flow of the game. There are a ton of downloadable maps and scenarios from the Wizards of the Coast website ([...]) but most I have looked at require more units than the ones included in the starter pack and this is where the game can get expensive. To get the most out of this game (as in any collectible miniature or card game) you need to purchase booster packs. You can buy booster packs from eight different sets, each set containing from 48 to 60+ miniatures. Each booster pack contains five random miniatures from that set. At about $11 - $15 a pop, you can see how this would add up quickly. The good news is that there are websites out there that sell the individual units from each set. Although some of the rare units can be upwards of $10 to $11 apiece.Overall Axis & Allies Miniatures is a fun game to play if you like unit level tactical combat. As long as you are prepared to make about a $50 to $60 investment beyond the starter pack price, you can have a game of almost infinite re-playability with collectible miniatures to boot. As you purchase more miniatures and map pack expansions, the game just gets richer, more varied and more fun.",4.0,A fun collectible miniatures war game,1281052800,"08 6, 2010",Toys_and_Games,1.0

Games usually take from 45 minutes to an hour, but I have had games last ten minutes and two hours.  It seems that the more players, the longer the game takes, kind of like inMunchkin.For those of you not in the boardgame community, a ""beer and pretzels"" game is a fun rules-light game that you can play while socializing or sitting in a pub.  Inn-Fighting excels at this description, and the flavor of the game makes it perfect to take with you to a local pub.You will need plenty of counters, I'd say around 25 per player should be enough.  I bought 150 blue glass counters and a dice bag in which to hold them at a local gaming shop.  I would complain about the counters not being included if the price was $25, but for $15 it's not a problem and most gamers have a lot of counters anyway.I liked Three Dragon Ante as well, but feel rules are too structured for what is supposed to be a fantasy card gambling game that you can also play in-character.  I can never get my friends to play 3DA, but I have no problem getting them to play Inn-Fighting with me.  Inn-Fighting is not designed to be played in-character, but it is a great game to play when waiting for a late arrival to your RPG game or for postgame.Overall it's a pretty good game that is recommended if you're into D&D; or fantasy in general.  Another good ""drinking game"" game with great mechanics isRed Dragon Inn, but it doesn't have as much replay value.Since Amazon is not currently offering a discount on this game, I recommend purchasing it from a friendly local game shop(FLGS) instead of Amazon.  These shops offer places to hang out and play games, and many have gone out of business by the e-commerce boom.

One of the best things about the game is it's very luck-based so depending on your roll, and the cards you may or may not receive based on the dice, you can go from being on top to the very bottom in a single turn. I've seen people come from behind - at about ten ""VP"" or victory points and win the game in a single round having made a good use of a card and taken out an adventurer.The game was originally designed to be used during a D&D; (Dungeons and Dragons) game the make a tavern brawl a little more fun and interesting, but having played D&D; for years, they can be interesting and tactically-challenging enough without adding a 1-hour card/dice game into the mix.  The game can go very quickly or very slow all depending on the dice and how the players implement their cards.One thing to note is that inside the box, there's a card that says to go to Wizards website to create your own characters and apparently this IS NOT an option. The site's page doesn't exist, nor from my research has ever existed.  I created my own template by scanning a card at 600dpi and implementing my Photoshop skills, and I'll probably upload the template to Boardgamegeek at some point in the near future.  It's fun using characters you've made for Dungeons and Dragons in the game and creating a skillset that make sense for them as a character for this little game, but is not necessary at all. The characters included in the game are all fun to use.I play this regularly with the family and we have two kids, ages 7 and 6 and they have a fun time as well. Keep in mind that the artwork is a bit sexy since the regular audience for D&D; is males ages 10-30, but there's nothing overtly offensive.

Wizards of the Coast (WotC) has decided that they are going to be making less random (non-random and semi-random) packs in the future, and while they will contain cards for the 4th edition role-playing game, they will not be making any new cards for the DDM Skirmish game. However, this aside, they are still going to be revising all of the older sets to 2.0 rules, which is nice, but at this point you don't really want to be new to the game (unless you have a group who likes to play casually) because there will be no more support what so ever after Feburary when D&D; Experience ends.Taking that as you will, the product is amazing in almost every way compared to the last two DDM 2.0 sets (Against the Giants and Dungeons of Dread). While the paint jobs and sculps, overall, have not gotten any better, there are some very nice looking and inspiring models. There are 3 ""true"" dragons in this set, all of which are very attrative and quite usable in the DDM game and in the 4th ed game: The Iron Dragon Prowler, the Black Dragon Lurker, and (my favorite) the Stormrage Blue Dragon. There are two more Dragonborn, which is great for people who want to play in the RPG as a Dragonborn, but they are still both rares (which is bad for people who want to play a dragonborn in the RPG). Sadly, this set has a host of reprints, all of which are very unnessicary: A bearded devil, many more drow, a draegloth, a stirge, a dire bear, and the list goes on and on. I believe that this may have been one of the major causes of the downfall of the DDM line because, really, who needs more and more drow, more and more bears, and so on?As far as the game and its rules go, this set goes on to clarify the ""Dominated"" ability and to fix its game balance. Also, the almost undesputed weakest faction, Underdark, gets a massive boost, making it finally competative with the other factions' warbands that hit GenCon this year. Pieces that are of note for their playability are the Thoon Hulk (WOW!), the Stirge, the Soulrider Devil, and the Black Dragon Lurker. Many others in the set help out Underdark a lot, I've not gotten to use enough of the set to tell you all of the good pieces.Its very sad, because overall, this set is simply amazing. It rebalances the game (in my humble opinion), has unique models (though, as has been the trend, their sculpts and pain jobs are horrible compared to previous sets) and the themes and ideas of the DDM stats are all really fresh and interesting.

This is a wonderful, mind working game.Many people liked the version with the 3-d peices because they don't get bumped... but if you play on a table and aren't trying to hold a baby at the same time or have a cat that likes to jump on games (which are valid concerns), then this version will do fine. I'm not really certain why some people keep buying each version, unless they collect or their old one is worn out from many a good time.I personally have been waiting for a ""flat""version. I found that the 3-d version was unnecessarily bulky (they could have made a better ""locking system"" if they wanted a bump free version), the pieces were too big to throw into a drawstring bag and draw from (I'd rather not have to turn them all upside down and then make room for all the bulky upside down pieces to take up half my table), and the peices were too bulky to easily conceal from the other players.. we had to all get shoe boxes, or keep them upside down and remember exactly which pieces we had.So all and all, I actually prefer this one. You will have a distinct advantage if you have the type of mind that can keep track of how many of what each player buys.Not the best to play with young players because decisions they make can effect everyone else... which is good if they fully understand why they are doing it and what effect it will have, but if they don't, then it really is a bummer when they mess things up for you (and it doesn't even help them).",5.0,I didn't like the 3d version anyway,1227398400,"11 23, 2008",Toys_and_Games,1.0

If you haven't tried partnership Acquire, give it a try, it's a whole different game.For those not familiar with the game, there are tiles that are placed on the game board. When two or more are joined, they form a hotel chain. Only 6 hotel chains can exist on the board at a time, so certain tiles can become unplayable for a period of time. When a tile is played that connects two hotels, they are merged with the longer chain taking over the smaller. If they are the same size, the person playing the merging tile determines which chain takes over.The subtleties of the game make it one of the true gems of boardgames. Sid Sackson developed the original version about 50 years ago and hundreds, if not thousands, of games have been developed since that in same ways have employed some of the mechanics and strategic elements of this game. Each player has unique information about the future growth of the hotels and the upcoming mergers. They can each take advantage of this but of course, other players can observe what they do and infer what information they have...If you haven't played this game, you should definitely try it out.

I then picture him playing Tongo with a bunch of other Ferengi...a game that deals with buying, selling, acquiring, and other things you'd normally see on the Wall Street floor. Don't ask me why...I haven't had my coffee yet this morning.Acquire: 3-6 Players, Ages 12+, Average Play Time: 60 to 90 Minutes*Note: While the box says that the game is for three to six players, I don't see why a two player variant couldn't exist...if one doesn't already. I'm fairly confident that two players with an imagination who are not concerned about following the rulebook to the letter could make do. I also came across the older Avalon Hill version's rulebook and there is a section for special rules for two players...so feel free to experiment.Acquire plays a bit differently than the other games I've played. The closest comparison I could possibly make to what I've already reviewed is Airlines Europe. In both games, you're buying stock and whoever has more of certain stocks / colors often reaps the biggest reward when payouts occur. More on that in a minute.Version & ComponentsThe version of Acquire I purchased is the latest print of the game, by Wizards of the Coast.I need to get this pet peeve of mine out of the way before I begin. The player tile trays are made of fairly cheap cardboard that you have to punch out and bend to make the pieces assemble. In other words, I had a fun time trying to assemble the player tile trays. In most games I've purchased, tile trays came assembled and were of much better quality.Some people may not mind the extra work and the game is fairly cheaper than your average Euro-style board game, but c'mon...would it have hurt profits that much to just make the components a little better? Also, the player reference tables were part of the manual itself that I had to cut / tear out. For OCD people like me, the manual just doesn't look right now that pages look torn out of it. I don't see why they couldn't have printed reference sheets separate of the manual.Previous versions of the game were much nicer looking and of better quality, so much in fact that other reviewers recommend trying to find those older printed versions as opposed to this one. I don't mind average to poor production values if the price is right, but this is just pushing it.Game MechanicsThe game board is made of up of squares that form a grid, going from 1A in the upper left hand corner all the way to 12I in the lower right hand corner. To the left of the grid are the available corporations that players can form and to the right is the same reference chart you'll find in the cutouts in the back of the manual.In Acquire, turns are fairly simple. Players place a tile, players buy up to three stocks, and finally players pick up a new tile from the supply. Tiles correspond to the squares / grid on the board...for example...you'd place the 1A tile if you had it onto the 1A square on the board / grid.When a player places a tile next to an existing tile sitting by itself, that player gets to form a corporation. It doesn't become their's mind you, but they do get a free stock card for establishing it. That player can choose any of the available corporations...though some grow differently than others. Some corporations are cheap to buy stocks for early on but don't pay out as much when they grow in size while others are expensive to buy stocks for early on but payout is big in the endgame.Players continue placing tiles, forming / growing corporations, and buying stock cards until a tile is placed that causes two corporations to bump heads. This is the real meat and potatoes of the game. A few things happen when this occurs.1) The larger corporation acquires or ""eats up"" the smaller one. If the purple corporation for example had six tiles and green had three tiles, purple would acquire green. The exception to the rule is if both corporations are eleven tiles are higher in size. Corporations with eleven tiles or more are considered ""safe.""2) The player who owns the most stock cards in the company that was acquired gains the one time majority shareholder bonus. The amount varies depending on how big the corporation actually is. The player who owns the second most stock cards of the company that was acquired receives the one time minority shareholder bonus. Sorry, but there isn't a prize here for third place, unless there is a tie for second place.3) Players who own stock in the company that was acquired have a choice to make.- They can sell their stock for cash now, the amount depending on how big the corporation is.- They can trade that stock on a 2 to 1 basis for stock of the company that acquired it.- They can keep their stock, hoping the corporation will form again down the line.The acquired company marker gets put back to its place on the side of the board and can be formed again later on.At the end of the game, shareholder bonuses are given out to the companies that are on the board and their stocks are traded in for cash. The winner is the player with the most money after that is all said and done.The ReviewAll three kids joined me to form a four player game. Explaining the rules wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. I was concerned that the whole buying stocks and acquiring would overwhelm the eleven year old, but ironically he ended up winning the game. He randomly bought stock so that he'd try to have more than everyone else, which ended up working out to his advantage unbeknownst to him.I focused on buying stocks for two corporations in the middle of the board and would have made a lot of money had one acquired the other...but they ended up becoming ""safe"" and I didn't have much money left to buy stocks in other corporations that could still be acquired. I received a nice bonus at the end of the game for all the stock I had, but my son used the money he earned from his acquisitions to buy even more stock than what I had bought up cheaply in the beginning of the game...so he ended up getting the majority shareholder bonus anyway. He earned so much from a particular acquisition that he just started buying out ALL of the stock cards of particular colors until there were none left.It seems to pay to have money throughout the game and not to focus on one or two corporations, unless you are sure they will pay out. I was tempted to offer him a later bed time if he'd slip me ten grand, but I thought better of it. The game took us about two hours to play...keep in mind, there was a learning curve and three kids of varying ages involved.Overall, I really enjoyed the game. Acquire is simple enough to learn but deep enough that players can form strategies in order to outdo the other. The random tile placement throughout the game by players keeps the replayability high. I quickly forgot about the quality of the player tile trays when I started playing out scenarios in my head on how certain corporations might play out on the board.The kids were actively working out aloud which corporations they planned to grow and were constantly comparing how many stock cards they had of certain colors. They were often on the edge of their seats when a merger occured...anxious to see how it would play out. The older ones took it a step further and bought out stock in the growing corporations, recognizing how much money they could make when it grows even bigger. The younger one just bought what he could afford and random chance worked in his favor. They all stated that they enjoyed playing the game.I personally recommend Acquire if you enjoy games with a financial theme to them, in this case, stocks and money. I recommend that players have a calculator handy, especially for the endgame. The poor production values (when compared to versions previous to it) might turn some people off, but I'd recommend putting that aside in your mind to enjoy the game for what it really is.",4.0,Acquire Review by Dad's Gaming Addiction,1347235200,"09 10, 2012",Toys_and_Games,1.0

Finally, an economic game that is far better than monopoly could ever hope to be!  I know a lot of people who have owned older versions are upset at the quality of the components compared to earlier versions and rightly so, but really, the game just rocks!  Buy this cheaper version to play, and then go buy an older expensive version to store in your closet, so you can be an Acquire snob saying you have version 19xx something:-)Acquire is a game about investing in hotel chains and getting the most money in the end, similar to Monopoly, but that is about where the similarity ends.  The game does a wonderful job of creating the experience of investing in stock, simulating growth in value as the hotel chain grows, merging, and fighting to be primary stockholder for huge payouts on mergers.  The gameplay is brilliantly simple, but the strategy and decision making can go way deep!  It is done in such a way that the word elegance comes to mind. Even though there is luck involved in the way you draw tiles for this game, I at least get to choose where I want to move by placing a tile. Whereas in Monopoly, you have to move where the die tells you (roll 'n move) which aggravates me.In this game you perform 3 simple actions: place a tile, buy up to three stocks, and then draw another tile. When I place a tile, I can decide if I want help grow a hotel chain(don't have to own it), create a hotel chain, or merge a hotel chain.  After that, I have to decide on which hotel chain on the board I want to buy stock.  This is where things get interesting, because you know that if you own the most stock in a hotel chain that gets gobbled up in a merger, you'll get some major moolah.  Of course the bigger the chain is when it gets gobbled, the bigger the payout is. So, you may finding yourself trying to weigh out when you should merge the hotel chain if someone doesn't do it first and whether or not you grow it.  Again, there's a risk involved, because if a hotel chain gets beyond 11 tiles, it is safe from acquisition.  If that happens and you're a major stockholder, then you'll keep growing that ""safe"" hotel chain for the big payout at the end of the game.  When mergers happen, you also have to decide if you should trade your stock in for the new hotel, sell your old stock, or keep it for when you decide to start the old chain back up again.  The game has a lot of subtle strategy as you try to weigh out how you grow a hotel chain or merge it, based on how much stock you own in it or how much someone else has invested in it.Acquire is just a beautifully designed game and is a lot of fun to play.  This is a great way to teach your kids about investing in stock too!",4.0,"Really, no matter how it's made, it's a great game! Better than Monopoly!",1307923200,"06 13, 2011",Toys_and_Games,1.0

I have collected versions of Acquire from 1st release to present release. I guess I'm a collector as well as an avid player. I have to say though that the latest version of the game has much to be desired in terms of quality. The game hasn't changed so for new players that are interested go out and get it and enjoy it. However if you are an avid player of the game for years, this is the cheapest product quality of all the versions. It's no longer plastic, it's all card board. Every piece from the board to the titles is card board. So if you are looking for a version to just take with you wherever you go and not have to worry about damaging it then get this one because you can always just buy another version and replace it.So in short, it's the same game it's always been. It's a cheap board with cheap pieces to bring down the cost of the product. I think if Hasbro ever releases this game again they should spend a bit more time on quality durable design and go back to plastic pieces. They should also attempt to make a travel version of the game. I'm personally working on a design for that very purpose. Who knows, maybe with a lot of luck Hasbro might pick it up and use the design.

A game of strategy on the level of ""Risk"" players must build and invest in ""corporations"" which are then acquired by larger corporations in a continually changing landscape which enables the game to be unique each time it is played. Players must decide which stock to buy and carefully strategize in order to maintain a continuous cash flow and obtain majority stockholder positions in order to achieve a big payout in the end.On the merit of the game itself I would have given this a five star rating, but the disappointing build quality tempts me to lower that to two stars.

It's a bit confusing to switch between the two since some hotels with the same name have different values, but it's not too tough to make the adjustment.One thing we do to hold our tiles in the older game (which doesn't come with its own holder) is use the tile holders from Scrabble; they work great for holding the plastic tiles.This is a great game for anyone high-school age or older.  It requires thought, planning, strategy, and the usual bit of luck.  Some of our best moments have come when one person's plans are unwittingly destroyed by someone else, a common occurence.  Sometimes we even have a surprise ending (i.e. the person who seemed to be ahead the whole game gets narrowly beaten out).The one drawback to this game is that, if you are not involved in the first few mergers, you have a high risk of sitting there the rest of the game with nothing to do and no chance to win.

I cannot believe with all the gamers I know that no one else has ever played this.  Way better than Monopoly, much quicker with layers of subtlety and depth that make this easy to learn and very hard to master.  My gaming group always seems to find the time to play a round of Aquire every time we get together.  The hardest part I have found is adjusting your strategy depending on the number of players as this will change how you approach your buying and takeovers.Components:  I have seen many complaints about the quality of the components of this version, and many of them are founded and some I think are exaggerated a bit.  The cheapest component are the tile holders, definately seen better there.  The tiles themselves are quite sturdy and although they do not lock down like previous editions I don't have that much of an issue with them moving all over the board.  The stock certificate cards are quite good, though a bit more color variety would be nice. The Worldwide, American, and Tower stocks are a little too close in color to each other.Overall I say this is a great game, certainly one of my new all time favorites.

This map pack comes with one double sided maps -- two BRAND NEW maps total, plus two figures -- including one EXCLUSIVE figure.  Here are the two key reasons I decided to give this item five stars.First, you get two figures with the map pack: Luminara Unduli, Jedi Master (see stats below) and a Battle Droid.  And, while the Battle Droid is a reprint, the Luminara figure is exclusive to this map pack and is therefore unavailable anywhere else.  Further, the Luminara figure is very good (maybe better) for the points.  Here are her stats, special abilities, and force powers (note: a detailed description of each  SA and FP is available in the Star Wars Minis Rule Book Glossary, or on the Wizards of the Coast web page):Luminara Unduli, Jedi Master -- Republic -- 40 points110 Hit Pints20 Defense11 Attack20 DamageSAs: Unique, Melee Attack, Double Attack, Soresu Style, SynergyFPs: Force 4, Lightsaber Reposte, Master SpeedSecond, and perhaps more importantly, this set includes a nice new double sided map -- two new maps total (""Chrystal Caves of Ilum"" on one side and ""Coruscant Streets"" on the other side). To me, these two new maps alone are worth the entire price of the map pack (i.e., since the map you pick and play on can influence the game as much as the figures you chose to play with).As noted in my other map pack reviews, the only down side to all the map packs is that if you are new to the game and just want to give it a try, then these new map packs are NOT the way to go. Instead, new players who what to try the game out should buy the Clone Wars Starter Set instead.  As I wrote in my review of the starter set, it is very reasonably priced, includes six figures -- including two exclusive figures, two exclusive maps, and everything else you need to play.In sum, I think this item is a great deal for the price, and I think most casual and experienced players will definitely want to purchase this map pack for the exclusive figure and the two new maps.",5.0,"Great looking maps, and great exclusive figure, too",1250553600,"08 18, 2009",Toys_and_Games,1.0

I play both the widesweeping Axis & Allies 1942 (originally I played the Axis & Allies Revised game) and Axis & Allies Miniatures game. I also own some of the Naval Miniatures, but find that I do not enjoy them as much as the Land Miniatures.I do, however, try to be frugal with my booster buying, always wanting to find the best deal, even when I am asking for them for Christmas. Which brings up odd thing, I own no North Africa units. I own some that were in other packs, but none from the North Africa line. Yet on Amazon.com, the North Africa map pack was the best deal.It was rather odd asking for some plastic coated pieces of paper, but I knew that the new maps would change the dynamics of play, as the three double-sided maps had desert on one side and jungle on the other.But ach! I was rather disappointed in some ways. For one thing, the makers could have spent a little more time in simply using a spell checker for their new terrain-specific rules. The terrain rules themselves were very good, but spelling errors were throughout (assult?!) and little things I didn't expect, like Vehicles being told that they had cover on a 5+ roll in jungle hexes - terrain impassable for them - and unclear rules regarding barrens. (However, at the maker's website they have a very good comprehensive terrain chart that clears things up.) Then also, no information on where to place objectives was provided, forcing me to choose hexes on my own, trying to be as fair and realistic as possible. This might not be so bad for someone who plays mainly scenarios, but it was annoying for me, a standard battle player.The scenarios, however, seemed good, though I don't play scenarios. Nevertheless, on top of requiring many specific units, one of them required the players to put three maps together, something requiring a very large table. Then too, no jungle scenarios were provided, only desert ones.Well, now that I have thoroughly played down this product, on to the good stuff: The maps themselves were amazing. If you only own the maps that came with the 1939-1945 Starter, this will be no more of the same. The desert maps are great, forcing the commanders to think much differently (fancy tank manuevers galore) and for me, an infantry endgame nut, the jungle maps were extremely interesting. I found myself slugging it out in the jungle more often than the desert, something I didn't expect. Indeed, the maps themselves nix any of the other defects. A little research online, and the text errors are cleared. A little creativity, and the objective problem is solved. The maps are well worth any extra effort you have to put in.",5.0,"Awesome maps, fine scenarios. But no objectives? And ""assult""?",1265414400,"02 6, 2010",Toys_and_Games,1.0

The Youtube videos help quite a bit, and the play through I saw, was a big part of why I made the initial purchase.

We bought this for a friend for Christmas (they love board games and we play D&D; together) and we all set down and played it one afternoon. I haven't played all the modules yet, but here's our opinion on the product.Like: Overall it was very fun, challenging, and required teamwork.This game requires you to work together as a team (if more than one player), so it's great for playing with kids to build teamwork skills.Cooperative play means you aren't playing against each other. There aren't many games out there that don't pit you against a friend. There isn't even a DM.This game was challenging without being too difficult. There were times we came really close to losing, but we always scraped through.The minis are good quality plastic (similar to minis out of the D&D; Miniatures Collection) though unpainted. We did not find this to be disappointing however, as our friend enjoys painting miniatures himself.Dislikes:There are a lot of pieces (though not as many asArkham Horror) and they're made out of cardboard. They are good quality but frequent use can degrade paper pretty fast. I highly recommend little snack ziplock bags to keep all the pieces separate. A large table is definitely needed for this board game.Overall this game was great fun. It's important to note it is NOT D&D.; However, it is similar in style to D&D; 4th edition, but the rules are not the same.",5.0,Reminds me of HeroQuest!,1297468800,"02 12, 2011",Toys_and_Games,1.0

I own another D&D; board game called Lords of Waterdeep (I love this game)...this game is nothing like Ravenloft, but I hoped it would aspire to the greatness of that game.Opening the game I got excited about the contents of the package.

I was less excited about the thick rule book, and then reading through it the vagueness of some of the rule structures. Then we sat down to play the game.  Don't get me wrong I like hard games that are nearly impossible to beat, but most games tend to have some sort of reprieve from the dangers around you.  This game continually floods you with monsters and or environment challenges.  You can barely kill one creature before you get another one attacking you, then if you stay in one place to long, magically the room develops new traps or hazards that are more deadly then the monsters themselves.I am not one of those guys that likes leaving the badies live either so maybe that was my problem.

While borrowing some concepts from DnD (or any dungeon game really), it is definitely not as intricate as actual DnD and way more visceral.

There are a lot of pieces and depending on the scenario you choose, you may use very little or a lot of them. The figures are very good and we even used a few of them in our actual DnD games :P.

It is a moderately complex game, particularly for players who have never played a fantasy role playing game.  After playing a solo adventure and a group adventure, the game mechanics and rules are straight forward and easy to remember.  It is still a hard game to win.Castle Ravenloft is a very large game with lots of pieces.  It comes with more than 40 unpainted miniatures as well as dozens more dungeon tiles, cards, tokens, etc.  There are more than a dozen adventures in the adventure book.  With the random dungeon creation and the various hero arraignments, it has great replay value.The quality of the game seems first rate.  The dungeon tiles and tokens are made of thick cardboard.  Take care in punching the pieces out of their cardboard frames and they should last a long time.  The unpainted miniatures are made of plastic.  A few of the miniatures have bent weapons or other parts that should be straight.The rules are spread across the rule book, the scenario book and the various game cards.  It takes a few plays to get the game play down.  If you don't know what a particular marking on a dungeon tile means, ignore it, as it most likely is explained/used in a later adventure.This game seems to be designed for future expansion and customer content.  Following the pattern of the existing adventures, heroes, monsters and villains, it's fairly easy to create your own adventures.If you find the rules too hard or too easy, modify them or create your own.  For example, we play with two house rules.  First, if two or more heroes flank a monster/villain, the flanking heroes get a +2 to their attack role.  Same rule applies if two or more monster/villains flank a hero.  Second, if you have not moved your maximum squares when uncovering a new tile, you can continue moving into that new tile until you use up your speed and possibly get the drop on a monster if you have not already used your attack.This is a great dungeon crawl game without the time, preparation, and number of players required for a full D&D; RPG adventure.  No dungeon master is required.At $65 MSRP, the game is a little expensive, although, if you enjoy Dungeons and Dragons type games as well as miniatures, the game is well worth the price.

We have played every day since we bought it, and they keep asking for more. The game does not require a Dungeon Master, we all 3 play as Heroes, but since they are so young I still have a Dungeon Master role during the gameplay, just to keep thing fair and challenging, and not frustrating.It's easier than standard Role Playing books:1) You can read all rules in one hour, for sure you will need to read again some parts, but you will understand the whole game completely after just the first adventure.2) There is only one dice, a 20 sided one.3) Magic and Spells is supported by cards, which make them very easy to use and you will know when you cannot use the spell anymore.4) All monsters and villains have a card, so its easy to access AC (Armour Class), HP (Hit Points) and Attacks (Hit chance modifier and damage)5) Using tiles and 3D figures make it easier to follow the action, take turns and know the distance required for each ability.6) A lot of provided tokens help on counting damage, tracking time, and even temporary effects of spells.It's faster to setup and finish1) You are not longer required to spend 4 hours creating the characters and 12 weekends to complete an adventure with your nerdy friends, you can setup an adventure in 5 minutes and have fun right away. You can finish it in around one hour, so the reward comes quicker.2) I find the provided Adventure Book very simple yet very original and fun. I will tech you creatives ways to take advantage of the board game, so you can create your own adventures lates.3) The Random dungeon creation is great, saves time, and no longer requires a Dungeon Master. So everybody can play as Hero, there is no more Nerdy Dungeon Master.Leaves Room for Imagination1) Even though rules are very basic, I find it to be very open to real role play, improvisation and storytelling.2) My younger child, which is only 5 years old, wanted to play as a Werewolf instead of using one the Heros that came. I found that this was 100% possible, I just gave him the Werewolf card and the Werewolf 3D figure and he was super happy.3) My older kid, 6 years old, wanted to have a wolf pet, and to share Hit Points between his Wizard and his pet, just as a ""Familiar"" on the classic D&D.; I said, why not?

You get quality monster and player miniatures which are better than the flat tokens you get in other sets as well as customizable dungeon tiles that equal the quality of dungeon tiles sold is D&D tile sets, but have the ability to connect to form a dungeon as solid as a mat which wont break apart (because of a puzzle like design at the end of each tile).

I know that seems unlikely, but hear me out.  The D&D; Red Box Starter Set is focused mostly on developing an abbreviated character, and once you have worked through the module there is no use for the module ever again.  It is one shot and then it is over.  Not only that, but the next step is to purchase Heroes of the Fallen Lands, which will tell you to take your abbreviated character and rework it from scratch.  To be quite frank, Heroes of the Fallen Lands does a very good job walking you through the process of creating a complete character from scratch, much better than the original 4e Players Handbook.  It makes me regret getting the D&D; Red Box Starter Set.  The D&D; Red Box Starter Set had my kids and I spending so much time penciling in figures on a character sheet, it really hampered our ability to play.Castle Ravenloft comes with 5 already configured characters.

In addition to that, this game can be easily played over and over again.  The game comes with 13 adventures and the website had 5 more I could print up.

It does require some careful reading, but, after a few games, you'll get the hang of it. It used to take us a few minutes to do a turn, now its like clockwork. Its very easy to pick up.The adventures are lots of fun too. There are 13 adventures (2 single player and 11 group) to play, each one with their own alterations of the rules.Another nice thing, especially if you have a smaller group, is there is no ""dungeon master"". Everyone is working together.the mini's are unpainted, but this helps you quickly find the monsters in the box. I'm planning on atleast painting the heros and vilians; I wish they'd used a better base color than dark blue for the heros.I've already preordered the new one that comes out in february.",4.0,Dungeons and Dragons Lite,1287792000,"10 23, 2010",Toys_and_Games,1.0
{'$oid': '5a13282b741a2384e879af28'},AVQAGJJLEMVH6,0786955570,Dhampire,"[119, 124]","Caveat: I played this game at GenCon (Indianapolis; August 4 - 8, 2010) however, as of this writing, the game is not yet available. At the time it was a complete shrink-wrapped game box and package as one would purchase and I am inclined to believe that it is the finished product, pending any severe issues that may have come up during the course of people playing it at the convention.Now, on with the review:The components of this game are many. There are several sheets of punch tiles that comprise the game boards, character cards, status modifiers, health pips, coffins, etc. The box, itself, makes for a poor means to store all of these bits and pieces and you may consider baggies, counter trays, or other means of keeping certain tokens from intermingling between sessions to make set-up go a little more smoothly. The parts themselves are very sturdy wood-stock bits (similar to those used by Fantasy Flight Games - for those familiar with their board game offerings) and are therefore quite robust and will last you many-many years without damage or loss from being blown aside by a mild cough. There are several plastic miniatures, of excellent quality (unpainted), that are conveniently color coded by type. Undead (skeletons, zombies, etc) are white, animals are brown, spectral undead (ghosts, specters, etc) are a translucent blue, notorious villains (Strahd, werewolf, etc) are a dark grey, and the heroes are alight grey. I found this distinction to be very helpful in taking quick glances of the board and seeing how monsters were grouped versus the distribution of the PCs as well as seeing where any allies were located and obstacles between without having to examine every mini on the grid. This also makes monster placement simpler in that you are now examining a smaller pool of minis to locate rats, versus having to search though all of them at once.The game `board' is crafted through the course of play. Several tiles represent rooms and corridors of the castle and as you and your fellow heroes move, more of the castle is revealed. This is similar to the Avalon Hill game ""The Betrayal at the House on the Hill"". Unlike that game, heroes do not need to enter the tile/room to place it but simply be near the edge of a tile. With each tile enters a new monster, and possibly an encounter based on the mark on the tile, who goes under the control of the player that drew it and it will perform certain specific actions on the monster turn of the game. Defeating monsters gains the heroes equipment and experience points. The experience points go into a community pool and can be used to level up your hero or negate certain encounters.Aside from the rule booklet, there is also a scenario booklet. The scenario you choose will determine the victory conditions for the game. The game itself is cooperative and either the entire group wins or all of the heroes lose. Some of the scenarios seemed capable of being linked together (the scenario we played was ""Hunt for Strahd, part one"") and can become part of a larger and longer game played over several weekends. I should also think that one could also invent new scenarios not included with the original book.While the hero cards are definitely crafted with the current Dungeons and Dragons rules set in mind (4th edition) they only seem to have a 1st level and 2nd level power set. This makes the bookkeeping minor and even someone (like myself) who has not played the fourth edition of the game is capable of comprehending and understanding their hero.I found this game quite enjoyable and useful. It serves perfectly well as a board game by itself. For those Table-Top RPG gamers, its beautifully printed tiles, tokens, and the included minis, can very easily serve as dungeon mapping for your home campaigns. This game would also do well for those parents out there looking for a way to let their children experience RPG style play without delving into the morass of character sheets, race selection, statistic generation, and all of the bulk of the RPG system.

Searching the internet for an easy way to break in to D&D; brings me to the board game Dungeons and Dragons Wrath of Ashardalon.  As I read the description (or maybe it was a review) I notice that there is a Ravenloft version!  I check it out, see the good reviews and buy it.Boy was I ever NOT disappointed!  This game is great.  All the fun of D&D; without the need to read a ton of books (yes, in this game there is a fair amount of reading, but not too bad) or roll a character or keep track of too much.  Yes, some hard-core D&D; people may find it a little limited and too easy, but if that is the case, just play D&D; on your own.  This game is much better for the first-timers and the uninitiated.  Very easy to play and not a lot of time invested to get there.  I mean, it's probably on par with like a good game of Risk or a real game of Monopoly (without all the shortcuts.)  Great for board game enthusiasts and the D&D; curious.The game itself is really something.  Very well-made in every way.  Good game board tiles, great cards and tokens and players and monsters too.  All very durable and cool.  Since purchasing, I have played about five games.  Once by myself to see if it was any fun alone (it actually is) and a bunch of games with my son and some others.  Every time was fun, even when we lost (some of the dungeons can be very hard!) and I can't wait to play more.I highly recommend this game if you are looking for a fun board game with friends for a few hours and you like the idea of D&D; without all the books and commitment.",5.0,Ravenloft without the commitment,1370390400,"06 5, 2013",Toys_and_Games,1.0

She loves the miniatures and rolling dice, but I wanted to increase the complexity of our little games a bit and I had been eye-balling this (and the Wrath of Ashardalon) set and thought I'd give it a go to see if she'd get into one of these board games.First off, I was a little worried that this game would not be durable to withstand a hyper 5 year old girl, but after the initial un-boxing and then about an hour of game play, I can assure you that this product should withstand some decent use. I even let her pop out half the board pieces (she loved doing that) and I was happy to find that these popped out easily without tearing, etc. The miniatures are sturdy enough too (I think they are exactly the usual D&D; Mini's, just not painted).In regards to the actual game, it took me about an hour to un-box and then read the instruction. The basic instructions did not make full sense right away, but after getting into game-play and following the included card with the steps of your round (Hero phase -> Exploration phase -> Villain phase), it sank in fairly quickly. I basically had to walk my daughter through the entire encounter but SHE LOVED IT. She quickly picked up on some of the basic math; i.e. she understood the basic mechanics of attack rolls having to be higher than the targets AC and she was able to do the basic math of a d20 + attack bonus (usually). Of course, what she couldn't do was read any of the cards or strategize her moves; but she was just happy to be playing a game and was eager to just do what Daddy told her to do!Then, let's talk about the treasure cards: she LOVES treasure (I taught her to call these ""Phat Loot"" cards! LOL) and she loved rolling the d20, even if there is no reason whatsoever to roll the dice, she just rolls and rolls.Anyway, Parents, if you are looking to nerdify your little kids without abandon, then don't be turned off by the recommended age of 12+ on this product, I think you can still find this to be a fun game with younger kids and may even introduce them to some basics of table top RPG mechanics.",5.0,Fun.

I only had to make a few changes. Instead of always drawing a card when you don't explore, I roll a d20, 1-15 draw, 16-20 don't draw. This really stopped if from feeling like you had no hope, without making it to easy. Also, I don't discard and redraw when a encounter isn't relevant, you don't redraw treasures when not relevant, I don't think you should have to redraw encounters. When I lvl to lvl 2, I heal for healing surge.I'm thinking of also letting you remove environmental cards from play by spending exp, I'm thinking 7-10. People should give the game a try with these slight mods, I find they still keep the balance of play, while adding 100% to the enjoyment.I have many other ideas to improve play, I'll look into play testing and writing them up. I know some people feel like the rules of a game are written in stone, I say rules are made to be broken. You paid good money for this game, why not adapt it to your needs.

In this game, the players cooperatively play through different adventures in a randomly generated dungeon to achieve a common goal.  Either everyone wins or everyone loses.  There is no ""Dark Lord"" or ""GM"" player.  Everyone plays a character, and the party/company of heroes is in it together.

First off, I love this game. I rarely take time to review anything. In this case, I have seen a number of reviewers who were a little harsh based on their expectations. So, I wanted to add my two cents.What is Castle Ravenloft? This game is not the D&D; most people are used to. D&D; lite is a pretty good way of describing it and that's what I love about it. Castle Ravenloft is a much more accessible form of D&D; for geeks and nongeeks alike. It's like some other reviewers have mentioned, it's a great game to sit down and play for an hour or two and is simple enough for people who have never touched this kind of stuff to pick up and learn pretty quickly. The best way to play this game is have a few beers, joke around about how screwed you are (the game is actually very difficult, especially if your Dragonborn fighter can't seem to kill anything), and just roll with it.There really isn't any role playing involved (unless your gaming crew decides to add it in). It's all about the D20 combat system (based around 4th edition rules) and quite a bit of luck as well. You slowly reveal the dungeon, battle monsters, get treasure, and work on accomplishing whatever goal you have to to win the game. It's a relatively quick and fun way to get into the D&D; universe without having to commit hours and hours like you would with a normal D&D; adventure.There are a couple of other things worth mentioning. For the price, you get quite a few miniatures. They aren't painted, but they would still make excellent figures for a DM to use in a regular campaign. If you're into painting, there isn't anything stopping you from painting them as well. The artwork and quality of the pieces is fantastic. The board, tokens, and most of the figures are sturdy and with proper care, should last a long time.Why didn't I give it a perfect score?-I would have liked to see more monster variety. Although, you can mix the contents of this D&D; board game with the two others that are out to give you more variety of monsters and heroes.-There are a few figures that are a bit flimsy and could easily be broken if you don't store it right or you allow younger children to play.Overall, the game is well worth the price and I promise you if you go into it with a few friends, an open mind, and not expecting a full fledged D&D; session, you will have a lot of fun with this!",4.0,Go in with an open mind and you'll have a great time!,1399161600,"05 4, 2014",Toys_and_Games,1.0

It's basically a combination of high fantasy and horror---think dwarves and elves battling werewolves and vampires, and you'll start to get the idea.It's worth noting what this game is not: it is not a role playing game by any stretch of the imagination (wordplay not intended, but I'll take credit for it). Aside from a few lines of flavor text you read at the beginning of each adventure, there isn't much of a sense of character and setting. You won't be going to town to buy equipment, you won't be bargaining with shopkeeps, and you won't be crafting an elaborate back story for your character. Castle Ravenloft is essentially a tile exploration game in which you move your miniature, draw a tile, place a monster figure on it, and roll a die to see if you get hit. Then, on your next turn, you'll attempt bloody revenge, rolling in an effort to make monster stew. Well, maybe not monster stew. Unless you like to eat kobolds. I mean, do what you like, I won't judge you. But eating kobolds, man? Seriously??Ahem, anyhoo, you'll progress through the stack of tiles, eventually reaching a goal tile. The goal tile is usually anywhere from 10-15 tiles deep, and most adventures --the game comes with a good number of different adventures to choose from -- most adventures will feature a ""boss"" you'll try to slay once you reach the goal. Along the way you'll draw lots of Encounter cards, which are generally pretty brutal (roll a die and add 8, if it hits you, take a couple damage. Oh and if it misses you, go ahead and take one damage).You'll also get treasure cards, which are rewards a Hero gets for killing a monster. These can be items that provide bonuses to die rolls; sometimes they're ""blessings"" which provide an immediate, one-time benefit.That's pretty much it. There are wrinkles here and there-- the different adventures in the provided booklet do a good job mixing up goals and tile layouts-- but overall, the game is somewhat repetitive. Don't expect a lot of tactical choices and depth from Castle Ravenloft.It's worth mentioning that this is a cooperative game. The players don't compete, but rather work together toward a common goal. This ensures that no one has to play the ""bad guys"", ie, control the monsters, there are simple instructions printed on each monster card that tell you what the monster does (""move next to the closest hero and attack"".)All this might make it sound like I don't like the game. On the contrary, I do quite like it. It plays in an hour, which is great. It really does provide a cool ""D&D; Lite"" experience. It looks great on the table. Who doesn't want to play with plastic monsters and heroes?? It also scales well with different numbers of players, being equally good played solo or with the full complement of five players.If you are looking for a quick-playing dungeon crawl, this is the one to get. Just realize what it isn't: it isn't a deep tactical exercise, and it isn't a role playing game.

Not a big deal, but something that could have been addressed to save us some confusion.---Mechanics/Ease of Play - 9.0---""It's fun and really easy - there's just 3 things to do on my turn"" - My wife.That quote from my wife, though an oversimplification, is really a great indicator for the simple, but enjoyable mechanics that drive the gameplay of Castle Ravenloft and drive-home the point that you don't have to know anything about Dungeons & Dragons to have a great time(though you'll certainly be a step ahead if you're already familiar with the d20 system).SetupThe included scenario book provides about 20 varied adventures for the players (from 1 to 5 of them) to tackle cooperatively. Each scenario has a set of victory and failure conditions that tie each of the Heroes(as the players are called) together in pursuit of a specific goal. Each scenario has specific directions to facilitate crafting the game board appropriately. In general, the dungeon(game board) is pieced together at the players direction as tiles, monsters, encounters and treasures are drawn randomly from shuffled piles. Not only does this provide for some great replay value, but it also adds an element of suspense as players have no idea what is lurking around the ""next corner"".Each player chooses one of the 5 provided heroes to play during the course of the scenario: Cleric, Fighter, Ranger, Rogue or Wizard. Each of the heroes has a corresponding ""hero tile"" that contains all of the details specific to that ""class"". Of particular note are the values for Armor Class(AC), Speed, Hit Points(HP) and Surge Value(a concept Wizards of the Coast first introduced with D&D; 4e). Each player then chooses a set of 4 to 6 ""powers"" from a deck of about 10 hero-specific cards. Each deck consists of various at-will, daily and utility powers. At-will powers can be used repeatedly throughout the scenario, whereas daily and utility powers are expended upon use and only brought back into play by certain treasure items. Helpfully, Wizards included a ""recommended"" list of power card for each hero that I have found to be very effective, while still providing advanced players with the opportunity to ""fine tune"" their powers based on specific scenarios.Your turnPlayers collectively decide who will go first and play then goes around the table. Each turn consists of three ""phases"" that dictate the flow of each turn:The Hero PhaseThe first part of your turn, the hero phase is just what it sounds like - where the Hero takes the spotlight. During this phase you will be moving your hero miniature around the game board and attacking monsters that you discover. You can use one ""attack"" power card per turn, as well as utility powers as indicated by the description. Your movements are nearly as important as your attacks, allowing you to ""explore"" new areas of the dungeon in the exploration phase to follow, avoid traps, or flee from monsters. The relatively small number of powers to choose from combined with simple rules for movement makes your choices feel meaningful without getting bogged down in a tedium of rules deliberation. I found the powers very easy to use, while maintaining the elements of choice so important to the RPG genre.Based on the d20 system, each attack involves rolling a twenty-sided die, adding a modifier and comparing the result to the Armor Class(AC) of the target. If the roll plus modified is equal or greater than the AC, your attack hits the target and deals damage; otherwise, your attack misses and usually has no effect.The Exploration PhaseThe dungeon is built primarily in the exploration phase based on your actions during the Hero phase based on the concept of an ""unexplored edge"". Simply put, any dungeon tile edge that is not depicted as a wall, nor already connected to another dungeon tile is considered to be an ""unexplored edge"" and thus, ripe for hero exploration. If the hero phase ends with your miniature positions adjacent to an unexplored edge, you draw a new dungeon tile and place it next to your hero. In addition, you draw a card from the ""Monster"" deck and place the appropriate miniature on the new tile on top of the pile of skulls that each dungeon tiles has. Each of the Monster cards has all of the stats(AC, HP) and tactics(how it attacks and moves) listed similar to the Hero tiles that you choose from before the game starts. This is important - in Castle Ravenloft YOU will control each of the monsters that you draw from the deck until they are killed by your party of heroes(or less-pleasantly, until you are killed by them).The Villain PhaseIf you did not draw a new dungeon tile during the exploration phase or if you drew a dungeon tile marked with a black triangle (anecdotally about 50% of the tiles are black and 50% are white, though I haven't actually counted them) you will also draw an ""Encounter"" card. These Encounter cards are always negative events, that will impact one or more of the heroes in some way. Most encounters are some type of attack against all heroes in the current heroes dungeon tile; this could be a one-time attack, or it could be a persistent ""trap"" device that is activated along with monsters you may also control. In addition to straight-up attacks, you can also find ""Environment"" effects that last until another ""Environment"" card is drawn - these can do anything from reducing all heroes' speed by 1 to forcing you to roll twice for every attack and use the lower result. These cards can be quite devastating when the heroes are clumped together on the same tile, so they force you to spread out or risk a catastrophic event. During gameplay, the Encounters really increased the pacing and level of urgency.After you determine that an Encounter card should/should not be drawn, you activate all of the monsters and traps under your control in the order they were drawn. Far less arbitrary than it sounds, a player reads the concise ""tactics"" for each Monster or TrapThe d20Ah, the d20 (20-sided die) - bringer of fortune and failure alike - it is the foundational element in Castle Ravenloft and what really ties the mechanics to Dungeons & Dragons.---Fun Factor - 8.0---Despite a somewhat slow start(due to setup, reading/explaining the ""adventure"", etc.), the game quickly picks up the pace into what can only be described as a frantic, entertaining fight to survive that only ends when you've completed the heroic objective or have died trying! Your success (or failure) is based almost entirely on how well (or poorly) you managed the constant barrage of monsters, traps, and events that are thrown at the party. Fail to control the onslaught and you will be quickly overrun as the monsters reach an unstoppable critical mass.The designers have done an excellent job of making every adventure take you to cusp of destruction when you finally reach your objective and (hopefully) emerge from the Castle Ravenloft dungeons as victorious heroes.However, after a few games I did find that my selection of actions(during the Hero phase) seemed to grow less interesting. A larger selection of power cards would be a welcomed addition and would likely remedy this minor drawback.---Craftsmanship/Art - 7.0---The craftsmanship is at a higher level than I expected(due to low expectations), but seems appropriate considering the cost of the game. The game tiles and hero cards, in particular, have a nice weight to them that lends to the impression of high-caliber materials. One notable exception, are the miniatures - outside of the ""main bad guys""(which have decent quality), the miniatures seem cheap and prone to breakage. The hero miniatures in particular, bend easily and one or two of them fall over easily. This is one area for improvement, especially considering the cost of the game.The art direction is consistent with the rest of the Dungeons & Dragons product line. For those not familiar, it is fairly typical fantasy art with an emphasis on ""realistic portrayal"", as opposed to the over-exaggerated caricatures found in anime, etc. Suitable for developing the mood of the game, I found it to be quite adequate - nothing more, nothing less.There was a lot of room for Wizards to ""WOW!"" me with the craftsmanship and art here - sadly, they didn't take full advantage. It's more of a ""nitpick"" for me, but as the only real ""flaw"" in the game, I felt it is worth mentioning.---Replay Value - 9.0---The very nature of the game(building the game board as play progresses) results in a new experience every time, even when playing the same ""adventure"". Combinations of hero classes and the inclusion of 20 unique adventures provide abundant material for even the most avid gamer. I have owned the game for over a year now and have yet to even play through all of the adventures once, much-less play through them repeatedly.Unlike many board games that fall into predictable patterns of play, the designers of Castle Ravenloft have managed to create a game that feels familiar to those with experience without succumbing to repetition, boredom, and ultimately disinterest.If you and your gaming group are looking for a game to hold your interests through multiple gatherings, Castle Ravenloft is one that I highly recommend!---Conclusion - 8.3 Great! Highly Recommended Purchase.--The mechanics and replay value really set Dungeons & Dragons: Castle Ravenloft apart from other games and serve to polish and balance the ""meh"" art and craftsmanship that would have otherwise detracted from the overall appeal. A job well done and an excellent addition to your gaming repertoire that will last through many gatherings. As an added benefit, Ravenloft also serves as a great tool for introducing otherwise hesitant friends to the Dungeons & Dragons RPG - which otherwise has a fairly high learning curve.",4.0,Castle Ravenloft Board Game Review,1329350400,"02 16, 2012",Toys_and_Games,1.0

As we got older and made families we just didn't have the time to play anymore.  This board game is great on so many levels.  It is great for people like me who would like to feel like they are playing D&D; and need to do it in an hour and a half.  It is great intro for people who are curious about D&D; but have never played before.  They won't get very deep into the D&D; rule set but will get an introduction to HP, AC, movement, classes and other basic concepts.  It is also great for anyone who just wants to play an adventure game and doesn't care what world it is set in.The game comes with a bunch of highly detailed miniatures that are begging to be painted but are wonderful as they are.  The board pieces are of high quality and they are placed mostly randomly so the layout will never be the same twice.  The characters are well thought out and there really isn't a 'stronger' character in the bunch, they all have their pluses.  There are quite a few adventures to play through and there are more user created adventures online.  If you are feeling creative you can even make your own.The game works very well no matter how many people are playing.  It doesn't feel any harder or easier whether you have two players or five.  Also, you can play this game solo which is very cool.  Being a cooperative game, everyone is in it together.  I have read a lot about how the game is difficult but we have won the adventures probably 80% of the time.  Two games were won literally at the last possible move that we could stay alive.  It is very exciting when that happens and it always seems close no matter what.  The role playing element is very light.  You don't keep anything your character finds from one adventure to the next so you are starting from scratch every time you play.  However, depending on who you are playing with and how &#34;into character&#34; they wish to be, there are still plenty of role playing opportunities for those who wish to take them.This is the first of three games in the set.

My wife recently mentioned that she would like to give D&D; a try, and I figured that this game would be an excellent way to dip our toes in without the need for a dedicated group of players, a huge time commitment and hundreds of pages of rulebooks. I ended up getting it as a birthday present a few days ago, and so far it has lived up to expectations.The best thing for us is that everyone plays a hero; there is no need for a DM. In fact, the game can even be played solo, though that takes most of the fun out of it. The dungeon is generated randomly using interlocking tiles, and monsters and traps are controlled by the players using simple scripts. There are also no character sheets; everything is kept track of using cards and little cardboard counters. This is a dungeon crawl plain and simple with very little actual role-playing involved. You can go up to level 2 within an adventure, but there is no continuity between adventures. You simply pick one of the pre-defined characters and keep slaying monsters until you meet whatever the particular adventure's objective is, then pick a new adventure in no particular order and start again next time. While this limits the complexity of the game quite a bit, it also makes it totally ""pick up and play"" and eliminates the logistical nightmares of getting together a dedicated group of players on a regular basis. You can simply have a ""game night"" and whoever shows up grabs a character and jumps in.From our experience with our first couple of adventures, this game can be quite challenging. Your characters are subjected to a huge amount of punishment, including constant attacks from monsters and ""encounters"" that are almost always something nasty. Hit points become a precious resource to be jealously husbanded, and healing surges (which are like continues in a video game) go quickly. If even one player dies with no healing surges left, it's game over. However, you can adjust the difficulty by changing the number of healing surges that you start out with. For our first couple of games we decided to go with 3 instead of the recommended 2, which turned out to be a good idea.The game box itself is massive and contains a ton of components, including 41 heavy card stock dungeon tiles, 42 plastic miniatures (including a massive skeletal dragon), and 200 Encounter, Monster and Treasure cards. Everything seems to be high quality, and though the miniatures are mass-produced plastic and probably not the highest quality miniatures available, they get the job done nicely. I'm sure if you were so inclined you would be able to use these figures and tiles for a regular D&D; campaign. There is also a ton of room for additions to the standard rules and adventures included in this box. In addition to the 13 adventures included in the box, there are a number available for free download from the Wizards of the Coast website. You can also make up your own fairly easily, and the basic rules are simple enough that you can add your own house rules to suit your tastes.Overall, I'm very happy with this product. If you are a hard core roleplayer you will probably complain that this is too simple, but for people like me the fact that it is simple and self-contained is a big part of its appeal. I can happily report that my wife, who has never played this type of game before, has enjoyed herself every time we've played and is excited about trying out more adventures. We will be getting a ton of use out of this.",5.0,Loving it so far,1334793600,"04 19, 2012",Toys_and_Games,1.0

The rulebook can seem both over complicated and lacking sufficient instruction depending on the stage of the game.  The only way to learn and enjoy the game is to play, (and most likely screw it up the first time), while correcting errors as you go and remembering it for the next time.Once you actually undersand the game, however, it can be great fun. If you play tabletop, this is a great way to get your fix in an hour, And it can even be played solo. I can totally recommend this game to any adult with tabletop experience, who has similarly inclined friends, and a good-sized table.  To others, though, the rules may be a headache, and it doesn't have the traditional competitive vibe associated with board games.  You either succeed as a team or fail together, so competitive board-gamers will be denied their fun.  At $65 msrp, I don't think I could recommend it as a casual purchase for the un-initiated, but if you're interested in a quick d&d; experience, you have the money, and you know how to roll a d20, the game can be totally worth the cost.",3.0,Not for amateurs,1290816000,"11 27, 2010",Toys_and_Games,0.0

They have had multiple rule updates, and this game is based off of the more recent changes. It plays as a simplified version that is perfect for introducing new players to the series and game play style. My wife who would have never dreamed she would enjoy something Dungeon and Dragons related actually really enjoys this game.It has 13 different scenarios which are like individual games within it. They all come together to form a complete story. You and your band of heroes are trying to protect the town of Bavoria and defeat the lord vampire Strahd. The game is played on a board that grows as you journey the dungeon and is randomized so even playing the same scenario should provide a different experience.In a regular turn you move, explore a new area, fight some monsters and then bring new monsters into the game. There are traps, different environment hazards, and treasure and items to collect and help you out.The game at its core is a story. It has decent combat and the way it handles monsters keeps the game at a decent pace and does not allow it to lull or slow down. But the theme and the story are what drives you. In the last game my wife and I had to find a alter in the dungeon and recover a holy artifact and then escape. The game has a prepared reading to set the mood, and then another once you find the alter. It gets you into the game and makes that quest unique even though you are doing the same thing as in others. If you gloss over the stuff like this and just focus on moving and rolling dice you may not enjoy this game. You have to get into your roles and use your imagination just like in a real game of Dungeons and Dragons.The game comes with miniatures to help with this, little statues for all the players and monsters. They are not painted, but the details are pretty good and it is easy to distinguish between them. There are also tons of tokens for monitoring your life, as well as pretty much anything else the game does. At first it seems overwhelming but it becomes second nature after only a few turns.I have enjoyed this game so far, it works very well as a single player game also which is a plus. It has 2 scenarios specific for this, but it is not so complicated that you can not play 2 heroes at once either. Each game lasts around a hour, and set up takes 10 minutes or so. I would recommend some card protectors as this game is card heavy.

It is fun, fast paced and always exciting. It can have 1-5 players and has a high replay value. The miniatures are not painted, but that doesn't really bother me all that much. They are good, solid quality pieces and the tiles are great stock pieces. If there was one thing I would improve on with this set, it is that the miniatures, while good pieces, could be a bit sturdier. They are normal miniature stock, but for my own personal taste, I prefer the pieces to be a bit more rigid (like in the 1990 MB game Heroquest). That is the only real complaint I have. I ordered the Wrath of Ashardalon and the two Dungeon Commander sets to go along with this game. As an avid RPG player, having the miniatures and the tiles is great, and on game days when we can't think of where to go next, the adventures in the book that comes with the sets can be a great jumping off point to segue into the game session.Overall, I give this game 5 stars and congratulate WotC for putting out a fantastic game.

The rulebook is kept fairly simple, which is good for the casual gamer. It might frustrate people who want to have every possibility covered in the rulebook, but we found that this lack of specificity encourages people to come up with their own ""House Rules"" that cover some of those special circumstances that aren't covered in the rules. We enjoy the creativity that this allows the players to use while playing. In addition, the game is different every time you play it, making the replayability a huge plus.

Moore ""Geek Dad""","[1, 1]","My boys (10 and 8) had expressed an interest in playing a traditional pen & paper RPG campaign for a while. They love fantasy world in movies, books and video games, and thought D&D; would be cool. I also thought the imagination stretching and basic math required would be a great way to stretch their minds while having fun. Unfortunately, their attention spans didn't survive our first few attempts. One day I ran across Castle Ravenloft in a hobby shop one day and decided to give it a try. It reminded me a bit of HeroQuest, a board game I loved as a kid. With pre-made characters and adventures, it looked like a hybrid between the more fully featured D&D; quests they wanted to try and the board games they already love. Best $60 dollars I've spend on a family activity.My boys love the randomness of the adventures, the combat system, and the content (what boys don't love vampires, zombies and dragons?). I love that it's cooperative, instead of competitive; so we can use teamwork and build strategies to win. I also like that they left just enough math in there to help keep their brains from being atrophied. For example, if my oldest is using the fighter character with an AC of 17  and he's fighting someone with an attack of +8, he knows he wants to roll an 8 or lower for the monster's attack. And finally, I love that the players must control the monsters too, instead of a DM controlling them.

The odds of winning are seriously stacked against the heroes, mainly due to the Encounters deck of cards. The Encounters are relentless, and I would contribute every game I've played and lost to the cards coming out of the Encounters deck.In fact, I've lost every game I've played so far, but that just keeps me coming back for more because I know the eventual victory will be oh so sweet.The only downfall to this game is that a FAQ needs to be published concerning many of the Encounter cards. Some of the text is vague, and open to interpretation during the game.

They are sturdy and are very similar to the images on the cards. They even have a special skeleton dragon, which is pretty big.Cards. There are character cards, which have their different powers. There are encounter cards, which could bring you good luck, or doom you all on your quest. There are monster cards, with descriptions of their attacks and movement. There are  treasure cards too, which help a lot on these quests.Multiple quests. There are different quests at different difficulties.

There are a lot of tiles, which are added on as the game progresses. Some are standard, and the same, but others are unique.

Most table top Role Playing Games or RPGs are very time intensive:  with a time commitment in advance to create a character, and multiple sessions to get a game started.  Now, to be fair, this is not a true RPG.  This is a ""lite"", RPG-like board game that incorporates many aspects of an RPG.  That is exactly what makes the game so great.  It's a fun game that throws you right into the action and you don't have to be a Role Playing fanatic to enjoy it.The game takes place in a single setting, Castle Ravenloft, and begins by throwing your characters into what is essentially a dungeon crawl.  The characters are pre-made and come from some pretty basic player classes from DnD 4th edition.  There is a little bit of character customization which comes from choosing your own ""powers"" or abilities that your character will use throughout the game.  Once each player has selected a character, the fun begins right away.  Each player takes turns exploring, fighting monsters, and facing the many traps and dangers that lurk within the dungeon.Scenarios are chosen from the adventure book before hand and have varying difficulties.  As the players explore the dungeon, you add new tiles to the start tile and the game board expands.  Monster, treasure and encounter cards are drawn and played as the players expand deeper and deeper into the castle.  since the dungeon tiles and game cards are always shuffled, the game will never play out the same way twice even if you are playing the same scenario.  The randomly generated factor of the game really adds a lot of replay-ability to the game.  The boss characters can also make the game very challenging.Castle Ravenloft has everything you need for your adventure packed into one complete box.  From the miniatures to the artwork on the cards and even the box itself, the game pieces are very nicely put together.  All in all, this is a solid board game that will entertain the casual player and the experienced RPG fan alike.  It is the best board I have played since Settlers of Katan and I would highly recommend it.",5.0,DnD Lite in a Board Game Setting is Surprisingly Engaging...,1288742400,"11 3, 2010",Toys_and_Games,1.0

He was already familiar with the series, but we were both beginners at the rules and nitty-gritty logistics.We have really enjoyed the game thus far.  We have both been surprised by how engaging the play is.  Waiting to see where the next tile will lead us and what the next card will bring is a lot of fun, and I think that this introduction has whetted our appetites for dungeon crawling; we already have plans to expand our collection and have found additional adventures to use when we've successfully completed the enclosed adventure pack.My one major complaint about the game is that, in condensing the rules to fit into a one-hour game, the creators may have over-simplified the rule book itself, leading to a lot of confusion for us.  Since we are not learning D & D from an experienced player, we are completely reliant on the rule book to explain even simple things like which hero is attacked if a monster is equidistant from them or whether experience is shared by the group or only held by specific players.  Our first game in particular was very frustrating because we had to constantly check the rules to explain a certain action or situation, and we were usually left with an incomplete picture of the right way to play.  Most of the online help that we found said that, in the case of ambiguity, set your own house rules and always abide by them, but since we were new to the game, we didn't really want to have to do that often (since we don't know what makes a good house rule or a fair one).All in all, we are well pleased and are getting a lot of good use out of the game already (the replay value really is incredible - I can't imagine getting bored with this game quickly).

Wizards hits this one out of the park.Inside the box, thirteen adventures await. At least two are solo adventures: one at the beginning to serve as a tutorial, and another about midway through the book. Each adventure has a goal, and employs a special mechanic or boss. This keeps the hack-and-slash experience fresh. One adventure has the party acquiring an artifact; another has the party raiding Strahd's treasure hoard! Thirteen in all.With two players (cleric and fighter), we find ourselves challenged to nearly overwhelmed. We've gone through seven adventures so far, and we've lived to tell it. The balance in the game is very good. The mechanic of this board game is that monsters spawn virtually every turn in some fashion; coupled with the random encounter cards, the characters are guaranteed to get regularly damaged. Let's just say the healing surges - two by default - have been used up in a few adventures! The cleric ""carries"" (wins in a pinch) often. :)(I imagine it's even more difficult with four people, as random events and ""target nearest hero"" rules cause the party wizard to spend all the surges!)The level cap is two, though with house-ruling you can extend it to three or even four. From one to the other, you gain +2 hp, +1 AC, and so forth, so you can extrapolate. No need to dig out your 4e PHB. :PThe deck of monster cards contains the ""AI"" that a specific monster will use. Just follow the directions, and kobold skirmishers will be hurling javelins at your heroes in no time. The game is cooperative, so your friend can make the to-hit roll on your guy.The miniatures are color-coded according to type, like undead (bone beige), powerful undead (transparent blue plastic!) or monstrous/vermin (maroon). Heroes are dark blue. I like the solid coloring rather than individual paint schemes because the miniatures can be easily retrieved from a pile and placed onto a tile.The tiles are heavy cardboard stock, much like the Dungeon Tiles series. They interlock in only one way and are very durable. You'll wonder how other game companies can get away with more flimsy stock. Wizards doesn't fool around here.The rules are simple and you will learn it in no time. There are no rules for flanking or cover, but you can easily house-rule it.I pre-ordered Ashardalon's Wrath on the strength of Castle Ravenloft.I like to think this is how 4e DND was ideally meant to be played, with clear objectives, original adventures, miniatures and tiles. There's no character development or role-playing; often, what we enjoy most is surviving to move our figures another day. :) For a game to do that without a DM is impressive.I have rated ""Educational Value"" as five stars because the game uses a specific sequence of ""phases"" during each player's turn, and tracking what's been done while resolving an encounter card, and remembering that some effect ends at the end of a hero's action phase, while also thinking about how you're going to survive with your dailies gone, requires memory and attention.",5.0,Wizards delivers,1287360000,"10 18, 2010",Toys_and_Games,1.0

While this is true, the fun factor of the game just isnt there and I will explain why:First, how the game works.  The game comes with about 30 or so ""tiles"" which are cardboard puzzle pieces about 5x5 inches long.  Each of these tiles has a diagram of a hallway, room, or corridor and a grid of squares that is used to measure the movement of your character when exploring.  In this way as you explore you draw from the puzzle pile and attach it to the area you are headed into revealing a new area with new challenges.  So far so good.The game also comes with an adventure guide that describes what you are supposed to be doing while exploring.  It also has you set up the puzzle pile in certain ways so that the event room that holds the quest is placed ""after the 8th draw"" for example.  Additionally it has other factors, some adventures are timed reflecting the sun setting, some have mini boss monsters harass the players, ect. ect.  In this way each time you play there will be some variation.  The adventure guide has some 15 or so different adventures and you are free to create your own.  Still so far so good.Before you start, you choose a character from one of the five available.  Wizard, warrior, rogue, cleric, and ranger.  Then you select powers from each of their individual decks (which is only approx 8 cards each).  You dont get all the powers, you must select which ones you want therefore further making each game different.  There is also a treasure deck and each player starts with one draw from it.  Most treasure cards are expendable one time use items such as a potion of healing or a blessing that lets you use one of your other one-time use powers again.  As you explore each monster that you kill gives you another draw from the treasure deck, as well as an experience point value based on the monster.  By this point we were very excited to play and had high hopes.All of the pieces, markers, and cards were of good quality as can be expected from a wizards of the coast product.  My friends and I are not fans of the style of the art, but do recognize its quality.  We chose an adventure and rolled to see who went first and got underway...Unfortunately from here on out, the game fell terribly short of our hopes that it would be good.  For starters, each time a player explores a new area, a monster card and sometimes an encounter card is drawn.  The games phases state that once you explore a new area you can no longer move or do anything with your character.  This means that the monster(s) that were drawn will always attack first.  This takes strategy out of exploring as the result will always be the same.  Next, if a character does not explore a new area he or she must then draw from the encounter deck and 90% of those cards are detrimental like ""each player on the tile takes 1 damage"" or ""choose a power, you can no longer use that power this adventure"".  Encounter cards are like anti-treasure cards, negative things that happen.  I dont like that each character that doesnt explore a new area must draw an encounter card because sometimes if you are fighting monsters, you dont want to explore a new area thus revealing more that you will have to deal with and that will attack before you can react.Eventually the monsters and encounter cards just grind the players down to 0 hit points where they must use one of their 2 healing surges to revive themselves.  If they have no healing surges left, the game ends in a loss.  There is no way to prevent the grind.  There doesnt seem to be any epic successes or failures for either the players or monsters.  The powers mostly just let you hit things further away from you or hit every monster on a tile, ect.  There just isnt enough variation of things to do on your turn.  Its always like ""I use magic missile."" over and over.  Moving even seems pointless since the only factor is whether you explore a new area or not thus having to draw from the encounter deck.As you gather xp you can spend it to either level up or to cancel an encounter card drawn for 5 points each.  You can only level up once.  After that there is no character progression aside from treasure which is mostly lackluster from what we saw.In conclusion, we tried the game 2 times after that first time.  Each adventure was different granted, but the constant grind was always the same.  The game has potential!  But in my opinion you must come up with some house rules to make it more strategic and fun.  I suggest:-when a new monster card is drawn by exploring a new tile roll randomly to see on which players turn the monster acts instead of it always being the explorer's turn-let players explore new areas on their movement phase so that they can still do something after they explore-double the hit points of all non-boss monsters to compensate for the above 2 items-dont force players to draw an encounter card if they attack a monster on their turn and do not explore a new areaRecommended:No",2.0,"Potential, but as is lacking...",1296950400,"02 6, 2011",Toys_and_Games,0.0

The encounter cards actually put more fear in my heart than the monsters did, since a black arrow on a tile meams you must resolve an encounter card AND a monster card.I've only yet played the first solo scenario three times and been crushed three times. One encounter card called for a monster to be activated on every unexplored map tile edge. This led to FOUR monsters being activated and another activated for placing the tile itself. This led to highly masochisticly amusing chase where running away caused more tiles to be placed, more monsters activated, more dreaded encounter cards.In the end, Count Von Strahd activated, chased me down, put me out of my misery. If this sounds like fun, buy this game NOW. Personally, I find the brutality of Castle Ravenloft refreshing. Unfair at times? Yes. Over the top at times? Yes. A DM I used to play with used Ravenloft setting as a purgatory for annoying players. If someone was rude or disruptive, all this DM had to do was say the word ""Ravenloft"" and they would adjust thier behavior.

Newnham,"[31, 40]","I just had the opportunity to play the Dungeons and Dragons Castle Ravenloft game, and I have to say that I am disappointed. Reviews I have read implied that the game was somewhat of a cross between D&D; 4th edition and Betrayal at House on the Hill (an excellent cooperative game with multiple scenarios). I really wanted to like this game. Though not a fan of D&D; 4th edition, I did consider that ruleset would make a great boardgame. Sadly, I found this game to be severely lacking.The way the game is structured, you have a scenario with a win condition known at the start of the game (the sessions I played were an escort mission, and a quest to kill a dracolich). Players then take turns moving and exploring, with player turns working much like D&D; turns. The exploration system is my primary problem with the game. You go to the edge of the board, and lay down a random tile. Every tile has a monster, and every monster immediately attacks the character. There is no opportunity for reaction, tactics, etc. There are several reasons why this is problematic.D&D; characters have strengths and weaknesses. Take, for example, the wizard. A wizard's strength is being able to attacks enemies from afar, often multiple ones. Their weakness is typically lack of ability to take damage, represented by a low hit point total. Castle Ravenloft's Exploration/Encounter system heavily penalizes the wizard character for having fewer hit points than the other characters. We came to realize that this character was just not viable for playing.Another weakness is the Exploration/Encounter system, as I mentioned before. Every exploration reveals an enemy. And while it is nice that all players cooperate, the tactics they use largely make them feel the same.Another game that occupies this same conceptual space is Descent. Also a dungeon crawl game, Descent has one player operate as the Overlord, controlling the monsters. Its gameplay is smoother and more satisfying, but it does not play so quickly. A better horror exploration game that plays in a similar amount of time is Betrayal at House on the Hill (mentioned earlier). Primarily cooperative, it uses a traitor mechanic that causes one player to unexpectedly betray the party, which sets into motion a story-driven scenario, where both the traitor and the rest of the players have distinct win conditions.To sum up, this is not a good game. There are planty of other good cooperative games to measure this against. The poorly-conceived systems diminish its playability, and its small number of scenarios limit its replayability. I would seriously consider either of the games previously mentioned above this.",2.0,Unsatisfying dungeon crawl game,1287360000,"10 18, 2010",Toys_and_Games,0.0

The tiles and figures add to the theme's feel. Arguably the tiles could have been illustrated with more detail and variety (I'm thinking of Descent's gorgeous tiles), but they're pretty nice and made from a sturdy stock. The figures are fantastic, except for (disappointingly), Vlad himself, who looks the furthest thing from imposing, especially when compared to the bone dragon or any of the heroes. Kinda looks like Seth Green wearing clothes that are too big for him, unfortunately. Gameplay is not terribly complicated but you will have to invest a little time with the rulebook (or fans' youtube videos), especially if you've had no D&D experience. Once you do, the game is immensely fun and satisfying, and the creepy theme really shines (oozes?) through, but I will warn you it is challenging. You will find yourself cheating a bit in the first few games, because you didn't realize you should have done some other action prior but didn't know the game well enough, or just because it's a hard game but you want to go a little further to see what's ahead. For example in the first solo game, the game ends when you finally get to the Secret Staircase. If you're lucky enough to have this tile be at the top of your stack, you're golden. You'll fight a few monsters and win. But more often than not, you'll be turning over tile after tile and the monsters don't stop coming. You'll be wondering where that #$^$^ tile is. If it's near the bottom, you're screwed (and I hope you have enough table space. There are a dozen or so missions, with varying difficulty and objectives and there are even a couple you can download from their website. And like all D&D there's nothing stopping you from making up your own. It's a fantastic game, that's fun with others or even by yourself as you'll discover when you do that first mission just to learn the game.

There are 2 solo adventures included in the adventure book, but it's possible to play each of the characters by yourself as well.  This was very cleverly done - it seems impossible to make total dead ends and the monsters have an order of operation that keeps the person running them from having to make decisions about their activity.  The bosses have some neat abilities that take advantage of this game's unique mechanics. The Encounter cards are sometimes much too harsh, but that's the closest I can come to a criticism of this game.  I highly recommend it.  Also, it comes with minis which are the same ones released in their sets, just not painted.  They are theoretically usable in play of other D&D games beyond this one, perhaps as minions.

You don't need to buy any Dungeons and Dragons rule books or think hard about creating a character for a tabletop gaming experience.  I like to refer to Castle Ravenloft as ""D&D; Light"".  I would also refer to it as a great introduction to the world of Dungeons and Dragons.  The campaigns and scenarios that come with the game are very fun and make full use of all the components.  The real fun comes when you choose to use your included tools to create your own version of the game.  There is absolutely nothing stopping you from adding your own created items, stipulations, encounters, cards, or specific rules for a scenario.  There is nothing forcing you to do so either.  The game can be easy or extremely hard depending on your luck with dice roles or monsters/encounters drawn, as well as the number of players.  In fact, you might want to add stipulations requiring additional monster draws if you have a full party, otherwise the game is rather easy.  A randomized tile drawing system ensures that your dungeon is never the same, even if you play through the same scenario.  It also includes a fog-of-war element that is well conceived.  For players of Dungeons and Dragons, or other board games of this nature, Castle Ravenloft is a little different in the fact that there is no single player driving the nemesis/dungeon master/enemy mechanics.  Every player's turn also governs the intelligence of the monsters that came into play on their previous turns.  The monsters themselves come with their behavior rules listed on the cards, giving you the directions of how they move, when they attack, what attack they use, etc.  The game pieces themselves are of good quality.  Only the skeleton warriors are somewhat frail (I recommend keeping them in the plastic moldings when not in use), though many of the tokens have weapons or features that are prone to bending, but not breaking.

I had my gang of players and we would spent hours and weekends playing whatever RPG we had in front of us, from D&D; to White Wolf to Gurps and beyond.  As I grew older and grew apart from my old friends, my books have gone into storage.  I always want to get back into those games, but my friends, even my geeky ones, don't normally have the patience, drive or desire to really dig into a campaign setting.  And finding the time to both create massive adventures on my part but also finding the discrete amount of time each week or so to sit down and play for a few hours is difficult now.  When I heard about Castle Ravenloft (one of my favorite campaign settings), I immediately perked up.  Here, I thought, was a chance to dig back into the game in a way that wasn't as complicated or time-consuming (or, let's be honest, as geeky) as a full-fledged campaign.  After I ordered it, I became very worried because most of the reviews I've read across the internet have said it's too hard.  I was afraid that it'd turn of my fellow gamers and the box would languish like my 2nd edition D&D; books.Here is my experience after a couple playthroughs:Castle Ravenloft is a huge box.  It dwarfs all other equally large board games I own like Betrayal at House on the Hill and Last Night on Earth.  It also comes with a ton of pieces (a good thing, considering the price of this monster) for you to punch out.  As listed above in the product description, there's dozens of miniatures, an equal amount of interlocking dungeon tiles, around 200 encounter and treasure cards, a rule book, a scenario book (with about a dozen scenarios) and a 20-sided die that I'm pretty sure is out to kill.  What it doesn't explain is the amount of other punchable tiles to indicate hit points, conditions (like slowed and immobile), traps, treasures, monsters, character and ""boss"" stocks (i.e. Strahd) with stats and other assorted items you'll use in the scenarios. I spent a good amount of time punching out the dungeon tiles and the other tiles, skimming the cards and just admiring how awesomely designed the entire thing is.  It's not cheap materials in this box.  Wizards did a terrific job making this stand out, from a workman perspective.  The only complaint I'd level is that the dungeon tiles are kind of mundane.  The art is pretty typical ""dungeon tile"" and lacks flair.The Rulebook is very slim and sometimes ambiguous.  I've read through it a couple times and it took running a game and coming up with house rules to deal with ambiguity to really understand everything.  For example, it mentions the white and black arrows on the dungeon tiles and tells you that if there's a black arrow, you have to draw an encounter card.  But it doesn't tell you what the white arrow means, except that it's the difference between a difficult situation and an easier one.  The implication is that you don't draw an encounter card when the white arrow is there (or, I discovered later, some scenarios explain a specific thing to do if the arrow is white), but it doesn't spell it out.  And it can be confusing the first few times you play through the game.  Likewise, some dungeon tiles have skulls on them and some don't.  I couldn't find in the book exactly what those mean, so we just decided that it meant you had to draw a monster card.  I'm sure there will be an errata online to address the nebulous rules but you'd think that the game you purchased would have the rules clearly laid out.  Sifting through the forums shows that a lot of people have made up house rules to address some of the ambiguity.For our first game, we went with the second scenario (the first scenario is for one player).  It was the most straightforward and presumably easiest: the goal was to locate the chapel, find the Icon of Ravenloft and escape with it.  The game comes with five characters/classes (fighter, wizard, priest, rogue and ranger) and each character has a selection of power cards that they can use once in the game or at will.  Thankfully, the game suggests specific cards if you don't know what you're doing.  We went with those and it was fine.  The game is split into three phases for each player: Hero, exploration and villain.  During the hero phase, you can move a set number of spaces on a tile and/or attack.  If you reach the end of a tile, you draw another dungeon tile and set it down.  The tile will indicate whether you have to draw an encounter card or not and whether to place a monster.  If you have an encounter, you have to draw an encounter card and it'll tell you what to do.  Most of the time, some random monster will attack you or everyone on your tile.  You roll the dice, add their attack to it and see if it's above or below your armor class.  If it's above, you take the damage listed on the card.  If it's below, you either take no damage or, more often than not, take one damage regardless.  Encounters are 90% mean.  You don't want to deal with them.After the encounter, you draw a monster card and place the miniature on the bone pile in the room.  Because the game doesn't have a game master to control the monsters, if you draw the card, it's your monster to control.  Castle Ravenloft intelligently deals with this by using the monster cards.  Each monster has a specific tactic that you use, which follows a ""If the monster is within one tile of you it does this"" or ""if the monster is next to a hero, it does this.""  Some monsters, like gargoyles, won't move if you are over one tile away from them.  But most of them will move towards you and attack.  The difference is which attack they'll use.  As an example, a spider will bite you if it's next to you.  If it's within a tile from you, it'll use its web attack to slow you and then move to you.  If it's over a tile away, it'll simply move towards the closest hero.  Killing the monster means you keep the card which in turn acts as experience points.  Experience points are very important because you can spend five points to cancel out an encounter; or, if you roll a natural 20, you can spend five experience points to go up to level two...obviously this doesn't happen very often.Castle Ravenloft can be a very intense game.  Because there is no game master and in order to prevent heroes from taking their time and just slowly taking care of monsters, waiting around and healing up (using a cleric ability, for example) before continuing on, Ravenloft throws encounters at you with wild abandon.  If you don't explore (reach the end of a tile and place another), you have to draw an encounter card.  Likewise, if you are fighting three monsters and it's not going well (meaning, you can't continue on and explore), you have to draw an encounter card.  This can quickly spike the difficulty and overwhelm you to the point that you won't win.  You only get two healing surges (we played with three, as was recommended in the rulebook for ""lowering the difficulty"") and all of the scenarios end if even one player is dead.  In case it's not evident: Castle Ravenloft is hard and often punishing.  Once you add in traps that can smash you into walls, shoot arrows, or immobilize you among other crazy cards you can pull, your chances of survival seem almost nil.  The game is stacked against you.  That said, we managed to barely survive our first game based on right-timed skills (the fighter's dragon breath at the end which ended up hitting all three monsters and killing them) and luck.  But we had fun the entire time.With twelve wildly different scenarios and two available to download from Wizards' website, there's a lot of replayability in Castle Ravenloft.  I will end with a little anecdote about our first playthrough.  I was playing with two friends.  One had a bit of experience both with computer RPGs and some table top experience.  The other had absolutely no experience.  At the beginning, she just took what power cards were dealt to her, looked them over and said ""I have no idea what any of this means.""  She didn't really care what was going on.  But something interesting happened.  As the game progressed, she grew more and more into it, and at the end when we were faced with three monsters and it looked grim she excitedly and animatedly jumped up, yelling, ""OH! I can use my dragon breath skill and kill them all!"" It made me smile.  While Castle Ravenloft is geared towards pen and paper geeks like myself, it is simple enough that someone who has never played through a module (let alone know what a module is) can pick it up and have a great time.",5.0,A fantastic but incredibly hard game,1290470400,"11 23, 2010",Toys_and_Games,1.0

Used to play D&D; and then AD&D; around twenty years ago. Haven't been involved with any serious groups since then so I have no experience with any editions of D&D; that cause such a rift in the community. This means that I am not hopelessly in love with any specific Edition of D&D.;-Note for various D&D; Edition FanGirls and FanBoys- If you are a 4th Edition Hater and can't get past that, you most likely will not enjoy these games as they are based, in general, on the 4th Edition rule set. If you don't know what that statement means, or if you are capable of enjoying what each Edition has to offer, you should have no problems.Why I love the D&D; Adventure Systems:Castle Ravenloft(CR), Wrath of Ashardalon(WoA) and Legend of Drizzt(LoD): They work as a stand alone product and offer a dungeon crawling, limited leveling, monster slaying experience with no previous knowledge of how D&D; works. And all in sessions that can be finished in an hour or two. The minimal time commitment involved is fantastic.Or, if you find yourself filled with nostalgia and desire a fuller, longer campaign with further leveling options or new characters, these games can be tweaked to allow for that. Especially with some of the user created content online, the photoshop templates on boardgamegeek.com in particular are wonderful. Also this [....]address has a plethora of new content. The extra leveling options are definitely my favorite. The truth is that I screamed in happiness when I ran across them. I sounded like a ten year old girl getting a pony. A unicorn pony. with wings. A Unicorn Pegasus Pony that appeared in a shimmer of rainbow colors. And now I am deeply ashamed...........*sigh* I am such a nerd.The game system totally allows for expandability in many ways. It's kind of a gateway drug for D&D; honestly. I find myself consistently wanting just a bit more of the actual RPG experience. We tweak the game a bit and suddenly our experience is just a bit fuller and more satisfying. Not nearly as detailed and time intensive as an actual D&D; or Pathfinder game though. Such a great balance for us.They don't have to be expanded upon though, to be immensely enjoyable. Any of the three games are enough in and of themselves to be hugely gratifying and offer much re-playability. The expandability is just something that makes them extra cool and versatile in my opinion.All three systems use totally interchangeable materials. Some of the cards may be context sensitive and not seem to fit in a particular environment but other than that you can use everything in each of the games. This provides Awesomeness Bonus of +2.The map tiles and figurines both are an unbeatable value and can be easily incorporated into a ""real"" D&D; session.Everything in the box, other than the manuals, is of superb quality. The figurines alone would easily cost you double what you pay for the set here. And if you paint figurines, which I do, you will have just gained around forty new minis to paint. Joy in and of itself there.Possible Cons:I saw in the review for one of the three games that some dude was just totally disgusted with how these games ""punish"" the players for almost every activity they engage in. The guy was totally a Hater. However, he wasn't necessarily wrong. The game does seem to be constantly throwing things at you that often don't feel fair. Notably, the Encounter cards. Which brings me to the next con and a solution to the ""punishment"" issue....The instruction manual will not answer every question that will come up. It is left up to the players to decide how certain things should work. Which is how a ""real"" D&D; game works. Your group plays the game the way they want to play it. If you simply cannot function without every rule spelled out for you, this may be a problem. Otherwise you'll be fine. And in terms of rule tweaking and the punishment issue- we decided to change how often we draw encounter cards as well as a couple other minor aspects of the game. This has served to make our sessions a lot more fun. Don't be afraid to tweak the rules in order to play the game how you want to play it.The manuals are pretty cheaply put together. They may not hold up well to use by younger players or spilled drinks. I took ours apart and put the pages in plastic binder inserts. We now have all the material for all the games in a single, sturdy, custom decorated notebook. Which is awesome btw. (Disclaimer for claim of awesomeness: I created the custom artwork:)Space. With all the cards and map tiles and bags of monsters and tokens that get used in a typical session, you may find you need a bit more space than an average board game. All of the aforementioned items can quickly end up being a mess. As a solution we have everything securely contained in varying sizes of ziplock bags. Including the map tiles in a 1 Gallon size bag. Perfect for storage and during play.There is no actual role playing or in town scenarios. If you want to get into a brawl over the serving wench's honor at The Yawning Portal Inn in the city of Waterdeep, then you should just find a gaming group and play Pathfinder or D&D;(any Edition). Or perhaps, after stumbling into a gathering of Dirty Orcs in the Gloomy Forest of Gloom and Terror, you want to attempt to use an illusion to convince them you are a deity and sell them into slavery in the Land of Thay. As opposed to just killing them. Again, just go find a full-on game of D&D.; These systems can be worked to allow for things like that to some degree, but they aren't designed to be open world or allow for anything other than a dungeon crawl with combat and a final, combat based, objective.So:If you want ""real"" D&D;, then you may be more satisfied finding a group and getting involved.If you want a game that allows you to engage in D20 based combat, with figurines, that represent a character with minimal leveling capacity. And that can be played by anyone. These systems may be just the thing for you.Also of note: The Dungeon Command games have interchangeable map tiles, monster cards and figurines that can be used seamlessly with the Adventure Systems.

No worries - the cards I got were good enough to make a kick-butt blue/black deck! In all, I was very pleased with the cards I got. My bf's roommate has been playing for more than a decade and he said that I have some really good decks now, which made me really happy with the value of this kit - and its deck-building advice!

The builder ideas and suggestions is mainly a fold-out,no different than what you get in Theme Decks or Fat Packs, but it did help me get a better understanding on how to play with the basic archetypes of Magic Decks and their suggestions on deck types. I managed to build both an Eldrazi Deck and a White/Blue Flyer Deck with other ideas on the horizon.Plus, how often does a booster pack give you a second Progenitus? That was a fun find as I opened the Conflux booster. Plus the assorted cards give you enough spells and land to help construct and complement your current supply of cards and decks.I would recommend this kit as a good expansion set and as an addditional card storage box, since the kit works as a deck case as well. Treat this like a fat pack, but as a good starting place for beginners, and a good card expansion set for mid-to advanced players.",4.0,Solid Set and a Good Deck Building Assistant,1297382400,"02 11, 2011",Toys_and_Games,1.0

Although I prefer the fat packs (see link at bottom), or the boxes with nine packs, a d20 and about 100 lands, they run at about 40 dollars apiece and have less cards in them.  As I had already spent about 60 bucks on fat packs this month (Showcase Comics had a GREAT Valentines sale), I was left with a substantially less amount of disposable moolah.  I saw this, and after reading the reviews, decided to buy it.  I mentioned before how I spent about 60 dollars on fat packs, right?  Well, this box might have surpassed them in the value of cards.  I got a planeswalker, the newest, which is Sorin.  He sells for more than the toolkit is worth.  He is of the highest rarity, as are two other cards I obtained in this pack (Tree of Redemption and primordial hydra).  Overall, I am pleased to the upmost degree with this toolkit, and I've just wasted your time (whoever is reading this) where you could have purchased this toolkit.  Oh and shipping from gohastings was the same day, given the fact that I ordered it late the night before.  It shipped within 24 hours, and got to my door two days before it was due to arrive, which means it was delivered from Arizona to my house in Pennsylvania in five days, including the weekend and President's day, which further narrows my case by two days, as post is not delivered on holidays or Sundays.  So, instead of reading the last sentences of what seems to be a college essay, which is what I really should be working on seeing that it's due in a mere 7 hours, order the toolkit instead.  I hope my review has persuaded you to purchase the item, as I think you will be happy with what you get.

It may not have quite enough for a monocolored 60 card deck, but if it's a monocolored deck, you can always say that your islands are actually mountains.2. A lot of good staples in both commons and uncommons show players some of the best simple cards made for the game.3. Perhaps the best part is that due to the semi-random nature of the toolkits, the designers have made sure to create a few different 'archetypes' rather than just a random sampling of cards where making a theme deck would be difficult.  A new player could try a big creature green deck, a mana ramp deck, a black discard deck, a red direct damage deck, a combat tricks - small creature white deck, etc... Additionally, since each theme isn't present in every deck builder's toolkit, if two new players have separate toolkits, they can be surprised by what the other person has.4.

You do not need to own or have plaid Ravenloft to play and enjoy this game.  In fact, I consider this a superior product.First and foremost it comes with a wide variety of plastic miniatures, these are the same soft minis they release for their separate miniatures line meaning they won't chip or break, but also are unsuitable for traditional miniature painting.  They are unpainted, but the plastic color for each is chosen to denote the power and theme of the monster (red for demons, grey for duergar and so forth).The artwork on the tiles is well done, and the tiles themselves are solidly constructed.  There is a huge variety of tokens and cards for all situations in the game, these are all competently put together.  If I had to pick 1 complaint, and it would be minor, it is that there are too many different varieties of tokens, and unless you put together some sort of sorting mechanism (plastic baggies work fine) it's easy to get the things you are looking for lost in a pile of tokens.Gameplay starts by choosing a scenario from the included booklet, which includes everything you need to know to set up this particular adventure.  The scenarios increase in difficulty as you go along, but do not require continuity to play, so if you have a favorite you can jump right there.  Everybody plays, there is no person running this game for the players, it is entirely player driven.  Exploration occurs by drawing random tiles, which are accompanied by monsters and random encounters.One fun touch are environment cards which are ambient effects that remain in play until another is drawn.  These range from an increase in the number of monsters drawn to walls of magma.  Players control the monsters they place, which are driven by simple scripts telling you what they do in clearly defined situations (if they are far away, move them up, if they are near attack, etc, etc.)The rules system will be very familiar to anybody who has played 4th edition D&D;, but simple enough for newcomers to grasp.  Once the game gets going, it quickly cascades giving a real feel of desperation without becoming unmanageable.  The random encounters and events are fairly well balanced, and I found this to be a solid game.Plays between 1 and 5.",5.0,A Solid Follow Up to Castle Ravenloft,1298332800,"02 22, 2011",Toys_and_Games,1.0

Paid list value, but supporting local game stores helps keep them in business, and it's a rough market to keep a gaming store running. Also, I do not own, nor have I playedDungeons & Dragons: Castle Ravenloft Board Game, the first D&D; Adventures Board Game. Regardless...Dungeons & Dragons: Wrath of Ashardalon Board Game (WoA) is a fantastic value at $65 (list). You get 42 (plastic, unpainted) minis (1"" scale), you get a nice set of cardboard interlocking(!) dungeon tiles, and you get a fun, very random, board game playable either by yourself or with up to 4 friends.What it is:WoA is, in gamer terms, a roguelike in tabletop form. In layman's terms, WoA is a dungeon crawler. You start at the entrance, and have a specific goal (rescue the villagers, survive the dungeon, destroy the altar, slay the dragon). The adventures are built randomly based on shuffling the tiles, and they are played individually as you explore. You can go for a massive linear dungeon based on a little luck and careful planning, or you can attempt to condense yourself in a larger swarm interconnected tunnels.Some of the adventures feature ""chambers"", special larger rooms that are all placed at once and filled with enemies and a specific goal that the team must complete to win the adventure.It's a great way to introduce someone into tabletop roleplaying gaming, it's the perfect medium between a board game and an actual pen and paper RPG.It's a fun, quick* game to run a quick adventure for some friends taking anywhere between 20 minutes and an hour per adventure.What it isn't:A deeper roleplaying game with a full interconnected series of quests over a grand campaign.A completely accurate representation of 4th edition Dungeons & Dragons rules.Overly complicated (as most roleplaying games will seem to be for most people.)What's in the box:* 42 plastic heroes and monsters* 13 sheets of interlocking cardstock dungeon tiles* 200 encounter and treasure cards* Rulebook* Scenario book* 20-sided dieMiniatures:The game includes 42 minis, including 7 villan, 5 hero, and 30 monsters. The minis are of nice quality. They're clearly just mass produced, but they put some effort into modeling them, just not so much into trimming the leftover plastic in places. Some of the swords will be bent from being in the box. And they're unpainted. However, I don't mind the unpainted state, and I plan on using them during D&D; Encounters I'm DMing at a local store. The Ashardalon figurine is very detailed, my *only* (and the only real) gripe is that none of them are painted.4/5Cardstock Dungeon Tiles:They're one of the nicest parts of the set. They're very high quality, the art is nice, and the interlocking design can't be beat. Purchasers of D&D; Dungeon Tiles will know how hard they are to keep together without tape, these lock together like puzzle pieces. Wouldn't be hard to use them in a real D&D; game, except for the fact that they're somewhat limited, and they're not large open spaces. There are a lot of tokens and HP markers and other things all made out of the same cardstock (including cards for the Villans, your big bad guys, and the Heroes)5/5200 Encounter, Monster & Treasure cardsThese are drawn during the different phases of the game (there are 3), and they certainly add to the randomness of the game. Everything scales nicely so that you can attempt to run the party adventures solo and it'll still work nicely.5/5Rulebook:The rulebook is the only real downfall I've seen of the box set. It does an alright job at conveying the basics, but other questions I have are just non-existant. Can I spend a healing surge without being dead just to heal? The book itself has card errata on the back page, which is crazy. Other than that, it's not a bad rulebook for being only 15 pages.3.5/5Scenario Book (""Adventure Book"")This has 13 adventures to run using the set, each of them varying based on how things shuffled, what magic items get drawn and if there's a chamber, what chamber card gets drawn. The adventures essentially play themselves as you follow the turn orders. There's very little fluff for each of the adventures, but that's what make it D&D;, you get to set your own motivation for the adventure, your own background. It's enough to get you going, and you let your imagination take it from there.4.5/520 sided dieAKA, the d20. THE iconic D&D; symbol. You roll it, add a modifier and compare it to a set number. That's pretty much it. It's just as nice as the D&D; Red Box dice or any chessex dice I've bought. But it's just a d20, nothing special. Nice if you don't have any, throw it in the bag with all your others.5/5Overall, I would have liked to see more adventures (that's not to say more aren't coming, the official ones available at time of review require Castle Ravenloft as well, which I don't have yet.) There's only one ""solo"" adventure, but I played through it and adventure 5 solo. Not sure if a single player could take on Ashardalon himself, but half the fun is seeing how well you can do.I actually wouldn't mind running a full D&D; campaign with similar designs; it's a perfect format for a Megadungeon delve, it's fast, and it's exciting due to the randomness. I'm glad the cards aren't collectable, there's 200, that's all there is.All in all, if you're into RPGs, or if you've ever wondered if a Roguelike could work in a tabletop format, it can, and it's called Wrath of Ashardalon.*Edit* I forgot to mention, the initial setup (punching out the cards) takes a considerable amount of time. Like close to 20 minutes.

I'll break down all of the great highlights:Set-Up------You divide out cards and characters. You put a start tile down, then you're ready to go. Super easy and fast.Rules-----If you are familiar with playing Dungeons and Dragons, then you'll know that an encounter can often take more than an hour. Not so here.The rules have been laid out to make encounters very brief. And you won't feel cheated. All of the rolls are with 20-sided dice. Damage is 1, 2 or 3 hit points. Almost everything has between 1-12 hit points. So creature die fast.Each player adds more of a challenge. So if you solo, it's just as hard as with 5 people (more or less -- I think it's just a tad harder with more people). So as you add more people, their ability to play their role becomes crucial (fighters fight, clerics heal, wizards blast from afar, etc).The rules roughly follow the 4.0 version of the Dungeons and Dragons rules. You have daily, utility and at-will powers. Swinging a sword is at-will, blasting something with a powerful fireball is daily.You collect experience as you kill creatures. If you kill something with a roll of 20 and you have 5 experience points in monsters, then you can level up your character to gain more hit points, less chance of being hit and more powers.Quests are found in a quest book that tells you how to set up the game and who the boss is. The end of most quests have a boss that will take a lot to kill.Durability----------The game is very well made. The plastic is hard enough to not break after thorough use. The cardboard pieces are very dense and thick.Our cards warped a little one a humid night, but it wasn't horrible.Nerd-Factor-----------This game had far less nerdness than regular D&D.; But it also doesn't have some of the fun aspects of role-playing (like a long, emmersive and interactive storyline). You can feel safe to invite people over to play who are not Dungeons & Dragons addicts.Minitaures----------All of the pieces are very detailed. Some look identical to the D&D; 4.0 creatures and characters that are sold for the miniatures game. However, none of these pieces are painted. They are all one solid (or translucent) color.Fun Factor----------Since the game has no need for a Dungeon Master or someone to play the enemy, everyone can enjoy playing on the same team. And you'll rarely have mathematical discussions of how to absolutely maximize every turn in order to survive (a common occurance in many other dungeon crawls, e.g. Descent:  Journey into the Darkness).So, overall, it's just a good time with a bunch of friends. Win or lose, you'll enjoy the comraderie of tearing through baddies and collecting treasure.Replayability-------------The game offers tons of quests and there's practically in infinite number more online. You could also just make up your own quests. The randomization of encounter and treasure cards keeps things changing. And you can add more heroes, treasure cards, encounter cards and quests by purchasing Ravenloft or the coming Legends of Drizzt board game.Overall-------This is the best dungeon crawl game I've ever played. I find it difficult to imagine something working out better.Admittedly, I enjoyed this game even more when I played with the cards from Ravenloft added into it. Some of the skills in this game don't synergize very well together, but they do with the Ravenloft game.

There are plenty of times where I'd like to play but no one is available to play. Single or multi player, it seems to be a solid game.My only complaints are that the punch out tiles seem to be a BIT less of quality when compared to other big box games like Descent Second Edition. I noticed when I was punching out the tiles, there was a lot of debris on the table. Maybe a poor cut in the sheet, but annoying in any event. They also are prone to tearing if you aren't careful when taking them out. But once they are punched out, they seem to be pretty solid. The playing cards are also a bit thinner than other games. Not too big of a deal since most players buy sleeves for all their cards, so that I can live with. Lastly, the adventure book and rule book are pretty flimsy.The minis are of great quality and there are a lot of them. Wizards of the Coast never disappoints in this department IMHO.All in all, if the punch outs are carefully taken out and the cards and books are stored properly, there should be no issue.For a sale price of $38, I couldn't pass this up, but I would be VERY hesitant to pay full blown retail price.Definitely worth picking up for solo adventures or a good solid game night.",4.0,Great dungeon crawler with a few minor complaints.,1372982400,"07 5, 2013",Toys_and_Games,1.0

If that seems too obvious to be worth stating, read on.Like probably millions of other aging geeks, I have fond memories of loooong nights at the game table with friends in high school and college, roleplaying until our eyes bled. But now I have a real job and a family and I'd be lucky to get a group together monthly for half an evening. So I was pretty excited when I saw Wrath of Ashardalon, because I was hoping that it would deliver the sugar high of a good dungeon crawl without the prep work or running time of the RPGs I used to play.Now, in its defense, the game does pretty well. The bits are very nice, the rules are mostly clear, and the DM-less play works okay. It's not perfect. Occasionally you may run into situations you have to house-rule. I'm okay with that, but YMMV.This game is sort of the epitome of Ameritrash (and I say this fondly, as someone contemplating buying a 3rd version of Risk): loads of theme, loads of violence, and loads--LOADS--of randomness. I realize that's part and parcel here, but it really sucks to work your way into a great (or at least survivable) tactical position and then watch your carefully hoarded powers and hit points disappear in a flurry of bad rolls (come to think of it, that sucks in Risk, too).One thing I did not expect is that the game can drag on for hours. Except for a few special powers, no-one can kill more than one monster per turn, but you often get one monster per turn. Several of the encounter cards grow the dungeon for you whether you want them to or not, which keeps adding monsters. Then there are sentry monsters, which can open up new areas and thereby bring more monsters into the game. More than once we've had to retreat to a narrow hallway, bottleneck the ghastlies, and just pray we could mow 'em down before we got Walls of Magma. But if you're careful, and a bit lucky, you can just barely stay alive by clever use of powers, especially if you have the cleric and the paladin in play to keep healing folks. Again, part and parcel--""stay alive until you just barely win (or just barely lose)"" ought to be the definition of suspenseful, dungeon-crawly satisfaction. But in actual practice it feels more like, ""stay alive until the dice finally kill you (or fail to)"".At which point you may think, ""why am I playing this instead of an actual RPG? I could use all the same bits, do all the same stuff, take just as much time, and have more options and more fun?""So, in the end, that's what I did. This game drove me back to roleplaying games, first by tricking me into feeling like I was playing one for a while, and then by grossly running over its stated duration of play on more than one occasion. WoA is just what it says on the tin, a boardgame rather than a roleplaying game, and it is certainly cleverly done and has high production values. I like it.

I also played Dungeons and Dragons role playing game when I was younger.  Unfortunately, now my group of adult friends are not into role playing games so I picked up Wrath of Ashardalon with hopes that it'd be enjoyable to both experienced gamers and those who aren't.Success.  Last night I played my first game with a group of my friends and we all had a very fun time, even though we lost.  This game is easy to learn, and fast paced so there aren't a lot of complex rules to have to remember.  One thing that we all enjoyed about this game is the fact that everyone works together as a team (as opposed to most board games) which I believe makes it an even better choice for children and younger gamers.  One thing to keep in mind however, is that the game can be difficult.  There are optional rules for making the game less challenging, which should be considered if you are playing with younger children.  For us adults, we still had fun even though we lost.  After losing we would discuss our ""tactics"" and how to do things better.  We would then generally setup the board and immediately try again.As I said before the rules are pretty simple, but there are some situations where the rules might be unclear.  Usually we solved with with common sense, and deciding as a group what should happen.  But these situations were rare and didn't effect our gaming session in a negative way.One thing to keep in mind however, that this is a board game... not a D&D; role playing game.

Wrath of Ashardalon streamlines the entire process, simplifies the rules, and makes the game mechanics very clear.  Although I did need to look up a few rules clarifications on a couple of FAQs, it was easy to dive right in with a couple of friends and start playing immediately.I can completely understand why veteran D&D; players might be disappointed with this game, but I would propose that a veteran player could simply change the rules and add in whatever elements from the core D&D; rulebook he or she wanted to use (including a DM) and simply treat this as a dungeon building/scenario pack with options for streamlining where desired.  That's my plan at least as I have a fun time using this game to ease myself into full-blown D&D; at my own pace.I'm more of a video game player, and to use an example from the video game world, take the classic game Civilization and its sequels.  You could play a full game that could take more than one day to finish, and sure it was a lot of fun.  However, Civilization Revolutions was later released as a streamlined, faster paced version of the classic, and I really enjoyed it as much as the original because sometimes I just didn't feel like committing many hours to a single game.  My impression is that Wrath of Ashardalon is to D&D; as Civilization Revolutions is to Civilization.  One key difference of course is that you can adjust the amount of streamlining in Wrath of Ashardalon to make it as involved or not as a full-blown D&D; adventure based on your personal preference.",5.0,fun game,1306195200,"05 24, 2011",Toys_and_Games,1.0

My two kids (13 & 15) and  I have not been able to stop playing since we got this.  The game requires no &#34;Dungeon Master&#34; and it pits you and your friends against the dungeon beasts.  Several scenarios can be chosen to launch the game, and these varying in difficulty and duration.  We found that the first two scenarios were more about learning the flow of the game, but things really got fun in the third scenario (first one that used the chamber tiles).The game comes with predetermined heroes, from which each player chooses.  Each has unique abilities, with cards to remind you of the damage, healing or characteristic of abilities.  The dungeon is created from tiles that are randomly selected as the game progresses.  Each dungeon tile explored has either a random monster, random encounter, or both.  Monsters are &#34;handled&#34; by the player that drew them, but they come with an attack strategy.  While the monster cards are not that great to look at, they do give a fairly detailed attack strategy that allows the player to determine which hero the monster attacks or other actions a monster may do (ex. Kobolds love to go looking for help from their friends).  The monster and hero figures are high quality, but are unpainted.  If you desire to paint the figures, do some web searching and you will quickly find a vast community of gamers willing to help you.  My kids and I were ecstatic to find that our monsters from the Dungeon Command series were compatible with WoA.  Mixing our monster cards from Dungeon Command into the monster deck from WoA makes things even more challenging.  There's nothing more intimidating than revealing you chamber monsters and realizing you have to face an Ogre and a Dracolich, along with the baddies already in play.I do have a few minor complaints.  The box is IMPRESSIVE and high quality.  The choice of heroes is a bit strange, and I wish they'd included male and female version of both.  The instructions manuals are printed on thin paper, and given the extremely high quality of the other components, they definitely should have made the manuals more durable.  The artwork on the monster cards is boring compared to those from the Dungeon Command series.  I wish they would have made the treasures that Increase Armor Class or Attack &#34;stackable&#34;, so that they were easier to keep track of (as in Dungeon Command).  I may mark my cards along the bottom edge to serve this purpose.Overall, this is a GREAT game, and well worth the purchase price.  It has given us hours of enjoyment and quality time together, untethered from our electronic devices.  The game lends itself to customization of monster sets allowing the utilization of monsters from other D&D; sets (i.e., Dungeon Command).

Once we adjusted to the scant rulebook in CR (it was very alarming to make up house rules when we were new to the genre), we found the game to be fun and engaging, and it made sense to try out the second version.  WoA shows some obvious improvements over CR.  We found that the health and monsters are balanced better, though it's hard to put my finger on exactly what changed to make it so.  However, in CR, we basically always had to add a house rule for possible health drops after defeating an enemy (we would roll the D20 to determine whether health would or would not drop and then again for how much).  In WoA, we don't have to do that, and we still win often enough to make the game fun and not just punishment.Now that we have played real D&D;, this game feels a little bit weaker.  I see now the depth that I'm missing here, and it's true that actual role playing is hard.  However, I don't think it's fair to blame this game for being watered down D&D.;  In fact, I think it's basically marketed to be that way.  By and large, we don't have time for a full D&D; campaign with weekly meetings that last for hours at a time.  When those sessions happen, they are more fun than playing WoA or CR, but they don't happen very often.  In the mean time, this provides the opportunity to use all of that magnificent dungeon-crawling lingo and to experience the agony of peaking around a dark corner and finding a cave bear waiting for you.Overall, I would say that, in many ways, this is a strategy game couched in the slick skin of an RPG.  My husband and I like to work hard to optimize our plans and order our strategies to have the best run-through.  When we play the game with a full party of friends, much chaos and laughter ensue (because, let's face it, five turns per round produce a LOT of monsters and encounter cards).

I remember the sense of vague foreboding conjured by RPG-like board games such as Runequest and Spacehulk. I had read some favorable reviews of the new ""RPG-as-boardgame"" series promoted by Wizards on the Coast, and I was excited to try this. I splunked down my hard-earned cash and amazon duly delivered a hefty box of dreams to my doorstep.Wrath of Ashardalon and I had some good times initially. My friends and I gamely punched all the cardboard pieces out of the sprues. We love punching pieces out of sprues! It inspires a sense of childlike wonder and anticipation in us! This tile has a Horrid Chamber on it! That dungeon tile has dead bodies! Ooh, I wonder what a flaming sphere does? These cards all have various powers and spells on them! Look, you can play a dragon character! And the plastic figurines were enjoyable, similar to those plastic dinosaurs we all had as kids. Whee!Sadly, that was the best part of the game. Everything went downhill when we actually started to play.The game itself is a reductionist vision of a dungeon crawl. It is, unfortunately, so reductionist that is effectively a game of Munchkin, but without a sense of humor. I think the game designers must have sensed this, and to try to add a sense of danger and urgency to the game, they created a deck of sadistic Encounter cards to punish us for playing. (But more about those later.)The players progress through the dungeon together. At every unexplored edge, they ""kick down the door"" and grow the dungeon by one (1) new dungeon tile, guaranteed to contain exactly one (1) new monster, and possible an Encounter card (which is invariably unpleasant). This game might have been interesting if every new corner of the dungeon had produced a novel challenge for the players to make strategic decisions about together. Instead, the players typically have one power which is the min-max best option for any given monster, and they use it, over and over again. The twenty-sided die is rolled. The monster advances. It does a hit point of damage to the wizard! And then it dies. And drops a treasure.It's difficult to be heroic in this game. The characters are punished for pushing forward into the darkness. They are also punished for standing still. They are punished for gathering together on one tile, and they are punished for spreading out. There are precious few strategic decisions to be made in this game.All of this is incredibly tedious and dull. I magic missile the darkness.The power cards feel poorly thought out, poorly worded, and disappointing. The ""Hypnosis"" card, seems promising: it can cause one monster to attack another! My goodness, a card that allows the players to turn the dungeon against itself! Strategy! But no. Unlike the Scroll of Monster Control item, which replaces a monster's attack on the players, Hypnosis simply supplements the monster's action with it's ""hypnotized"" attack. But can the power at least let the players turn the Cave Bear's awesome Claws attack against the Kobold horde? No, not really. The monster's attack is reduced to a standardized ""Attack +9, Damage 1,"" as printed on the card. Really, this card is a +9, 1 damage attack that only works if two monsters are in the same room. Is this what the game designers intended? Who knows! But hey, that's what it says on the card.If the player's powers are boring, at least the game designers also gave us Encounter cards. We scrubbed through the rules multiple times, certain we were misinterpreting them. But no: every player will typically draw at least one encounter card every turn. Thus, a four-player band of characters fighting a monster will typically draw four encounter cards every round of combat. Sadly, the encounter cards aren't terribly creative. They all seem to be variants of ""Random thing happens! And everybody takes a point of damage."" Your band of fearless heroes has just spent a turn vanquishing a kobold, and you're feeling pretty good about it. But wait, you turn isn't over until you draw an Encounter card. Oops! The room you're in just turned into a pit! Most of the players fall into it. You do the heroic thing and stay in the room with the pit to help your friends climb out. But lo, on the next turn the pit rolls to attack again and sucks you in!Many of the encounter traps seem more malevolent that is actually necessary. The spinning ball of blade trap will follow you from room to room. The walls turn to magma! But on the next turn the magma reverts to stone while an alarm sounds, alerting the orcish horde to our presence! A cage falls on your head! Poisonous gas fills the room! It's so zany! The Encounter cards prove to be far more lethal than any monster encountered in the dungeon. The players will come to dread having to take their turn.We were certain that we missed some part of the game on our first run-through. Maybe we were playing it wrong. Maybe we had misinterpreted the rules. So we played it through a second time, and lo: the game as written is truly terrible. At least, we knew that with a few rule changes, we could fix this game. Instead of making the monsters and traps follow unrealistic instructions printed on cards, we decided it would be better to designate one of our number of administrate all the monsters. And, instead of using the limited characters provided with the game (and, no doubt, soon-to-be-available expansion packs), we would create our own characters ourselves. And, instead of plastic figurines and delightful cardboard squares, we would use our imaginations.The game is much more fun that way.",2.0,a disappointing co-op game,1305504000,"05 16, 2011",Toys_and_Games,0.0

First off this is not close to the book version of D&D; that I used to play years ago, it's a simplify board game version, your character can only level up to two, and go on short adventures.The board game has many cards, tokens, figures and tiles.  So if you have small children you may want them somewhere else when playing because little hands likegetting into stuff. You get an easy to follow user hand book and an adventure book.Gameplay can take over an hour plus, it all depends on how many players you have and what adventure you are playing.  This is pretty much a pure dungeon crawler so if you looking for something else like a storyline or true roleplaying this isn't the game for you. Many part of this dungeon crawler is random, like placing down the tiles and picking monster to fight, so difficulty depends on luck of the draw than anything else. Combat is very easy, just role a 20 sided dice and add any hit modifier to your role to hit, if the total is higher than the monster AC then you hit. You should be able to learn the rule after the first adventure.

Having played a lot of Dungeon and Dragons Miniatures 2.0 [DDM 2.0] 'til it died in 2008 [and kept alive via fans and members of the design team, some of whom worked on CR and Wrath of Ashardalon [WoA] and enjoyed D&D; and AD&D; from the original Gygax offerings thru 4th Edition, I wasn't sure if this self-contained boardgame would offer enough entertainment variety for me and my fantasy RPG combat-heavy loving friends. Having read all of the positive reviews on Amazon as well as other sites including ars technica and mtv.com of all places, I felt as if I was duty bound to acquire this game for some reason. The main draw for me was that it contained additional elements beyond what was offered in CR [which again, I hadn't played].Once I received WoA, I couldn't have been happier that I took the plunge! The quality of the gamepieces and punchout tiles and tokens are top notch. The last time I purchased a boardgame was September of 2009 when Games Workshop re-released their latest anniversary edition of Space Hulk; that was an exceptional product overall and cost $100. D&D;: WoA felt nearly equal in quality once I removed everything from the confines of its ginormous box; pretty good for something that cost less than $50 via Amazon.com!I've played several of the included adventures with people whose ages ranged from 8 (my eldest son) to 38, some with boardgame or RP/miniatures skirmish based experience and some with none at all; it was very easy to introduce the rules to all of them and in every instance we all had a great time. Some of the people I 'snookered' into playing this were sold on the concept that they would essentially be playing a tangible, 3-D ver. of the classic game 'Gauntlet' or Rogue-like dungeon crawlers that are still popular today [on phones or the DS/PSP, etc.]. It's greatest strength is probably due to the fact that it's a co-operative game; we all definitely enjoyed the pressure of meeting the required goals and succeeding at them, yet also each having the ability to deter us all from completing those goals due to every Encounter card draw or Monster/Villain action per player's turns.I've since received D&D;: Castle Ravenloft as a gift, and have come to enjoy that tremendously as well.

I first bought Legend of Drizzt (easiest of the three) and found it to be a superb dungeon romp. Castle Ravenloft is brutal, a meatgrinder. WOA takes the middle ground, for the most part. There are times where something leads to multiple monsters spawning at one time. If you are playing two-player or solo, this will wear you down. One scenario calls for you to take out 12 monsters. Sounds simple, right? It would be simple, except that Ashardalon's card is in that deck, too.

The dungeon floor tiles are nice and can also be used to generate random dungeons for tabletop AD&D.; Also, the Dungeon Command game sets can be integrated into these adventure series games. Simply take the cards provided, shuffle them into your game monster deck. BAM! New monsters to torment you.

I also live in a rural area where finding people to game with is difficult, especially for people who like something more than party games. Furthermore, I have been really tired of video games and wanted to play some board games as a break from all that.I stopped playing D&D; when I was a teenager, because some idiot would ultimately become the strongest player/character thus intimidating other players and then turning on everyone either killing them, or making them his slave during game play. I eventually quit because I was so unhappy with these confrontations. No matter who the group was, these negative effects seem to occur.Recently I have been quite interested in the new D&D; board games that have been produced by ""Wizards of the Coast"". After watching many reviews on youtube, I decided to take a leap and buy ""The Wrath of Ashardalon"". I like the idea there is no dungeon master and you could play this solo.Box Opening/First Impressions:My first impressions upon opening the box was that of a kid at Christmas, with lots of beautiful pieces. Dungeon tiles, to amazing artwork on the cards, very nice looking rule book, etc etc. The figures could be used for your regular D&D; games and are high quality for plastic models.All the components are sturdy and well made which should stand up over time.Game Play:I have played many scenarios and I would prefer a bit more narrative. They give you the overall game feel about a village needing help from a dragon and then there is a few sentences about the scenario you have chosen, but not much more.However, I am a bit disappointed. ""TWoA"" seemed rather simplistic; draw a monster card, move, kill, deal with a ""encounter trap"", rinse and repeat. You don't really gain much XP, treasure or much for killing monsters, traps or any other deed. I have heard this game was BASED upon the 4th Ed. D&D; rules. Much of the game play was simplified as well. I guess this is my concern and I have tried to remedy this with some alterations.Playing games like World of Warcraft and Skyrim has made my idea of what a fantasy gaming should be? Because in many video games there is much more to do to keep you vested.I know I can hear some people say, that there are other scenarios like ""rescuing villagers"", but really the different scenarios are much the same. I have heard you can use other pieces and elements from the other D&D; board games.... but... I just wish there was more depth here.I have been altering the game to make it more flavorful and interesting like making more Encounter cards. I have taken the 3 good cards in that deck and made more of them (treasure, healing potion). Thus making the characters deal with more than just being attacked at every corner. I also have bought real metal coins for treasure so the ""clinking"" sound of loot makes it more fun. I plan more altering in the future to keep the game fresh and fun.In Summary:As Tom Vasel (from the Dice Tower) said in one of his game reviews, ""people often don't like games due to their preconceived ideas they have or what they wish a game would be""... and I would generally agree with that. I do enjoy this game and I appreciate the quality of the game pieces and artwork.

I have been after this game for some time now, and it was well worth the long LONG wait!

Sadly this true. It does'nt take away from the game at all, but it is somewhat annoying. It is easily fixed however. Some people have glued them and they hold together well.Also, a good paint job will help the flags better stick to the pole and when it is hardend it makes the soldiers feel more durable. Not to mention adding even more life to the game.The details say it includes 122 miniatures with 61 for each side, but while I was setting up, I noticed that there were more union infantry that confederate. In fact there is 1 odd man out who I just use as a generals aid. It may just be an error on the manufacturer.

One player commands the Confederates while the other commands the Union.  The board is divided up into three sections- the center and the flanks.  Various units- infantry, cavalry, artillery, and generals- populate the board according to each scenario.  Players play cards which tell them on which section of the board they can move units for attack.  Players then roll dice and whichever symbol pops determines if an enemy takes a hit or is forced to retreat.  Each scenario is based upon an actual historical battle such as Shiloh or Antietam, and terrain hexes are placed upon the board to recreate the battlefield.  From the same designer, this is a very similar system to &#34;Memoir '44&#34; and &#34;BattleLore,&#34; though of course the historical theme differs.

We have been big fans of the Memoir '44 board game for years now, and this is very similar in rules, albeit different given the era battles it represents.What has surprised me is how much this game has kindled an interest in the Civil War for my son.  He now checks out Civil War books from the school library frequently, and at a recent book fair, gravitated to a few history books about Abraham Lincoln and Tecumseh Sherman.  He has even tried his hand at re-creating a few scenarios for the game pulled straight from his own history books.  Since its built on C&C; rules, you can't fully recreate all battle scenarios.  But enough to at least get the 'flavor' right.  So in that regards, this game is almost a form of edu-tainment.I've only one gripe about the set, and its one that has been repeated by others.  The little sticky flags are awful. They fall off all the time.  You'll need to invest in some super glue and spend an hour or so re-applying them.  Better yet, use the glue when you first put them on to save yourself the hassle of having to re-apply them later.  The flags add a lot of color to an otherwise ""dingy"" looking game (tan, blue and gray are the predominant colors obviously).  The flags also give you good sight representation of battle scenarios, so you'll definitely want to keep them looking good.But overall, a great addition to our gaming night rotation.",5.0,Great historical choice for Commands and Colors series,1384214400,"11 12, 2013",Toys_and_Games,1.0

Carpenter,"[16, 17]","I found this little gem to be a great game!It is simple enough to be learned and played quickly, yet detailed and versital enough to start and stay interesting. The game is definitely an abstraction of Civil War tactics, so if you're into minutea and detail-like Squad Leader, you probably won't care for this game too much. But, if you can stomach the idea of relatively unit sizes (the rule book states that in some scenarios the units can represent regiments, but in larger scenarios those same units can represent entire divisions) and scope of battlefield, you'll probably like this game. While it is somewhat simple, I still think it does a good job of capturing the essence of being a Civil War Battlefield commander. And if you're a history buff, the scenarios all have a quick historical background.Let's open the box, shall we? The pieces are pretty detailed but the plastic is soft enough that the rifles and flag poles won't snap very easy, yet they're not so ""bendy-wendy"" that the pieces are poor quality. The poses are pretty cool, I think, especially the Cavalry. I think if you're the kind of gamer who likes to paint your game pieces, you'll probably like these, but you will need primer (see my comments on flags sticking below).The only bad thing are the flag stickers for the guidon bearers. The stickers themselves are good quality, but they don't stick to the plastic too well. My solution was to use some Lock Tite super glue. I placed a drop on the flag poles and slid the flags down (after folding) on the poles. Some of the flags still came loose after the first try. But after using a bit more glue, they seem to be holding well. Another note about the flags; I found the best way to fold them around the poles was to match up the opposite ends, stick them together, leave a gap to slide over the poles. I would recommend folding them first before gluing, if you decide to glue. This will likely minimize any mess.The rule book is actually quite thick, but the rules only cover only about 16 pages, most of which, is ""air"". You could probably condense the rules into about 6 or 7 pages. You do need to read them carefully though. While the rules are relatively simple, there are some subtle, yet very important details you can miss easily. However, once caught, they're pretty easy to commit to memory (like the use of the term ""ordered units""). The rest is all battles/scenarios. It is a good quality glossy paper with lots O diagrams and illustrations.The game board and cardboard tokens are very good quality with sharp artwork. The game also comes with a tray at the bottom of the box to store all of your pieces in, sorted out nicely.The dice are great in that rather than having numbers or pips, they have symbols of the different unit types, flags and cross sabers. This simplifies the rules greatly as you only need to reference the dice to see what units your guys hit-no charts or conversions or anything like that. Even my 4 year old son was able to read them correctly. So, if you're looking to get your little ones into the awesome world of wargaming, this game would be a great start.First time wargamers will probably be very pleased with both the contents and the rules. Veteran wargamers might be a little disappointed at first as the game might seem very limited and it is. However, after playing the game a few times, I found that the board, while generic, can be made to fit almost any battlefield with the supplemental terrain pieces. Additionally, the wealth of starting scenarios will give most people quite a lot to start off with before the game becomes stale.All of my ratings were relative to other wargames. I gave the ""fun"" and ""overall"" rating five stars because of the entertainment potential for the largest possible audience. I also gave the ""educational"" value 5 stars because I think this would be a great way for the maximum amount of otherwise disinterested people to learn about ""God Bless American History"". 4 stars for durability-the cardboard, while good stock, is not laminated and if a 4 year old gets a hold of your pieces, you can say good bye to all of your flags and rifle barrels-the plastic isn't that ""bendy-wendy"".I would caution veteran wargamers not to expect too much. This doesn't seem to be designed for the grognards. I would rate the complexity of this game somewhat above the newer versions of Risk, but still as replayable as Axis and Allies. If you like your games complex like Third Reich or a screaming game of A&A-Global-1940-with-1-million-house-rules;, you probably won't care for this game. But, if you're  wargamer who's looking for something light, or someone who wants an entertaining, asthetically pleasing game for a couple hours in the afternoon, bust out the Sam Adams because you'll probably enjoy this game.

Sparks,"[4, 4]","I bought this game because the 150th Anniversary update included the Battle of Prairie Grove, where my Great-Great-Grandfather fought, and I was interested in ""recreating"" the battle to see what might, or might not, have happened ""if"". [For an excellent book on Prairie Grove, I recommendFields of Blood: The Prairie Grove Campaign (Civil War America).]Each battle scenario is mapped out for you in the instruction book, with terrain, building, and troop placements all specified. Each side is given a number of ""Command Cards"" and the instructions designate which player takes the first turn.Each side has Infantry, Cavalry, and Artillary - as well as Generals and flag bearers. The goal in each scenario is dictated by the rule book, and is based upon the 30 different Civil War Scenarios presented.The ""Command Cards"" determine whether the left flank, centre, or right flank is commanded - and how many units in that area are commanded. You can go from a mere ""scouting"" party, to a full frontal attack - if you have and use the right card. The need for a certain type of ""Command Card"" gives the game an unpredictability that is truly a part of warfare, as do the use of dice rolls to determine the outcome of particular engagements.I found the game both enjoyable and educational. I have learned a lot about strategy, tactics, consequences, and the various battles.I do find the rules a bit ""weak"" in some areas, and have modified a couple of them:1) The game allows that even if only 1 unit is present in a hex, it is still at ""full strength"" and can destroy four or more enemy units. I have modified this so that an army can defeat only the number of units it has present.2) The game does not allow you to split units which are together in one hex. This is unrealistic, as units were split all the time. I have made it so that I can send two units off in one direction, and two in another, if I so choose.3) The game does not allow you to combine units, so if you have only 1 unit left in one hex, and 1 unit left in another hex, they have to remain separated. In reality, this doesn't happen, as units often combined, and in the heat of combat, units often were completely mixed up with other units. I have modified this so that isolated units can combine.4) The game places all pieces who were involved in the battle on the gameboard at the start of the game, without regard for ""when"" they became involved. For instance, at Antietam, AP Hill did not arrive until mid-afternoon, but in the game, he is there from the beginning. I think it would be good to have some kind of ""delay"" of (in this case) 10 turns or so, to give account for Hill's late - and vital for the final outcome - appearance. Likewise at Prarie Grove, Union General Blunt arrived after the battle began, but in the game he is present from the start. A ""delay"" of 6-8 turns would help to make the game more ""realistic"".5) The game does not allow for divisions that were present, but not used. At Antietam, McClellan kept much of his cavalry in reserve, and, as such, they were not a major factor in the battle. They are not represented in the game. A good ""what if"" would be to have the cavalry become ""available"" after a few turns and see what difference they would have made at the ""Burnside Bridge"".These are personal ""quibbles"" and the rules are good as they are. If you want to introduce more ""realistic"" aspects, then modify the rules to suit yourself.As I said, I have enjoyed the game, and highly recommend it to you. Of course, having played the battle - or even before playing the battle, reading up on it to find out who, what, when - will make the game even more enjoyable.p.s. I ended up winning (for the South) the battle of Prairie Grove - but in the process I think that I killed my g-g-grandfather.",5.0,"Great game for re-enactment and ""what if""",1366848000,"04 25, 2013",Toys_and_Games,1.0

I feel like it is somewhat of a cross between Risk and Settlers of Catan. The board is flat, and you place hex pieces to map out the battlefield with the appropriate terrain. Then, you place your pieces down. The rule book has a vast variety of different battles to choose from, and it maps out each one, telling you where to place terrain and troops. It also lets you know of any special rules for that scenario, how many cards you get, and who goes first. Setup time can be long, but oh, is it worth it.Like I said, it is sort of like a cross between Settlers and Risk. It is like Settlers because of the hex-pieces determining terrain. It is like Risk in that you have your troops move around dice to determine if you roll a hit or not. You are given a set number of cards at the beginning of the game, and those contain the command orders you may play. You draw a new card at the end of every turn. When you play a card, you give orders to the appropriate ""units"" and that activates them to move and battle. Once battle is over and you've drawn your card, it is the other person's turn.The goal of the game is to collect ""flags"" which are connected to units. As you kill off units, you get the last man standing who is holding a flag and that counts for one victory point. Each scenario has its own rules for how many flags it takes to win, but the typical number is six.Each game takes around an hour to play after setup is done, and I have played around three games now. I have lost two out of three...but I don't really care because of how much fun I was having.

Since I am more of a traditional wargamer with the map and tiny unit counters a game like this strikes me as more of a toy.  Still, its a great little system for the novice, and even for the grognard wargamer like myself.Many people who might otherwise not get into strategy gaming because they are put off by the perceived complexity of wargames might get inspired to play this.  The cute blue and grey toy soldiers with flags are visually appealing.  The moveable terrain pieces makes for attractive, simple maps.Those who want a more detailed simulation with historical Brigades and Regiments won't find that here.  Units are generic according to type and can be any size depending on the action fought.  This gives the game a lot of flexibility, and allows for the players to design myriads of their own battles. But the historical detail is lacking a bit. Still, the 30 scenarios included in the game are more than enough to get your teeth into.  Many focus on lesser known actions of the Civil War which is always nice to see.A fun re-make for those who played the original long ago.  A much different game now.  A great idea for the novice gamer and for those who have only played regular board games before.  You can probably get your girl friend to play this one!

The pieces look great, the board is sweet, and the box has neat compartments to keep all your pieces organized. One of the best things about this board game compared to other strategy games is how quickly a round will play. One round should def not last more than an hour once you have figured out the rules. On that note, the rules are VERY easy to understand. The only complaint I have would be that the terrain pieces are pretty easy to slide out of place. But this is a very small concern. As long as you keep a steady hand when you're moving units to and from, its no big deal. I've though of solutions the manufacturer could have made to fix this problem but all of them would raise the price and ruin the aesthetics. ANYWAY, def worth every dollar. Tremendous replay value.I should include this to anyone buying this game. I had trouble with this because the definition of an order could have been better explained. I had to go online to figure out how attacking applies to an order. Me and my friend were making the mistake of attacking with every unit on the board capable of attacking during the attack phase which, frustratingly is what the rule book tells you to do. But what you're supposed to do is only attack with ORDERED units. So lets say you got a card which gives you three orders in the right flank. You can make three units move of course. But lets say you wanted one of those units to attack but not move. Well you need to specify which three units are being ordered from the start. So first specify the three units, move two, then attack with the one not moving during the attack phase (and attack with the other moved units if capable). It's very simple but I don't think the book explained it well enough.

In that regard, I was not disappointed.Battle Cry is what is commonly called a 'light wargame'.  The game comes with multiple scenarios, each one based off of historical battles from the Civil War.  Thanks to the different terrain tiles, each battle presents its own set of advantages, disadvantages and challenges for each side.  This means that the game has a fairly high replay value, which is good for something that costs nearly fifty dollars.  Another thing I like about the game is that a single battle is usually finished within an hour.  Although some people might find this a disadvantage, I've found that my shelf has far too many games that, while fun, are almost never used because finding an entire afternoon to devote to them is difficult.Of course, the game is not without its flaws.  The rules are fairly simple and easy to grasp, but this does reduce the amount of strategic options.  Furthermore, while the commands and colors system is usually excellent, it can at times be frustrating when the battle boils down to who had the right cards at the right time.

Its asymetrical map, radically different factions and over-price and under-priced units look like a child's version of a game that they made so that they can win.

The biggest bad guys go first and completely decimate the map in one round. They start with more property, earn more initial income and have more and stronger starting armies. But they have less starting gold (by one or two or three gold pieces) and have weaker event cards. The rag-tag left overs will find themselves struggling for a foothold for the next round or two. But as the dust settles and with some keen strategic maneuvers, it's anyone's game.Each faction has its own flavor. The Iron Circle will draw cards that might indicate that they enforce compulsoray military service, so you get bonus hobgoblin soldiers. The elves may draw an event card that enables their elven archers to move double the speed with their quick elven legs. The super-evil black-death faction may draw a spell that makes their black dragon have extra acidic breath. And so forth. The cards are quite varied as they alter and flavor the game with each passing round.Fighters and wizards will go off on quests to defeat ogres, dragons and basilisks and the like to earn powerful treasures that will make your entire nation stronger -- or just your heroes. These treasures will open up new strategic avenues for your nation.Or your fighters and wizard can join the armies.Meanwhile, your armies will defend and expand your borders, sail the seas to gain an island property, and establish castles from which they can build more armies on the front lines.Each unit of your army has a certain percent chance to damage another unit. And most of them have other special abilities (for instance, the dragon can ignore some damage and fly, the storm elemental doubles in strength over water and the wizard can kill others before the first shot is even fired). You will be constantly organizing your army to make it the most efficient.The entire game is made up of high quality materials. The figures are all strong and simply don't break under normal use. The box's art and appearance is top-notch and durable. But the part I like most is the interior. The box has everything laid out beautifully. It has a spot for all of your tokens, cards and units. There's no need to get zip-lock bags to organize everything yourself (although, I did use zip-lock bags in order to separate out the types of units for quick set-up).After playing a few games, I can set-up the game in 20 minutes by myself. I can break it down in 15 minutes on my own. Each full round (each player gets to go once) takes about 30-45 minutes. A short game can be completely in 3 full rounds, which takes about 2 hours for me.The rules aren't too thick. There's quite a few exceptions to remember, but it all makes logical sense. I had the rules down pat and memorized after just a few rounds of play.If anything was lacking, I'd buy a booster back with more treasure variation, more event variation and more dungeon variation if such a booster pack was available. I was also hoping for more dungeoneering mechanics and hero leveling. As it is, each dungeon just has 1 level with 1 or 2 monsters in it and the heroes don't level. I might just write my own rules to flavor the game for that.If you like strategy games and fantasy and you've got a group of friends to play with, this one is an awesome buy.",5.0,Unique and exciting board game experience,1313971200,"08 22, 2011",Toys_and_Games,1.0

The new Dungeons & Dragons board game ""Conquest of Nerath"" is a delight for gamers everywhere.  It plays like an interesting variation of Risk with a D&D; twist; while world domination isn't the only way to win the game, building armies and defeating opponents is the core of game play.  Two to four people can play, but due to the way the game is set up, having four players is definitely ideal; all four armies must be in play, so a two-person game requires each player to play two armies at once.  The quality of the game pieces is impressive, from the sturdy Event and Treasure cards to the glossy playing board to the relatively detailed individual army pieces, and experienced gamers will appreciate not having to separate those pieces from their original sprues.  The overall design and layout is reminiscent of  Fourth Edition D&D; player handbooks.  With its extensive rule book, ""Conquest of Nerath"" may seem daunting at first, but once players get the hang of game play, it is easy to get lost in this strategic board game.Originally published for San Francisco/Sacramento Book Reviews.",5.0,"Explore dungeons, defeat your opponents, and conquer the world!",1328054400,"02 1, 2012",Toys_and_Games,1.0

I'm a board and card game aficionado, and love rich mechanics that aren't too convoluted. Nerath strikes an even balance between being complicated, straightforward, and interesting. There is no clear dominant strategy; the event cards will mix up the game every time. I've played eight games so far, and not a single game has looked remotely similar. The victory point method of determining the winner is good, but so far I've favored the longer games, where the goal is to take both enemy capitals; some weird tactics come into play with victory point games, which is just fine, but something about marching across the landscape with vast armies appeals to me. There are a lot of ways to play the game, though, and the four nations are very asymmetrical, which makes for an interesting play experience. You'll probably develop favorites; I'm partial to the under-dog starting positions, so I tend toward the Iron Circle and League of Nerath, but I've really enjoyed games as all four sides. The default Alliance mode of play is interesting, and sets up conflict right away. Conflict in the game starts up immediately, and it never really lets up.My complaints with the game are minor. I have seen a tendency for one nation to get ganged up on, which is not necessarily a bad thing as long as the freed up nation either comes to the defense of their beleaguered ally or takes advantage of their deficient attentions. Luckily, playing toward a strong comeback is very possible, and one of the more exciting positions to be in.I really adore this game, and have introduced it to a great many of my friends.

This game markets itself for 2-4 players, but anything less than four players will force you to use rules that tried to find a way to make it work. Two players and four players are the real options, 3 players won't work so well as the rules for doing so can be a strain.Pros:1. This game incorporates the use of points so that the game doesn't drag out like risk can.2. This game has different units that move differently and have different rules to how they work.3. Dungeons offer the feel like you're fighting for treasure, even though the actual dungeon system is lame.4. Event cards offer flavor to the factions on the map.5. Tactics have a strong role in this board game.Cons:1. Different units move at different speeds and you can lose track of how much they can move, in addition to costing differently so you always need the reference sheet on hand in addition to different attack dice for different unit types. Movement also has additional rules attached, that while they feel realistic (dragons can fly over enemy territory without engaging but must land on friendly soil), can be a pain to remember (for instance, landing on enemy land that has no units AFTER a combat round is impossible as it would start combat and you can't do that once combat is over hence even though the land is empty, you can't land there).2. The dungeon system is REALLY lame, you pull at random a 'creature', which has very little development to it that you can actually simplify a description of said creature as 'strong/weak' and that's it. No real flavor to the point that it feels like the whole dungeon system was unnecessary.3. Only two hero units (hero units are the only ones able to fight in dungeons), with wizard easily outclassing the fighter because of the overpowered system of 'first strike', meaning before you check to see if the enemy has harmed/killed your troops, you check to see if you had enough successes with first strike to have gone ahead and won the battle. The fighter's SLIGHTLY cheaper cost does not offset this advantage.4. Overly complicated battle rules, especially for naval battles. First, only hero units can attack at sea while on a boat, second, elemental units do two times the damage at sea, third, sticking units on a boat spends one movement point for a boat, four, both armies roll attack at the same time and damage occurs at the same time meaning both can wipe each other out (never encountered this concept before, and remembering it amidst the many other rules is a pain), five, siege engines that are ATTACKING do more damage than siege engines that are defending (no wait, I meant POTENTIALLY, they roll two attacks and even though logic dictates that either both hit or both fail, it's somehow possible to miss on one, it's one of those rules that are more for mechanics than to actually make sense), six, building a castle confers no benefits to units, only to act as a point to drop off reinforcements, seven, some units can move again after a battle. There are other complicated battle rules but I'll stop here.5. Event cards offer the ONLY flavor to the factions on the map. The different factions have no real defining trait except for event cards, and most event cards are extremely similar. Would have been better to either work harder on defining the different factions or simply make them all the same.Truth be told? For what it achieves, I'd rather get risk. I don't know how I sound saying that, but just try to understand when I say 'for what it achieves'. If this game could feel more unique to its take on war games, then I'd prefer it to risk.

Tresca ""Talien""","[39, 40]","I didn't really want to review Conquest of Nerath.It's not that I don't like board games, but that I just don't have as much time to play them - my Xbox 360, Playstation 3, Tivo, and D20 Modern tabletop role-playing games all compete for time on my calendar. But then Wizards of the Coast offered me a chance to playtest Conquest of Nerath and I just couldn't say no.Conquest of Nerath is a Risk-like tabletop strategy game that involves moving armies across territories.  Reminiscent of the Might & Magic games, Conquest of Nerath has two scales: army and hero scale.  Armies, which range from creatures to castles, soldiers to ships, can only play across the terrain. Heroes, which include fighters and wizards, are an asset to an army and can also go dungeon crawling - which, let's face it, is the whole point of playing a D&D-themed; version of Risk.I've been railing against the decoupling of Dungeons & Dragons from toy stores for over a decade now, and it's refreshing to see Wizards of the Coast finally get it. Conquest of Nerath is not just D&D; in name alone.  It has a format and layout similar to 4thEdition Dungeons & Dragons, the terrain pieces are littered with familiar places like the Temple of Elemental Evil and the Tomb of Horrors, and the four different dragons actually look like their tabletop role-playing game counterparts.  Conquest of Nerath is proud of its roots and it harkens back to the original Dungeons & Dragons set in utilizing heroes on the battlefield.There are also several stylistic flourishes that appeals to veteran role-players.  Gaming grognards will recognize the aforementioned staples of dungeon crawling but also have a weakness for dice (guilty!). The number of dice determines a monster's hits, and you inflict one hit by rolling above a 6 on various dice.  Dragons, in case you're wondering, roll a d20. Conquest of Nerath comes with a lot of dice, but be warned - you will not have enough.  But then again, if you're anything like me, you have plenty of dice within each reach, if not stuck in your couch somewhere. If you like dice, you're going to love Conquest of Nerath.As a matter of necessity, the four armies of plastic pieces that come with the set are not 25mm scale.  They're probably more appropriate to a 15mm scale, although some are not necessarily scale-specific.  Ogres could easily pass as goblins, treants could easily pass as...smaller treants.  For those looking for repaints, this set won't provide much fodder unless you plan to use the smaller scale, in which case $80 buys you four armies.There are also event cards that mix up the game as well as treasure cards earned from dungeon crawling. If the game's gorgeous design falls somewhat flat, it's on the cards, which lack pictures.  If I win a vorpal sword after battling a medusa, I want to see it!Speaking of medusa, wizards and certain monsters have a first strike ability.  Normally all damage is inflicted simultaneously, which ensures mutual destruction.  But wizards have the ability to attack first before the opponent inflicts damage.  They also can dungeon crawl.  Although the damage they inflict is smaller, first strike is a very powerful ability and I ended up hording wizards as quickly as I could.If Conquest of Nerath has a flaw it's the fiddly bits: pieces for the dungeons, which could just as easily have been cards; treasury tokens that could easily be handled by counters; and victory points that could also have been handled by counters.  I prefer less pieces, but then again I may be biased by my mobile one-year-old's propensity to eat anything she can catch.Conquest of Nerath is a long overdue game that bridges the gap between tabletop dungeon crawls and board games. It's about time D&D; got a decent shot at the mainstream game audience.  Now all we need are conversion rules to integrate the Conquest of Nerath into mass combat rules for tabletop play!You can learn more about Conquest of Nerath at Wizard of the Coast's web site.",4.0,Risk for Role-Players,1308960000,"06 25, 2011",Toys_and_Games,1.0

I have been looking intently toward getting involved into WWII air warfare. I already have the Wings of War game, including sets of those miniatures.As a comparison:Pros:- Angels 20 miniatures are 1/100 scale, and much larger than WoW. They are easier to handle, and more durable.- The Angels 20 system is a better value, for the starter and the boosters.- The system allows for many types of planes, with more variability and special abilities. The starter includes cards for all 31 planes of the initial set.- The use of hexes removes the need for movement aids. In WoW, you need a special card deck for each aircraft, which is interesting, but is sometimes a pain to use.- Angels 20 includes advantages for pilot quality.- Angels 20 provides much more flexibility to perform maneuvers, and operations at different speeds.Cons:- Angels 20 miniatures are not painted as well as the WoW miniatures. Although smaller, the WoW miniatures have high detail and quality.- The damage system of Angels 20 is comparable to other A&A; miniatures games, and is thus quite simplistic. The damage and outcomes are portrayed more realistically in WoW. Pilots can be injured, you may have fire, smoke, rudder damage, etc.- Angels 20 requires a large hex map, included in the starter. WoW does not need a map.- Just like other Axis and Allies games, you need lots of dice, and there many dice modifiers and special abilities to count and add up. WoW is diceless, using simultaneous movement and firing, and damage chits drawn in the blind. Angels 20 uses sequential movement and firing.

There's still a lot of table talk, teamwork, and player interaction. And for those who are good at role playing, there's still room for it.So far I like the character selection, but if you really want a mage/wizard character, you wont find one in this game.

The other two are here:Dungeons and Dragons: Castle Ravenloft Board GameWrath of Ashardalon: A D&D; BoardgameIf you've played any of those games, skip past this part and go right to THE GOOD.It plays the same and the parts are all interchangeable.The basic game is played similar to Dungeons and Dragons 4th edition. You move a character, you attack baddies using class-specific skills and you finish a map by getting a unique item or killing a certain creature.The rules make for a fun, quick game. After just two or three hours, you'll have finished a dungeon. This is awesome for players who don't have the time to invest into full-on roleplaying.You can play this game by yourself or with up to 5 people. The more the merrier. You can play by yourself because the enemies all have their artificial intelligence listed on a card. For instance, you might get a card that says something like:If this creature is more than 2 tiles away, it moves 2 tiles closerIf this creature is 2 tiles away or less, it shoots with an Attack +5, 1 damageIf this creature is adjacent to a hero, it uses a dagger with an Attack +2, 1 damageAttacks are rolled with a 20-sided die (the only die needed for the game -- it is included). If the 20-sided-die roll + the Attack >= the hero's AC, then it's a hit. So you'd want to engage the creature adjacent to it so that it will have a low chance of hitting your character.If you kill a creature, you gain a treasure and experience. If you ever roll a 20, you can trade experience to level up your character (can only be done once). A leveled up character has better stats and can have more skills.Now onto the good parts and bad parts of this game:THE GOOD--------The figures are the best yet. You get a bunch of goblins and undead along with some awesome trolls, a dragon and a massiveBalor. They are not painted like the expensive miniatures, but you could paint them yourself if you wanted. They are very durable and extremely well-detailed.Also, the quests in this edition are better than the others. They feel more personal. You get to know the characters better (they are R.A. Salvatore's already well-establish characters (note:  I have not read his Drizzt stuff yet, so you still get to know the characters even if you haven't read his work)). The game feels more connected and less ""go here, kill this guy, move on.""THE LESS GOOD-------------The previous 2 games had more solid cards. They were indisputably clear. Not so in this edition.During the 2nd or 3rd quest, we ran into a boss character's AI that was not clear. It said something similar to:  ""If he is adjacent to only 1 hero, he attacks with a vampiric dagger. If he is more than 1 tile away, he approaches and attacks with a sword. If he is 2 tiles or more away, he moves 2 tiles closer.""What wasn't clear was what he would do if he was adjacent to more than 1 hero. He isn't more than 1 tile away, but he has more than 1 hero adjacent to him. Does he use the sword? Does he use the dagger? Is he scared and doesn't do anything? (that's what the goblin archers do -- it's not a ridiculous thought)The next quest we did, we had to kill a dragon. The dragon's AI did some weird things. You had to be on his tile to attack him. But there were areas where you could be adjacent to the dragon, the dragon couldn't go by you and you couldn't attack the dragon.As far as we could tell, the card didn't list if the dragon could fly over characters (we assumed it could). It didn't list what the dragon would do if there was no place for it to land (would it toss the characters aside so that it had room? -- we assumed it would).It's not a major problem because everyong playing the game can just decide how to fill in the gaps. But it was somewhat annoying considering how perfect the AI was in the previous two games.OVERALL-------If you like dungeon hack-n-slash style of board games but don't want to invest the time that mammoth games likeDescent Journeys in the Darkrequire, then this is where you need to go.These are my favorite hack-n-slash board games I've ever played.",5.0,Better and worse than previous like games,1323648000,"12 12, 2011",Toys_and_Games,1.0

It plays like 4th edition lite and most adventures can be played in under 2 hours once you get the hang of the rules and setup. I also have the Castle Ravenloft game set which is a good purchase as well and Wrath of Ashardalon is currently in transit to me. Just keep in mind this is mostly a combat and trap oriented game. There is little to no role playing involved. Most Dungeons and Dragons style board games are similar in this respect.Newcomers to Dungeons and Dragons may be a little confused by the rules at first, but they are not so numerous as to be impossible to figure out. Setup for people not used to table top gaming or more involved board games may be a little intimidating, but if you are patient then you will get the hang of it.As someone who also plays table top Dungeons and Dragons, the value in the miniatures from this box set alone is worth the price (It comes with 42 minis including 4 large and one huge). If you have ever tried purchasing minis you know that they cost way more than $1 apiece unless you find deals on ebay or craigslist that don't require high shipping prices.  The minis are unpainted true, but they are durable and can easily be painted if you desire. The minis of all of these games provide a decent mix of bad guys and heroes for regular Dungeons and Dragons as well as the game.I especially like this game more than Castle Ravenloft because you get to play Drizzt and friends. Its compatibility with the other box sets also means you can take Drizzt, Wulfgar, Bruenor and the others through adventures outside of the Underdark.I highly recommend this game to DnD fans and Drizzt fans as well as people who want to start playing Dungeons and Dragons type games.",5.0,Love this one!,1362009600,"02 28, 2013",Toys_and_Games,1.0

Salvatore was releasing the first Drizzt books at around the same time, so I picked the series up and have read every one of the novels.  For the most part they're great and I would highly recommend them.  This game has a lot of recognizable names, which is nice for everyone like myself who has read the books.  However, I did not find the game to be much fun at all.  Here's why:1) There is no role-playing.  The game is purely hack-and-slash, which is not what I look for in D&D.;  It could have been ok, however...2) The rules are over-restrictive (and simplified from full-on D&D;) and get in the way of enjoyment.  This game still has tons of rules, but they're taking components of D&D; (which is far more complex) and smashing them into a single-purpose board game.  This means that you still have to spend a lot of time learning fairly inconsequential rules that are essential to the functioning of the game.3) There is only a single, workable strategy if you want to win: run...fast.  Because of the way the game is designed, your characters are punished for not moving at an extremely rapid pace toward the objective.  It makes the game difficult to enjoy because I spend all my time strategizing how to avoid drawing Encounter cards (which you'll become familiar with if you play the game).  The rest of the decisions you need to make in the game are extremely straightforward and simple.  Some characters only have one reusable attack option.Some of my friends who had never played a real RPG before had a good time with this game.  We later played a real D&D; session, which they liked more.  In my opinion, this is a 2.5 star game (I bumped it to 3 because I'm a Drizzt fan and less RPG-experienced people liked it more).  I don't care to play it again, but that's because I know there's much better stuff out there.  The game appealed more to people used to playing board games rather than RPGs.

This is D&D; with rubber pants, I ain't gonna lie. But that doesn't mean it's not a ton of fun. See, haters gonna hate, but this game is not for them. This game is for me and others like me.See, I really want to like D&D.; I wish I did, because I love the concept. But in my experience (which, I'll grant you, is limited to creating a character and doing a one-player campaign), it felt too much like trying to do my taxes and read The Lord of the Rings at the same time. I just couldn't get into it and I found that really disappointing.Then I found out about these Dungeons & Dragons board game thingies. I looked into them and was delighted to find that it seemed much more up my alley. In the spirit of never knowing until you try, I bought the Legend of Drizzt (pronounced ""Drist"" by the way, thank you Google) on the basis that he's the only D&D; character I'm at all familiar with.And man, I'm glad I did. It says something that I've so far only played the first campaign out of the included adventure book and I enjoyed it enough to play it again.So, let's talk content: This is one heavy box.-Instruction Book: A little thin, so learning can be a challenge; there isn't enough information there to address every possible eventuality. You're gonna be invoking House Rules on a few occasions.-Adventure Book: Something like a dozen campaigns, with enough variation to keep it fresh and interesting. There are two single-player adventures, several co-ops and some ""vs. mode"" stuff.-Tokens: Thirteen sheets of heavy-stock cardboard popouts. That's enough to make certain other board games blush (Arkham Horror, you sexy beast, I'm looking in your direction). I highly recommend a good supply of Ziplock sandwich baggies. Still, I much prefer a token system to endless scribbling, erasing and scribbling again on a character sheet.-Miniatures: there are quite a lot of these as well. They are used to represent the various heroes and beasties, and are moved around the build-as-you go, tile-based board throughout the game. They all look great, but there's just one problem: they're not guaranteed to all come out of the box in perfect condition. They're not likely to be broken, but perhaps awkwardly bent--one of my Drow soldier dudes is extending a sword whose blade curves sharply to the left. Likewise, the big mean angry dragon looks kinda silly with one wing sticking straight up in the air. There's probably a way to fix these that I don't know about.-Cards: There are 200 in total, which may sound intimidating, but after they're all separated into their various categories (even if you combine the Beginner and Advanced decks like I did), it's really not that bad.Well, there you have it, my review of The Legend of Drizzt board game. I hope you found it as informative and helpful as I tried to make it. I highly recommend this game if you're the right kind of person for it and if you don't expect what it isn't going to deliver.

I am, however, very familiar with D&D; and Drizzt.  I've played most of the D&D; video games, my favorites being:  The Temple of Elemental Evil, and the Baldur's Gate Series.  I've also read most of the Drizzt books.This game is fantastic in that it perfectly catches Drizzt's adventures from the book and feels very much like a turn based dungeon crawling video game.  I'm very familiar with the D&D; rules, even without playing true D&D.;  While this game is watered down to the extreme, there is still enough of the essence of the rules for you to know that it is Dungeons and Dragons.On to how fun it is, and BOY IS IT FUN!  There is one single player adventure, and some of the other adventures are easily adapted into single player use.  Single player is not boring, but doesn't give you a grasp of how great this product is.  Multiplayer is where it shines.  There are 40 or so durable miniatures, including a few really big ones, and durable puzzle pieces that build your dungeon, or cavern in this game.  It feels like you are building a puzzle and playing with a big box of toys all at the same time.Jokes come fast and plenty while playing with friends.  This game proves to be just as enjoyable making fun of, as it is playing it.  Encourage your friends to get in character too, which makes the whole thing sillier and even more fun.There are 13 adventures that come with the game.  The adventures last from an hour, to an hour and a half.  Each dungeon is randomly generated because you shuffle items like the dungeon tiles and monster cards everytime you play.  If you go back and use different heroes as well, and there a lot to choose from, this game has considerable replay value.This game really does feel like playing a CRPG.  It proves to be more fun though.  With the interaction of friends, choosing random scenarios, and characters to play through this game proves to be simply PHENOMENAL!I didn't realize that board games could be this fun.

My boyfriend and I frequently play board games together, and oftentimes we meet with another couple for dinner and game night.

There are some rare instances where the rulebook isn't clear, so sometimes you will have to decide for yourself how to respond in those situations. The game play is fluid, and there are multiple ways that you can play the game, which means that the fun is always a bit different.There are TONS of pieces, so it helps to find a good system for organizing them all. The game is relatively quick too! Most games last between 30 and 45 minutes, BUT the setup takes about 10 to 15 minutes. It's almost not worth it to dig out all the pieces if you're only going to play one game, simply because it takes a minute to get everything situated. Typically we play 2 or 3 games back to back while we have everything laid out.You do need ALOT of space to play as well. Usually we just play in the floor, that way we can build the dungeon without fear of running out of room.Overall, it's a great game.

The abilities are more fun, the playable heroes finally branch out somewhat from the tired old standard classes, there are eight playable heroes instead of five, and the new team challenge adventures and betrayal adventures are great additions to the rules. I also like that the rock walls look jagged and organic: the straight-line sameness of the dungeons in the previous two games made the environments dreary and boring.My only complaint is that there are too few challenging monsters: these heroes and items are a lot more powerful - frequently granting the ability to reliably deal 2 damage per turn - and the 1-hp goblin monsters never stay on the board longer than 1 turn. Owners of Castle Ravenloft and Wrath of Ashardalon can remedy this by adding more challenging monster cards and figurines from those games - the Cave Bear and the Gargoyle come to mind.I do think that ""Legend of Drizzt"" is an inappropriate name. Having played a half-dozen adventures in this game I can confidently say that Bruenor Battlehammer is the star of this show, and that nothing, nothing at all in any of the D&D; Adventure System board games, can compare to the moment when he deals the killing blow to a dragon or a balor with his ""headbutt"" ability.

I have been playing Dungeons and Dragons for about 25 years now and when I saw the board games come out I was a bit skeptical. Recent iterations of the RPG have watered down the mechanics and left a lot gamers frustrated by the lack of depth and complexity. I expected the same thing would have happened here (and it did out of necessity) AND, worst, that doing so was going to create a droll and boring boardgame (it did not).Pros:-quick to learn and get involved with. Even non D&D; players can enjoy a dungeon adventure quickly while getting into some, but not all, of the mechanics underlying the D20 system.-adaptive boardsetup makes it so that you can play the same adventure (or a very similar one by modifying the end villian) a near endless number of times because the dungeon will change-The figure quality and materials of this game are a great quality. The miniatures look amazing. Take a moment to google &#34;Legend of Drizzt painted miniatures&#34; to see what some paint can do to them. Amazing-I was laughing, cursing, and having a great time every single second of the game (even the frustratingly dangerous encounter seconds...albeit that was more cursing)-The ability to blend it (tiles/monsters/equip/etc) with the other board games makes it even more adaptable.-The cooperative nature of the gameplay makes it feel like an old school dungeon hack RPG. It's fun to talk strategy and plan the plight of your adventurers.Con:-Leveling up is difficult and you may play 4 games and only level a character once. It has a way to promote them in game by either a natural 20 or a battlefield promotion card from the equipment deck. There is only one battlefield promotion card and rolling a 20 may or may not be the luck of your entire game. I am four games in and have only leveled once.-Each of the equipment cards includes a price in gold, but there is no mention of gold and money in any of the rules. It creates an opportunity to 'add-in' your own homebrew rules, but as it is- it is an extra feature that means little to nothing. One example of a homebrew rule we are exploring is that if you discard X price in gold (10,000 is our current test) and you can level a character.This also helps with the first criticism.-YOU MADE A D&D; GAME AND DIDN'T INCLUDE A CLERIC OR A MAGE. Seriously wizards? Sure, you can find a wand of magic missle or a wand of lightning bolt, but you dont have a player character who is able to cast spells as a default. You can't be a healer. I enjoy the fighters, but it's a pity that you dont get to get into the mysticism that is D&D.; Maybe they are in other versions of the board game, but it seems foolish (and unfortunate) not to include. A lack of a cleric also makes it that much harder to make it through the game (old school RPG wisdom is you always need a cleric).",5.0,Great Game,1388448000,"12 31, 2013",Toys_and_Games,1.0

I wanted to review it, however, as an experience for playing with young children.Summary - 5/5I have 2 kids, one 4 one 6.5. This game is excellent for introducing children 6+ to gaming concepts, and enjoying some quality time together. I would not recommend it as a first game, but once your kids have some basic ideas of gameplay, its cooperative nature offers a perfect blend of progressively independent action and bonding.Theme and appeal - 5/5The theme and appeal of the game is obvious. By the age of 3 or 4 most children will have been bombarded with a variety of fantasy narratives, and enjoy them. Spooky dungeons. Scary dragons. Heroic knights. While some parents may be concerned at the idea of crawling through caves and killing monsters, my personal view is that this comes very naturally to kids these days, and is in fact quite empowering - see a monster, whammo! blast it with a magic wand.This game creates a very tactile upfront experience of the things they have seen on TV or in story books. The little miniatures are very appealing, both to my 3 (almost 4) year old girl, and to my 6.5 year old son.Is it kid proof - 3/5This game is sturdy and durable. You will, however, need to keep a close eye on all the bits, which can be easily lost if not kept in themed baggies, and without very clear 'putting away when used' rules.The miniatures can probably take some abuse, but also need some care as there are bits that could be snapped off. You will also need to be disciplined with the cards. When my son gets excited, he waves his arms and is sometimes tempted to squish them inside his hands.Assuming you play on the floor (which I do) you may also need to make clear no walking or rolling over the board rules...Can a 6/7 year old contribute meaningfully, and feel fulfilled? - 4/5Most certainly, but with guidance. Even a three year old can choose which corner of a new tile to explore, and count out spaces (although it helps if they have learned space counting in other games first). A 6/7 year old can choose which powers they want to use, although may need some tactical/strategic guidance.I found the game offered plenty to make my son feel very fulfilled playing the game. We died in our first adventure, but despite this setback he was delighted to recall some of his more heroic moments, and how if we had only done this or that we might just have made it.Can Dad enjoy it while playing with the kids? - 5/5Certainly he can. One way to view it is as solo plus, in which you still may have to make a majority of the strategic decisions - which (despite some complaints about the game being too easy) are not always simple - but you also get the pleasure in sharing the experience with others.You can also use the game to practice your story telling skills to a sometimes quite demanding audience!Is it educational? - 5/5OK, let's be clear up front that this is not going to enhance your child's understanding of world geography, or the way plants grow. It is fantasy.But first up, I consider fantasy to be an important part of human culture, and one of the shared experiences that bind society together.Beyond that, the game teaches social play. Teamwork. Tactical and strategic decision making. Logic. (If-then, if not-then something else). Basic AI. Planning. It encourages reading, and thinking about maths and probability. It teaches rule systems, and how to best use them to your advantage. What's not to love about this, especially in an era of electronic solitude?Is it easy to learn/teach? - 4/5Again, this puts a certain amount of onus on the parent. I highly doubt your 6.5 year old will be able to read and understand the rules without guidance.I made the mistake of trying a first game without understanding everything myself, and my poor son was stuck watching me sweat my way through the rules (as can be seen from another posting I made). It might be a good idea to do a solo run first.But once you get the basic concepts (how monsters move!), it comes quite easily. Yes, you do need to explain how the powers work. How the exploration works. How the monsters work. It is a lot to absorb at first.But if your kid is interested, they will pay attention, and it can be revealed progressively through gameplay.I am also amazed how much space a 6/7 year old has in his/her brain to absorb new rules... more than once I've opened an old card game and asked - hmm, how many do we deal to start? - only to have my son answer for me...Does it play out reasonably quickly? - 4/5I am assuming, with this score, that you know that you are in for a substantial game. i.e. This is not a ten minute frisson. The question is whether it can keep a kid's attention or not.In my first game, I found myself wishing it would take a little less time. Not a lot less, but right at the end - when it went past bedtime, and was starting to drag a little.That said, the denouement came roughly about the time I expected, and my son's attention was pretty gripped (allowing for a couple of short breaks). And there would be no harm in tweaking the game a bit... one or two fewer tiles, perhaps, before the final boss, could be one approach.Is it fun? - 5/5Yes! Its theme, fairly simple gameplay, and balance of achievement and challenge works well for kids. Everyone loves receiving a treasure. Everyone hates getting a nasty encounter.Great game. And given it is a system more than a game, with a lot of variety, I hope to be playing this for quite some time.",5.0,Great for father-child bonding!,1337472000,"05 20, 2012",Toys_and_Games,1.0

Also, for advanced players, the stuff in the box is a great bargain versus buying separate maps and minis.Minuses:  The rules are far too simplified for experienced players, and the packaging really doesn't allow storing all the random bits and markers without getting them mixed up.I mainly purchased this set as an accessory to my regular gaming kit.  The little plastic minis are more fun than cardboard tokens anyday, and the heavy laminated cardboard map sections are wonderful for setting up a map ahead of time, or making one up as you go, depending on your gaming style.  There is also a wealth of little condition markers, which while inferior to chits like the ones made by GF9, are nonetheless useful, especially to the GM on a budget.If you choose to play it as advertised,the rules have been simplified to streamline play and keep up the pace of the game, which is a draw to new players, or those who fancy a quick game of solitaire, as it were.  Long time D&D; players will probably find those rules unsatisfying though.All in all, a good product, no matter which way you decide to use it.

If you are a fan of high fantasy in any format (literature, RPG's, films, computer games, etc.)you should find this game stimulating.The Highlights:*the game system is easy to learn and plays smoothly (for the most part...see ""Drawbacks"" later in the review)*the pieces are very well made, especially the miniatures*allows for creation of additional adventure scenarios*great variety of playing pieces*can be played in a short amount of time; 45 min.- 1 hourDrawbacks:*Rules: I'm not a fan of a monster automatically being placed on every tile; i.e., I like it to be a bit more random. This is more of a personal dislike of the game system. I've played traditional D&D; (RPG) for over 3 decades and like ""wandering monsters"" to be more random. I made some house rules with my own random encounter chart and monsters only appearing on a roll of a 1 or 6 on a d6. In my house rules, black triangles on the well-crafted cavern tiles call for a random roll as well as an automatic encounter card draw whereas white triangles only call for a random roll for a monster.Once I worked in this house rule, the game seemed much more enjoyable to me personally. Others may not find the automatic placement of a monster on every tile to be an issue.I also don't like the fact that your movement stops once you reach the edge of a tile. Thus, again, I interjected a house rule in which players may continue their movement onto a newly placed tile during their ""hero"" phase of a game. Basically, this somewhat combines the ""hero"" phase of a turn with the ""exploration"" phase in which new tiles are placed. Otherwise, if a hero stops at the edge of a tile, which calls for the placement of a new cavern tile, he/she will automatically be attacked by the monster that pops up on the new tile! Under the rules as they are written, the player essentially NEVER gets to attack first in combat when a new tile is placed. By allowing players to advance onto a newly placed tile the heroes can attack if they can reach the monster with whatever remains of their allotted movement.*Storage requires plastic baggies in order to keep the plethora of pieces separate (this is a minor complaint; don't let it keep you from purchasing the game....the variety of pieces is one of the true strengths of this product)Overall:The game is quite fun with or without modification. If, like me, you don't like some of the features of the rules such as a monster appearing automatically on every tile and monsters that attack first every time you place a new tile, then a few house rules will facilitate play.

If you're in search of more opinions, you should definitely check out the reviews for Castle Ravenloft and Wrath of Ashardalon, as the games are all very similar. I also own and enjoy Castle Ravenloft.They all use very loose adaptations of 4th Edition D&D; rules. This particular game is (obviously) based on R.A. Salvatore's books about dark elf orc-stabber extraordinaire, Drizzt Do'Urden. As such, all the adventures are based on Drizzt's literary exploits (all the way up to Gauntlgrim, I was surprised to see), and the choice of heroes includes the Companions of the Hall, and there are rules for playing as (as well as against) the notable trio of ne'er-do-wells Entreri, Jarlaxle, and Athrogate.Playing the Game----------------Each player chooses one of five pre-made heroes, and then chooses which of that hero's powers they'll use for the adventure (you take 4 or 5 out of around 10). Next, you follow the Adventure Book's rules to setting up whatever adventure you're playing (there are about 15 different adventures), and you make your way through the dungeon trying to complete the adventure's objective.The ""board"" is made up of jigsaw puzzle-style pieces which you shuffle before the adventure like cards. You start with one tile as the ""start tile"", and then each player has the chance to draw a tile on his or her turn and add it to the tiles already played, which I'll get into next. This is how the play area expands.Each player's turn follows the same order - move and/or attack with your hero, add a dungeon tile (unveiling a new monster), then activate the monsters you've unveiled. So, each player controls not only his hero, but the monsters he or she reveals. This is done by following the instructions on the monster's card, which tells you how the monster acts.When a player dies, he or she uses a Healing Surge, which acts like a ""continue"". If a player dies and there are no Healing Surges left (you start most adventures with 2), the players lose. So, it's a no-man-left-behind situation.You win, as I mentioned, by completing whatever objective the adventure sets out. Usually, this involves reaching a specific tile and killing whomever is hanging out there.Enjoying the Game-----------------At the end of the day, this is a very streamlined game. The heroes have no stats other than AC, HP, Speed, and Surge Value (the amount you heal when you use a surge). You don't equip your guy, you can't level up past Level 2 (which entails adding 2 HP, 1 AC, and a new daily power), and there is no continuity between missions.Strategically, the game is pretty simple. You don't have a whole mess of options, and sometimes it can be pretty obvious what the best move is, meaning the game can feel like it's playing itself sometimes. Honestly, when I first started playing these Adventure System games, I was disappointed. Being a ""gamer"", I'm no stranger to complex rule systems and this was just too simple for me.But then I added friends. And not just any friends; non-gamer friends. Non-gamer friends, and booze. And jokes. And silly descriptions, and trash-talking (despite the co-operative nature of the game), and bouts of not paying attention. Basically, everything that absolutely ruins a regular D&D; session.The simple nature means there's very little to keep track of (once everyone learns the flow of play), and you don't need to clear your entire calendar to schedule a session. I've had a blast every time since then, and the game has quite a following now among my gamer and non-gamer friends alike.If you go into it expecting it to be a very rich, very complex board game version of D&D;, you're not going to be happy.

Send the heroes on quests to earn points.  Players draw one of the eleven hidden character cards that will score them extra points at the end of the game for certain quests or buildings.

The game has 8 total turns with each player getting a number of distinct actions within each turn, which are tracked through ""agent"" tokens.  If you are playing a 2-player match, each player would start with 4 agent actions per turn, and if you have the maximum recommended 5 players, there would only be 2 agent actions per turn.  The 3-player version, players start with 3 agent actions.  Once the fifth turn is reached, all players are given an additional agent, making the later turns a little more important than earlier turns.  This is a nice way of having games with more players be a little less burdensome than it would be otherwise.  There are also two additional ""agents"" (with associated extra actions for the player that controls them) which can become available during later rounds.The basic concept of the game is that each of the players represents the ""sponsor"" for adventurers (wizards, thieves, fighters, clerics) in a D&D; world.  Scoring consists of ""victory points"", which may be earned in various ways, but are mostly earned by having sponsored adventurers complete ""quests"".  To complete a quest, each quest will have a specific number of each type of adventurer that need to be recruited, and perhaps gold to be supplied.  Once completed, quest rewards (adventurers, gold, and/or victory points) will be earned.  Players recruit the adventurers or earn the gold by having their agents visit various buildings within the city.  There are also ""intrigue"" cards which can be played against other players to interfere with their progress in getting quests completed.There are no dice rolled in this game, so it really is a ""resource"" game with shuffled cards providing the randomness to make the game different with each play.  Even though this is set in the Dungeons and Dragons universe, and having some experience with D&D; makes it easier to grasp some of the concepts, past experience playing D&D; is certainly not a requirement for enjoying this board game.  For me, given that I don't have as much free time as I used to when I was younger, it is nice to not have to take hours ""prepping characters"" before jumping into a fun game set in the D&D; universe.This game could certainly take a long period of time if everyone plays slowly and deliberately, but fast paced game play is very much a possibility, potentially allowing for multiple play-throughs on game night.  The rules seem simple enough that one play through will be more than enough for people to understand almost all of the nuances to the game without too much trouble.  So, while new players might be at a disadvantage in not knowing exactly what to do in the first turn or two, after a while keeping up with experienced players shouldn't be too much of a problem.Overall, this is a very well balanced board game, with plenty of player interaction, and only a marginal level of ""cut throat"" actions harming other players.  While there is some potential for a player in the lead running away with the game, but due to some interesting design elements (hidden ""victory points"" that are counted at the end of the game; ""manditory quests"" that can be forced on other players, the ability to see what resources other players need to gain victory points) that is less of a problem than I have seen in other board games.I would rate this as a ""moderately serious"" board game with a high degree of re-playability.  I don't think I would enjoy a 2-player session quite as much as a 3, 4 or 5-player session.",5.0,Excellent Board Game,1380067200,"09 25, 2013",Toys_and_Games,1.0

McCabe,"[0, 0]","Check out full review at geeksplayinggames.comThe rule book (downloadable pdf) is 24 pages long, although only eight are about rules and explaining the parts of the game. There are 12 pages of appendices that give details about each building, the agents and each of the Lords and it wraps up with a glossary and the storage diagram. The back cover is a summary of the rules and a turn sequence reference.The game is played in eight rounds, the player with the most victory points at the end of the eight rounds is the winner. Each round consists of a number of turns equal to the number of agents a player has. Once all agents have been assigned the round ends. Each turn has two steps 1) Assign an Agent and 2) Complete a Quest. If you have agents left when your turn starts you must assign an agent, otherwise you are skipped and the next player who still has agents plays their turn. Completing quests is optional, if you have the resources to complete a quest you may, but you are not required to.The Quests are the main source for gaining victory points. Quests are completed by collecting gold and recruiting adventurers, which are represented by small colored blocks of wood. Clerics are white, fighters are orange, rogues are black and wizards are purple. Each quest is of a type that relates to which resource is primarily required to complete it. Piety quests will require more clerics than the Skullduggery quests which will require more rogues. Likewise warfare quests will see more fighters than the arcana quests that call on the magic of wizards. Commerce quests rely on gold and, generally, fewer adventurers. Each player gets a Lord card randomly, and that card will tell you which quests (in most cases) you need to complete to gain victory point bonuses.Gold and adventurers are gathered by sending out your agents who go throughout the city to one of nine buildings. Most buildings will provide your agent with your needed resource, which then gets placed in your Tavern, which is located on the player mat. There are four buildings which are not primarily about gathering resources. One of the buildings that you can assign your agents is Builder's Hall, where you are able to purchase new buildings that will add to the possible locations to gather future resources, in addition to giving the owner a special bonus for controlling the new building. Another unique building allows you to take the first player marker, and an intrigue card.Intrigue cards are the main way you are able to interact with the other players. They come in three fashions; Attack, which usually has a positive benefit for you while negatively effecting your opponent's, Utility, which always benefits you and may benefit an opponent or two, and Mandatory quests, which are quests you give to your opponents that they are required to complete before completing any other quest. Intrigue cards can only be played by assigning an agent to Waterdeep Harbor. The harbor has three numbered spaces for the agents to be assigned, you then play an intrigue card. The round continues as normal, however before the next round begins, each agent in the harbor gets reassigned to another building in order of the numbered spaces. The last, non-resource-giving building is the inn. Here you get one of the four face-up quests that are on the board, as well as gold, an intrigue card or you reset the quests and take one of the new ones.Finally, victory points are tracked along the edge of the board with a small round wooden disc that is the same color as your agents. If any player pases the 100 space there is a 100 victory point token you get to signify that you are rounding the track a second time.The game is fairly simple to learn. There are only two things you can do on each turn, so getting that down is relatively simple. The complicated part of the game comes in trying to outmaneuver your opponents. The quests you choose, the buildings you buy, the intrigue cards you play, will all impact the number of victory points you get. Figuring out what you should do on each turn is the hard part.The number of players determines the number of agents each player gets. Two players start with four agents, three with three, four and five start with two. In a two player game you have more to do each turn because you have more agents. Each player is also more likely to earn more victory points overall than in a game with fewer players. But this is a strategy game and the more players you have, the more you are going to have to plan.I really like this game. I downloaded the rules and as I read them I could totally see where they were going with the theme of the game and was very anxious to get and play it. I think the theme is what really makes the game. At its core, this is a resource gathering game, and if you approach it simply as such you will, I believe, really enjoy it. But if you limit yourself to viewing it as only a resource gathering game you are going to miss out on the richness of the well thought out theme. This is, after all, a D&D; based game. Get into it, roleplay a little. Don't say ""I need two orange ones"" call them fighters. Read the flavor text on the quests, complete the quests with some flashy description of what your adventurers accomplished. Have some fun with it. Like I said, aside from the theme its a fun game, but the theme is what makes it a great game. Highly recommended, lots of fun, definitely worth getting.",5.0,A Great Worker Placement game,1364860800,"04 2, 2013",Toys_and_Games,1.0

Experienced gamers will likely also love it. It is so elegantly designed, so easy to teach and remember, yet difficult to master, that it is a classic of its kind, right up there with other great gateway games likeTicket To Ride,Guillotine, Stone Age, andDominion. The quality of the components is excellent with (mostly) nice art throughout. The board is easy to understand and only rarely runs out of room for new buildings (10 slots are provided, but there is room in the center of the board to fit a few more in). Sure, the D&D; theme feels slightly pasted on, but the mechanics are sound and it's a hell of a lot of fun, with excellent replay value.At the beginning of the game, each player gets dealt a secret Lord card, representing which of the secret lords of the city they are playing. Each lord prefers two different types of quests and gives a 4 point end-game victory point bonus for completing quests of those types (no two lords prefer both the same quests, though many overlap with one). There is one exception, a lord who gives no quest bonus, but instead a 6 point bonus for each building you control at the end. This lord is harder to win with in games with more than 2 players, but in my experience, can be almost impossible to beat it in a 2-player game. You also get dealt two random quest and intrigue cards, which I'll explain below. Intrigue cards are kept secret until played, but quest cards are public knowledge and kept face-up until completed.You get a number of meeples (""your lord's agents"") who are placed one at a time in turn order until everyone has assigned all theirs. On the 5th round, everyone gets a bonus meeple. Most places, only one person can get the space's offering that turn. Two of the spaces allow up to three meeples to be assigned (including multiple of the same player's meeples). These are for gaining new quests or playing intrigue cards. Intrigue cards let you get a bonus, or mess with another player, or give everyone a bonus (but the person who played the card gets the best). The Builder's Hall space lets you choose from three different buildings to buy. Buildings offer cubes or money or intrigue cards beyond and better than the spaces on the board. They cost 4-8 money each. When you buy one, it is instantly available for use by all players. Whoever assigns their meple to the building space gets its offerings, but the owner of the building gets a reward too, which is usually a lesser version of the building's offering, but some offer in-game victory points. So you want to buy buildings and hope other players use them. If you use your own building, you don't get the owner reward, just whatever anyone would get for using it. All the other spaces give money or one or two of a specific color cube (""adventurer for hire"").You usually score in-game victory points by completing quests, of which there are five types: Warfare, Piety, Skullduggery, Commerce, and Arcana. Each requires a variety of colored cubes and/or money to complete, and the type of quest determines the bulk of the cubes and/or money it requires. White cubes are clerics (Piety), Purple cubes are wizards (Arcana), black cubes are thieves (Skullduggery), and orange cubes are fighters (warfare). Commerce quests all require money to complete in addition to a mix of cubes. Some quests offer an ongoing bonus power but are worth less (these are called Plot Quests and clearly marked on the quest card). However, most just give you an immediate victory point bonus and/or some other cool thing, such as bonus cubes or money. One even gives you an extra, special colored meeple, but is worth no points and is a pain to complete. Get it early enough, and you can have a huge advantage. Get it or complete it late and not only will it not be of much help, but will likely cost you the game if you waste resources on it that could be better spent collecting other quests that hand out victory points.The game lasts eight rounds. Each round, all the spaces you can place your meeples on refresh with whatever goods they are offering (money, buildings, intrigue cards, etc.). There is also a space for getting the first player token. There are always four face-up quests available, but if you don't want any of those, you can choose to discard them all in favor of four new ones, but then you're stuck with keeping one of whatever new ones come out. There is no penalty for uncompleted quests at the end of the game.My only real complaint is with the box itself. The way it is designed is arty-farty with a dumb extra ""fake"" bottom that can't be removed and exists just to look cool, so don't put any weight on it, as that bends/crushes the box easily, which is not acceptable, especially for a game that costs this much. And, due to the stupid design of the bottom, you can't put the top lid over it. It won't fit. The plastic insert tray holds everything separate and mostly snug (but way too snug in the case of the money and jewel tokens which are an absolute nightmare to put back in). As seemingly snug as things may appear, however, I wouldn't go turning the box upside-down if I were you. Also, after owning the game for a month, the inside bottom part of the box is split on two corners! Do you know how many game boxes have done that to me? Zero, at least in the time frame I'm talking about here. Normally, it takes years, possibly decades, for a box to fall apart, but not this one. In my opinion, this is the worst-designed game box in board game history, and the plastic insert tray is no prize, either. All the other components (cubes, cards, meeples, etc.) are solid and durable, however.The newLords of Waterdeep Expansion: Scoundrels of Skullport (D&D; Boxed Game)is due out August 20, 2013, and the rules are available to preview now as a free PDF on the Wizards of the Coast site. This double expansion contains two new add-on maps (one for the evil underground town of Skullport, one for the infamous dungeon of Undermountain). There are a ton of new buildings, new quests, new intrigue cards, six new Lords (including the beholder crime lord, Xanathar), a new resource called Corruption (and an associated Corruption Track board), as well as optional rules, important rules clarifications and errata for the base game, and a set of gray meeples to add a sixth player. It also includes an extra meeple in each of the original player colors for longer games, which are mandatory when adding a sixth player and optional otherwise. So a two-player game would have you begin with five meeples, then add a sixth one on round five. This expansion--the first of what will hopefully be many--adds a ton of replayability and new ways to strategize and win. After reading the rules, it looks like a must-own.Note that a guy in Canada is selling custom, laser-cut, painted ""DnDeeples"" (search for them using that term). For hardcore lovers of Lords, these can replace the cubes with meeple-looking clerics holding maces, dual-dagger wielding thieves, wizards with staff and pointy hat, and viking helmeted fighters with a sword!

Everything from the pieces, to the art, to the plastic tray insert is fantastic. I can't stress this enough. Even the manual is excellent as it includes appendices for all of the buildings, lord cards, and etc while also including a picture of how the pieces fit into the game's plastic insert. I'd give a thumbs up to this game just for this particular aspect alone.This game is fairly simple to learn and play. The most complex part, at least in my opinion, was getting used to all of the options you may have at any one time. There are many buildings that do various things...it's often that you may need to pause to figure out how you want to go about getting the resources you need while preventing your opponent from getting the resources they may need. Sure, you could assign an agent to your opponent's shop to get that fighter and wizard you need...but as a reward for you shopping there, your opponent may get the fighter they need to complete a quest.I really like the addition of the lord cards as they allow players to specialize in certain areas. For example, my son had the lord card that provided him with a bonus for every building he built by game's end. I, of course, didn't know that, though I noticed him purchasing buildings like mad throughout the game. I chalked it up to him just liking the feeling of owning a building...I won't make that mistake again. I was winning, but he pulled ahead and won by a hair because of all the bonus points he accumulated at the end of the game.My son's favorite part of the game was completing quests...he enjoyed figuring out what he needed and where to go to get them. The scores were close all the way through so neither of us felt like we were beaten before the game came to its conclusion.

The setup of the game takes around 10 minutes alone.  Play takes roughly an hour, give or take a little depending on the familiarity of the players.I won't go into how to play, as it's a fairly complicated game.  Suffice to say that you have only a handful of actions per turn, but copious amounts of choices to make per turn.  Do I try to acquire adventurers so I can complete quests?  Do I play Intrigue cards to derail my opponents?  Do I try to claim the First Player marker so that I go first next round?  Do I build a building and hope to cash in on other players using it?  Do I claim more quests?  Lots and lots of choices, but limited resources to execute them.Strategy in the game revolves around doing quests.  Your ""Lord"" (randomly chosen at the start of the game) determines which types of quests give you bonus points at the end of the game.  However, because the quests available are randomly determined as the game progresses, it's often difficult to capitalize on this bonus.  Since the quests vary greatly in the resources required to complete them, you end up spending your turns debating whether to acquire resources, play (or gather) Intrigue cards to either hinder your opponents or gain resources yourself, or set up plays for future turns.  Generally, the more resources a quest requires, the bigger the payout.  Though the big reward quests are tempting, it's often better to complete multiple smaller quests of your lord's speciality to acquire the bonus points.  You also have to plan ahead to ensure that you're not found wanting a specific adventurerer type or gold in order to complete a quest.I still haven't completely identified a routinely successful strategy to playing the game, though playing at least one agent into Waterdeep Harbor seems to be effective, if you don't require much resources for quests.  The Harbor allows you to not only play an Intrigue card, but also to redeploy your agent at the end of the round.  With good planning, you can play your card AND get the resources that you need.  Too many Intrigue cards end up wasting your time, however, as you won't gain as many resources from playing them as you will get from buildings on the board.  I could go on for pages about various strategies, but ultimately you have to play the game for yourself to determine what works for that particular game.Production quality is very good for the game.  All pieces are either ~2mm thick plastic-coated cardboard or wood.  The Quest and Intrigue cards are plastic-coated as well, much like good playing cards.  Most impressive to me is that the game box contains an insert which neatly stores all of the pieces in various wells dedicated to those pieces.  This allows you to quickly distribute materials and set up the game without having to dig around the box and sort all of the little tokens.  It also makes the box ""tip-resistant"", where flipping it upside-down won't cause all the pieces to go flying around the box.  Granted, some will lose their places, but they're easily retrieved.  My major complaint is with the victory-point tokens and the 1 gold piece markers.  They take some doing to get them to fit in their assigned spots in the insert, but I don't really know how one would improve upon the design to ease the problem.Overall, this isn't a quick or simple game.  It requires some time dedicated to setting up and playing it, and requires a fair amount of thinking and strategizing to play well.  It is absolutely worth getting and playing though.  The replay value of the game is tremendous and the quality of the product will keep it in good playing shape for many games to come.",5.0,Lots and lots of strategy!,1340150400,"06 20, 2012",Toys_and_Games,1.0

It's a D&D-themed; ""Euro Game"" (worker placement game, along the lines of Pillars of the Earth or Agricola).  This seems kind of odd at first, but it actually works quite elegantly, and the theme (for my group, a lapsed-rpg group turned board gamers) really adds to the experience (more so than some of the German games...).If you want to know more about the game, I'd suggest you check out ""The Dice Tower"" video review (that sold me on the game).The production values on the game are *VERY* nice - excellent art, nice cards, etc.  It feels like the game should retail for $10-20 more, and I paid only a fraction of the retail on Amazon.  The rules are very nicely done - well organized, and they've handled just about every corner case we were confused on (something many games fail at).One word of rules caution [And this won't make sense until you've read the rules]: you can complete one quest per TURN (placing an agent), not one quest per ROUND (of which there are only 8).  This resulted in a first game that didn't make a lot of sense, as we couldn't complete very many quests.  However, we immediately played it again correctly, and had a blast.I'm not sure how much replayability there is, as we've only played 3 games so far (ignoring the first game where we didn't understand the rules).  However, some have played very differently than others - I think this is based on what buildings initially show up.  I really hope they make the expansion for this game, as I can see it would ultimately benefit from additional quests, intrigue cards, and buildings; adding another player would be great (they left space on the board for that!).All in all, great game!

There is no move here, pick a card, roll the die(s) kill something, repeat.I suggest going to Wizards of the Coast for the rule FAQ, watch the excellent short How to Play video at the site to get an overview. The game has just enough luck in it to make it interesting, some hidden info, all the no-nos for the hardcore Euro types who like their board games like chess. The game is mildly interactive, read this as cutthroat in hardcore gamer talk, the worst thing that happens is you can take one resource from someone, or give one player a resource as a perk for you picking something up. A lot of other games you can get a leg broken, repeatly, this is not one of them. There are 3 cards that you can give a player that makes them have to fund aka complete the quest on the card before any others he may have. This card you will find you will use sparingly, it may slow down a ""leader"" in the game but you waste effort on your part playing it. It is useful, just requires thought to do so. I suggest you remove these 3 cards in a 2 player game, one player can have all 3 in their hand.

If you want a similar kind of game that does this so much better then look at Tzolk'in &#34;the Mayan Calender&#34; game.

We played it all night and ignored everything else, 3 games in about 6 hours (with a short break to eat, probably about 1.5hrs/game). Once everyone got it down, we were really having some fun. It's really a great game! Not too complex and you can really get into it. I highly recommend it to everyone!Now, I'm going to talk about why it only got 4 stars (although it would be 4.5 if I could):-0.25 stars:11 lord cards. Cool, you think, some variation on bonuses. Wrong. Only one card (6 points per building) will offer anything other than 4 points per any quests from 2 random types. It really is a waste. The first game through, we got wrecked by the guy who had the card for building control, all of us unknowing that it existed. Afterwards we went through the deck...it's the only one of it's type. Seriously?! I understand it's a DnD type and therefore quest-based but I want to be able to do something other than quests to get VPs. I always hope for the building perk, and honestly it's a good one to get. The buildings really benefit you (allowing completion of small plot quests easily) and if you take the 4 gold from Aurora's Realms Shop or 2 from Cliffwatch Inn you can easily buy one per turn. It's so much easier to not have to focus on quests, which is disappointing. I want options. More building benefits. Maybe some lords get more than 4 points for the quests. Maybe some 5 for Arcana and 3 for Commerce...change it up! Make it more intense!-0.25 stars:The intrigue cards. An awesome part of the game, yes. However, often I could only help myself if I helped others. Hurting others? Played those cards every chance I got. But helping others? We usually ended up with a few cards we refused to play for this purpose. I don't want everyone to get an orange/I don't want to give away 4g/I don't want to discard a quest, etc) There wasn't anything that really stuck out as an awesome -power- card to get. Maybe include 1 or 2 strong cards (Take one [?] from every player, take 1G from every player, etc). Even better, set a few cards in a power deck that you can trade buildings for or something. I want more options. More depth. It was frustrating for one player to get 3 terribly, terribly useless intrigue cards when others actually got useful stuff. And the Mandatory Quests...make them harder/more unique! We could usually get them out of the way in one turn. I dealt two to a foe and he did both easily same turn, without actually having the pieces already due to plot quest perks. I'd say make them increase in difficulty based on level in. Same with the other better intrigue cards! At round 5, they become somehow more powerful. It would make the intense endings that much more intense knowing someone could turn the game with one card!Despite all of this, it is still quite a good game. If anything, I'm tempted to make my own cards. If I could match them perfectly (so you couldn't tell them apart by the material/colors/etc) I would make my own Lord Cards, and I still might. This would be a cool option to include also. Either way, when the expansion comes out (August 20th, 2013 according to Amazon) I'll be buying it immediately if not pre-ordering it.

You will notice the Dungeons and Dragons label on the box and in most cases this will either make you very excited about the game or turn you off to it immediately. I for one, have never played Dungeons and Dragons or any other tabletop RPG. I wanted to play this because of all the great things I kept hearing about it and I saw it played on TableTop. Well, all the good things I heard are true and I love this game.Components / Rule BookThis game has a very high quality production value. The first thing you will probably notice is the nice box that the game comes in. The box has a nice finish to it and seems like it will be very durable. It also has a very unique way that the lid and box fit together creating a nice visual effect. Once the box is open, you will notice the amazing plastic insert that will help organize the game components. This insert is probably the best one that I have encountered. Everything has its place and it all fits perfectly. The insert also is designed such that you can very easily retrieve the components from the box without having to tip the thing upside down. Hands down the best use of an insert.Another nice touch to keep the game feeling unique, is the shape and design of the gold used in the game. There are two different types of gold tokens, one is square and the other is a half-moon shape each with a little hole in the middle. I really like this little detail that adds to the theme and just gives another component that stands out above just using a normal round looking coin. The gold tokens are very high quality cardboard type pieces, but they have a nice finish to them and will keep well. Of course, I would have loved actual metal coins, using the cardboard I'm sure keeps the price point down.The game includes a board and building tiles which are also made of some nice cardboard. I am impressed with the building tile pieces from Lords of Waterdeep, because similar tiles in other games seem more prone to warping or just feel flimsy. These tiles are anything but.  The game includes wooden meeples and scoring tokens that are well painted and look nice. The cards used in the game are nice quality and shuffle well.The only thing that I wish was better is the player mats. The mats in my opinion are not a real huge need, but they are nice to have to keep things organized and to keep track of players' factions. These mats divide your completed quests from uncompleted ones and provides a storage area for Adventure Cubes and resources. I really wish these mats were made out of the same material as the building tiles - that would be awesome, but alas, they are not. The mats seem to be printed on a cardstock type material and they are flimsy. They could easily become bent or ruined. Again, I know that it was probably a price point thing and the mats are not necessarily small like the building tiles - but that is really the only part about the components that I found lacking.The instruction booklet is also great quality in material and content. A durable rule book with lots of illustrations and well understood rules. The rule book also provides a diagram on how to use the insert - pretty sweet! I think the quality of components and rule book are top notch.GameplayPlayers are trying to obtain the most victory points by completing quests, building buildings, playing intrigue cards, and by trying to get bonus points from meeting a special goal for your specific Lord. Setup is pretty quick and consists of shuffling some cards and gathering adventurer cubes and other components. Each player gets a Lord of Waterdeep card that will provide bonus points for completing specific types of quests or building buildings. Players will also start with some intrigue cards and some quests.Players will place an agent (one of their meeples) on one of the open action spaces which will allow them to gain adventurers, gold, build a building, gain or play an intrigue card, and take on more quests. Building buildings will add more action spaces to the board and the owner of the building bets a benefit whenever some other player uses that building. Intrigue cards allow you to snare up your opponent with such things as mandatory quests that are required to be completed before completing any other quests. The game really is simple and easy to teach/learn, but the game offers a lot of strategy. The game is a great length as well lasting about an hour (the game is played in 8 rounds and the game is adjusted for the different amount of players by adjusting how many agents a player will start with).Closing ThoughtsI really have enjoyed Lords of Waterdeep. I am just amazed at the nice quality components and the attention to detail for each right down to the wonderful box insert to keep everything organized. I like the little things that make the game have a unique feel like how the box closes or the shape of the gold coins. The artwork is great and all the gameplay with components create a really great theme that is enjoyable and yet isn't overwhelming to those who may not care for fantasy. Those who don't enjoy fantasy at all can still really enjoy this game! It isn't too heavy, so more casual gamers can still enjoy it. The game length is perfect at around 60 minutes. There is variation in the different quest cards, intrigue cards, and building cards used in each game along with the different Lord cards with special bonus point goals. I like the building concept where if you build a building and another player uses that space, you get rewarded. The simplicity of the game combined with the shear fun of completing quests and great strategy depth should make this game shoot to the top of your want list. And with a great player range of 2 to 5 players, this game seems to have it all. It plays really well with 2 players, a lot better than I originally thought it would. I think that there is a lot of replayability and there is also currently one expansion (that apparently is like two in one) available to add even more fun. I hope that I can try it soon as well, for Lords of Waterdeep is amazing and that is How Lou Sees It!A big SHOUT OUT to Wizards of the Coast for making this review possible.",5.0,Lords of Waterdeep is Amazing!,1397606400,"04 16, 2014",Toys_and_Games,1.0

Not that I have a problem with cut throat games, but sometimes you just want to try and fulfill a strategy while dealing with variables (other players) yet these variables aren't always trying to attack you and make you dead. With that said there are certain mechanics like attack intrigue cards. But apart from the mandatory quests, they always affect everyone so it's never personal. The game has a very &#34;Rival organizations vying for power through indirect means&#34; feel, if that makes sense. It's a lot about resource management, which sounds kinda boring, but enhanced by the fantasy theme. So Resources are different classes of adventurers (like wizard or fighter), and you complete quests with them.  It all feels well crafted and I think most people who like board games would enjoy trying to economically dominate in this game.

Connolly III ""Father/Husband/Gamer""","[4, 4]","I'm a big fan of games with good theme, so I was a reluctant to pick this game up after reading other reviews that were saying the theme was just added on to the mechanics.  But... I'm fan of worker placement games... and I'm a D&D; player from way back.  So, I pulled the trigger...so to speak.I'm glad I did.  This game is fun, has good design elements, and great production value.Production:The box and insert for this game are just awesome. I have lots of games where the insert seems to be an after thought (I'm looking at you FFG).  The box is unique but functional and the insert is one of the best I've seen.  The insert holds all the bits and makes them easy to get to and easy to store and even has beveled sections that allow you to easily remove the components. The manual also has a section dedicated to showing you how to store the pieces.  One of the best box designs ever.Game Play:There is plenty of player interaction unlike many Euro type games.  Simply put, you are placing workers to collect resources that you turn in for points.  However, you can see what every other player is attempting to collect and you have the option to delay and interfere with them if you want.  Every turn has plenty of options and I didn't really get the feeling, like I do with a lot of Euros, that the game was playing me.  The game is simple to teach and moves along pretty quickly.Theme:The theme is just a layer on top of the mechanics, but I did enjoy it.  The resource collection aspect of the game manifests as ""quests"" that you complete/turn in.  The resources are your typical D&D; types: Clerics, Rogues, Wizards, and Fighters.  As I was playing I found myself looking more at the items I needed to collect and not the quest itself.  The game takes place in the very popular Forgotten Realms city of Waterdeep.  I've read a number of the books and have enjoyed roleplaying in this campaign setting so I think that helped fill in some of the gaps that a tightly integrated theme normally fills.Final Thoughts:This game will have a permanent place on my shelf.

Caylus, in my opinion, is quite difficult to explain to new players. Consider Lords of Waterdeep to be a gateway game to the more advanced worker placement games. Instead of stacking cubes of resources to build a castle, you send out ""agents"" who hire cubes of ""adventurers"" which complete quest cards for points and resources. Actions are taken immediately, similar to Agricola, and points are scored instantaneously on a scoring track, so you can roughly keep track of points as you go. The wrinkle is that each player plays as a Lord of Waterdeep with a secret agenda to score points at the end of the game (for example 4 points per Warfare and Acarna type quests, or 6 points per building you have built). The game plays quickly, and the icons on the board are very readable. Additionally it is very easy to teach. The Dungeons and Dragons theme will probably hook more people than the relatively dry Caylus. This is a game that will get a lot of play on my table.",5.0,Great gateway to more complex worker placement games (I'm looking at you Caylus),1333411200,"04 3, 2012",Toys_and_Games,1.0

All the bits have a home, and it's easy to get everything in and out.  This is one of the few games I've got where I didn't immediately grab a whole bunch of zip-top plastic bags to store everything in.  The game instructions even include a map to show where every piece should go.

I'll leave a detailed explanation of the game mechanics to others, but suffice it to say, it's only related to Dungeons & Dragons thematically.  It's a pretty good worker (called agents in the game) placement game, and you usually have tough choices on where to send your agents and how to react to the other players choices.There's a bit of randomness in that the game uses some cards and stacks (namely buildings, quests and intrigue), but it's not a ""swingy"" randomness.  I think it enhances the game in that you'll always have a slightly different experience.I've played with 2 players or 4, and it played pretty well with those numbers.

Lets take a look.COMPONENTSThe board is completely functional.  Your player markers are completely functional.  The cards are OK.  Some of the text on them is a bit small and difficult for people not right next to them to read.  Money is cardboard chits and are a bit weird, but once you get used to which shape/size is what value, it's good enough.  Everything else?  Cubes.  Warriors?  Cubes.  Wizards?  Cubes.GAMEPLAYYou take turns placing your workers which let you take quests or resources to complete those quests and/or draw/play cards, and then if you can/want to, you then spend resources to complete one of your quests.  Completing a quest gives you points and many times, more resources to spend later.  Additionally, you can take an action to &#34;buy&#34; a new action space to be put on the board (which you can take or, if anyone else takes it, you get a kickback for owning it).Additionally, there are some hidden bonuses for completing certain types of quests (each player has different hidden goals).  What it really ends up meaning is, if you're lucky and can get goals which don't have a lot of competition (so others aren't taking your quests) and are lucky enough for your type of quests to show up as being available, you get a few extra points.  It's generally not game-altering.All in all, the gameplay is very solid.  My only problem with the gameplay is the cards.  Far too many of them are very &#34;take that&#34; play against one other player.  So if you're in the lead, get ready to get &#34;blue shelled&#34; quite a bit.  As a lighter game, that's not the worst thing in the world.THEMEThe theme is recruiting a small army to go on quests and do cool things, which will look familiar to those familiar to the D&D; lore.  In reality, the game always seems to come down to people paying attention to nothing but colors of cubes to collect and colors of cubes on the cards.  If the cubes were meeples of what they were representing, it would be much easier to feel the theme.  If the different types of quests actually felt different, that would help as well.  As is, it just feels like collecting resources to complete your shopping list.  The theme is a major letdown.CONCLUSIONIf you look at the reviews on Amazon for this game, you'll see literally nothing below 3 stars.  And you know why that is?  It's impossible to hate this game.  Unfortunately, if you know the better options for this type of game, you'll realize it's not easy to love, either.  The mechanics are mostly sound, but there's nothing that stands out anywhere.  The theme isn't there.  And there's better options for simpler worker placement games (The Manhattan Project, Alien Frontiers) to use to teach newer board gamers.

I have enjoyed worker placement games like Stone Age, and this game is a nice addition to that genre.  It's a bit complicated for the novice game player, hence why I didn't give it the highest rating, but it has a good dynamic and the D&D theme is blended sweetly into the mechanics.  If you enjoy worker placement games, you will be attracted to this one.  I also liked the intrigue cards that provide a way to slow down an opponent who is gaining too much momentum.  This simple addition adds game balance that some worker placement games (like Phoenicia) lack.  The secrecy of which Lord of Waterdeep that you represent throughout the game also adds to this balance.  It takes a solid two hours to play the game (at least with my group of friends/gamers), so it's not a light play, but that doesn't detract its appeal for me since I play many games of that nature.  However, if you have limited time for your gaming, this is not the game for you.  It also has a lot of bits and pieces, so play does involve some organization and time consumption in setting up and putting it away.  That many bits also means that you want to be careful about not losing any since each of the pieces are instrumental to the game's play.  It is definitely not a travel game due to this and the size of the box.

The D&D; aspect of this game is only in theme or the &#34;skin&#34; of the game. The gameplay has nothing to do with roleplaying like traditional D&D; dungeon crawlers with a Game Master and 12 sided dice. This game is a worker placement game with a ton of randomness which makes the replay-ability of the game extremely high. To give some examples, there are 12-ish standard places to put a worker at the start of the game, but then there are 24 buildings that can be purchased throughout the game which add another space for each worker to be placed. Another random part in the game is the Lord cards. Each player draws or is dealt a random person, which they conceal from the other players. Each person has a different end game victory point award system, which can (and usually is) the deciding factor for the game. My absolute favorite part of the game is that there is a space that allows a player to become the first player in the next round. This effectively changes who is last as well, and my family gets into battles about who will take that spot.The game is just mechanically awesome, and is appealing to anyone that likes a fun family strategy game. My sister-in-law LOATHES the thought of dungeons and dragons, and I convinced her to play this at least 3 times before she said she hated it. After the first time playing, this became her favorite game. It's almost annoying how fun this game is because everyone prefers to play this over munchkin, ticket to ride, pandemic, and a slew of other games.TLDR; Mechanically awesome worker placement game.

Players spend their resources to satisfy quest which grant points and sometimes other special abilities. The game has a nice story arc as players game more workers to place and more locations in which to place them as the game progresses.

As with all good games, there's a lot of variety in play decisions and lots of strategies to go for depending on the cards you get. With each person having a hidden 'role' to give them a potential bonus at the end, it's hard to tell who is winning. I think the builder role card is a bit too rewarding, but it is what it is. I just hate being the only one going after 'the builder' to keep them from getting points, because i tend to not be able to adapt a winning strategy for myself.

Tresca ""Talien""","[20, 33]","Waterdeep is probably only marginally familiar to most Dungeons & Dragons players, and only those who play in the Forgotten Realms.  Unlike the other, wilder parts of the Forgotten Realms like Neverwinter, Waterdeep is a much more stable city, which means it has much more possibilities for political intrigue. Wizards of the Coast decided to take the D&D; brand in a different direction by creating a ""Euro-style"" game in which the pen is mightier than the sword.Players take the role of powerful lords vying for control of Waterdeep, leveraging its treasures and resources to gain an advantage.  The Lords influence the city through agents, who in turn recruit adventurers.Waterdeep's presentation is gorgeous.  There are a variety of wooden meeples (agents), blocks (adventurers), four different kinds of cards, and thick card stock representing buildings, gold coins, and victory points.  Players take on one of five different organizations in the form of play mats, which assigns each player a color.Game play consists of creating buildings, sending agents, recruiting adventurers, and then sending said adventurers (different colors help differentiate their classes) on quests. The cards complicate these goals, concluding after eight rounds of play.I have nothing against this style of play, but I'm not entirely sure what it has to do with Dungeons & Dragons.  The branding from 4th Edition is nowhere in evidence.  The adventurers are just wooden blocks instead of plastic miniatures.  You don't actually roll any dice.  And last I heard, no one was clamoring for the intrigues of Waterdeep.There's nothing wrong with Lords of Waterdeep, it's just a surprising departure of the D&D; brand in a direction that's going after the adult boardgamer - use of the word ""Euro-style"" is a phrase aimed specifically at them - but it's a category I don't fit into. Euro-style games usually involve players negotiating with each other, but there's little of that in evidence here - it's more a resource game than a dialogue.That said, Lords of Waterdeep does resource strategy very well. At eight rounds it's all over quickly and players will need to maximize their every resource to win in such a short period of time. Waterdeep seems to be more of a gateway game for board gamers to become more interested in the D&D; brand than the other way around.There's one thing that will appeal to gamers of the Forgotten Realms however: the coins make an excellent prop!",3.0,For board game fans,1334793600,"04 19, 2012",Toys_and_Games,0.0

In Waterdeep, you acquire adventurers to complete quests to earn victory points.  It's a lot of fun.  We even play it with my 7 year old son.

You accumulate victory points chiefly by completing quests, to which you must commit substantial resources. Your turns are spent in acquiring the resources via agents who visit certain locations. The mechanic that dictates that only one agent may claim a site's resource creates tension as you wait impatiently for your turn. The selection of quests is key to your success - but the quests are also a first-come, first-served resource, so there is tension in deciding whether to first grab the choice quest, or try to acquire scarce resources that can be used for any of the quests that you do pick up.I rated this only 4 stars solely because of the components and packaging. The odd shapes of the markers are very fiddly to align so that they will fit into the formed tray. You're perhaps better advised to pitch the sorting tray and keep the markers in baggies. The half-height box lid fails at whatever purpose the designer had in mind.

I checked out the new 4th edition tabletop game when it first came out, and over a brief period of time it fell out of favor with me. D&D; 4e can be a fun game, but it lost something for me in all the focus on tactical combat. The more recent D&D; board game entries from Wizards of the Coast seemed like they took tabletop D&D; and turned it into a simple board game.The 4e connection to Lords of Waterdeep is what worried me. As it turns out, there is no tabletop D&D; to be found in this game. Instead, it takes the city of Waterdeep as the setting, and allows you to be a secret ruler sending out adventurers on quests to collect victory points.As a tabletop D&D; gamer, I instantly found an attraction to this game soon after learning how to play. The thought of being the person in charge of gathering adventurers and sending them out to do my bidding was very appealing to me; finally I would get a sense of how it feels to be on the other side of the adventure. Sure, I've run games as the Dungeon Master before, but the Lords of Waterdeep are essentially non-player characters; extras in the background that the players don't get to interact with very often. To make these powerful extras take centerstage as playable characters was an exciting prospect to me.As a board game collector, I was extremely impressed with the packaging. After you have punched out all the cardboard pieces and followed the guide provided in the instructions, everything is sorted and organized to facilitate fast setup. Every group of tokens, meeples, cards, and tiles is separated into their own tightly constructed compartment. Once the board is placed on top and the box closed, there is little fear that the pieces will be a headache-inducing jumble and/or damaged from handling when next you open it up to play. It is this kind of attention to detail that can win big points with me, as there are a number of other board games I own that do not have sorted compartments in the box. This usually results in me putting pieces into ziploc sandwich baggies to help avoid having to sort everything out every time I want to play. With Lords of Waterdeep, I open the box and get into playing the game a lot sooner, and the condition of the game pieces is maintained while the game is transported and stored.As a board game player, this is a basic resource gathering game that has the backing of a D&D; setting. The artwork is gorgeous, the flavor text ties in very well with the lore of Waterdeep, and it plays super fast. The wooden pieces are a nice break from the plastic parts and cardboard standees of other games. After reading the rules and test playing once, I never had to go back to the rule book in subsequent plays. Everything is laid out visually, with relatively little game mechanic text. What effects or instructions that are listed on the cards and tiles are very clear and easy to understand, and you can tell at a glance what resources you and your opponents need to complete their quests. The designers stated they wanted to create a board game where you could figure out how to play from just looking at the board. I feel they have succeeded in their attempt. The game only plays for 8 rounds, and most of the time this will be accomplished in about an hour, maybe and hour and a half max, even with 5 players. Although at full 5 players your victory point scores will likely be lower than in a 3-person game, the challenge of working your resources against four other ""Lords"" can be quite fun.So why not a 5-star review? This is a pretty basic resource Euro-game, and there is little in the rules regarding interactions with other players other than trying to stop them from collecting resources and/or victory points. There is no mention of being able to strike alliances with the other ""Lords"", make trades, and other such activities that really make a player try to work with the other players to accomplish their goals in an attempt to win. It is this one aspect that I feel makes a Euro-game really soar in enjoyment; you are competing with each other, but you cannot win on your own. With Lords of Waterdeep, the rules are very basic and straight-forward, and win conditions do not require you to work with your opponents at all. The allusion in the rule book to a possible expansion containing a sixth faction is nice, but if it only offers a new faction and does not expand the game with new gameplay options then I would feel the potential for this game's future will have been squandered.Don't get me wrong; this is a fast and fun resource game. I find the packaging and quality of the game parts to be worth the price, if only to vote with my dollars for such packaging and quality in future products. That it also plays well is a rare find. However, D&D; for me shines in it being a role-playing game where the players actually role-play their characters, and I'll likely experiment with offering trades and alliances to encourage players to aid and/or backstab each other. After all you are the Lords of Waterdeep, the most powerful people in the city.

However gathering the adventurers requires some planning and strategy, because other players will occupy spaces on the board you need to gather those adventurers, and the spaces are usually limited to one person only.  You also have to watch out for other players burdening you with cards from their Intrigue deck, where they can give you missions that require your adventurers for small numbers of points, or give them a temporary advantage.

Unfortunately I really hated it b/c we typically only play 2 players and it mostly made me angry due to scarcity of resources. In response I got her Lords of Waterdeep b/c it was lauded as a resource game, but much less complex/easier than Agricola and it's been an absolute blast to the point my mother in law (50+) and niece (4) can follow and play this game with much enjoyment. We've played it so much the board is starting to come apart!Note that I am the only one in the family that grew up on D&D; styled IP. My wife typically hates fantasy and sci-fi type stuff, but she was able to pick this up w/o any problems. She doesn't really read the card or pay attention to the art and most wants 'orange guys or purple guys' as opposed to warriors or mages. Fans of the game will appreciate some quest names like Domesticate Owlbears.Since we're a casual boardgame family we don't play with mandatory quests or practice resource denial strategies so it's more like a resource 'race' (like ticket to ride) so it's less intense towards the end of the game and easier to have runaway leaders, but due to the lord bonuses and just general randomness of which lord you get, quests, and buildings that are available, it's maintained it's replayability for us and since there's an expansion out, I don't see this game hitting the cupboard anytime soon.We've taught this game to multiple friends with varying levels of boardgame experience (usually little to none or some settlers experience) and it has always been easy for them to pick up and often they'll want to play again after we finish.We recommend playing with 3 people as 4 people matches take really long. There are limited rounds, which is good, but adding a fouth person increases the number of turns and agents quite a bit b/c there's also more competition over spots b/c you can only build a single building per round w/o intrigue cards or special spots.",5.0,Lords of Fun,1386633600,"12 10, 2013",Toys_and_Games,1.0

If you are a dungeon game fanatic with no euro experience, you also should keep reading. This game is a straight euro-style game, with a clever fantasy theme wrapped around it. Mechanically, it runs on worker placement and resource management principles. There are some cool cards, but the game pieces are... drumroll... wooden cubes. And some meeples. And some victory point tokens. Eurogamers will rejoice, and dungeon crawl gamers might be surprised. You won't find any miniatures here.But this is far from an average euro with cubes. It is actually a very well designed game, with many winning ways to approach it. The object is to complete Quest cards, which each show cube requirements (called adventurers) and rewards. Four types of ""adventurers"" are represented by cubes. Orange for fighters, white for clerics, black for rogues, and purple for wizards. Quests cards are colored as well. So an orange Quest (called a warfare quest) requires, as its main element, orange cubes. White Quest cards require white cubes, etc. But each will usually require a lesser amount of other resources, such as gold or other colored cubes. Victory points are rewarded for completed quests, and a few other hidden bonus points are awarded at the end.Standard stuff, right? No.This game works so well because it is fairly quick, and actions are tightly controlled because of limited places on the board to deploy your agents to obtain resources. Think Stone Age, but without as much scoring complication. It's not exactly the same, but similar. In addition to getting and completing quests, you can obtain and play Intrigue cards, which give you various actions. Other actions you can take include getting gold, and purchasing buildings. Buildings provide more spots for players to place agents, and each building gives that player more resources. Owners of the buildings also get something each time another player uses it.There are elements of several different types of games here, and they all work extremely well together. The fantasy theme provides a nice backdrop, complete with ""flavor text"" on cards and fantasy-type names assigned to buildings and pieces. It all provides extra enjoyment, added to a fine euro-style game. It's easy to teach and learn, and with one game under your belt you'll be flying through the next game. And you'll probably keep coming back, because strategies that work depend on each game and how the other players play. Replay value is high, as far as I can tell from a limited number of games so far. Everyone who has played this with me has enjoyed it, and complaints are few and minor. It's an excellent game, and one I purchased after just one play, which is quite rare for me. Hope you enjoy it!",5.0,Is this good? You better believe it!,1333065600,"03 30, 2012",Toys_and_Games,1.0

If you're looking at buying this you probably already knew that.  It's fairly easy to teach and learn and it plays fast.  It's also pretty good across the spectrum of players.LoW's theme rests almost entirely on the flavor text on the cards.  I've never been a D&D; player, but I've been told that D&D; players really like the flavor text on the cards, that it helps immerse them in the game.  This is exactly why I'm giving the game three stars despite all the positives.This game, if you ignore the flavor text, has almost zero theme.  It's pushing cubes around, collecting, redeeming them for points, rinse, repeat.  Now, lots of Euros have this.  I happen to enjoy many of those games.  The problem here is that LoW is specifically trying to sell a theme and, for me and at least some other players, it does not deliver.The cubes in this game are supposed represent people.  This is the crux of why I don't buy the mechanic=theme one iota.  In Stone Age, for example, you send a ""worker"" out to collect things such as food, stone, wood or gold.  Makes total sense to me.  And I don't even think Stone Age is even that thematic when put up against Ameritrash games.  In LoW you are ""recruiting"" cubes . . . um, I mean ""wizards"" or something like that . . . to fulfill tasks.  So the ""workers"" in LoW are recruiters.  Sorry, doesn't work for me.I won the very first game of LoW game I played.  I knew exactly why I won - I used an Intrigue card as one of my last plays to cripple the leader while at the same time had enough resources to jump forward (from fourth place no less) well ahead of everyone else.  Loved playing it.  But I could say the same thing about ANY of my favorite Euro board games.  Which brings me to the only thing I truly love about this game: the take that/screwage Intrique cards.  Other than that, this game is just about like any other game.LoW is a game I enjoy playing and would probably never turn down a game.  It is, however, bland.  I'm not alone in having this opinion.  If you're not a D&D; fan and/or you prefer games to have more theme than flavor text then you might feel the same.It's clear many people love this game and I understand why.  One of the major selling points for LoW is that it plays fairly quickly for its genre.  This can be a major selling point for a family or game group.  This is one reason I don't feel I need to own this game - someone else can own it and bring it to game night.Know what kind of player you are.  LoW might be a great game for you.  It is not for me.  I haven't played it yet, but I'm looking at picking up the Manhattan Project which also has screwage and, allegedly, theme.  We'll see.Edit:I see that my review is getting most negs.  With that in mind:There is a flaw here that game fans should be able to accept and not neg this review.  In most worker placement games your workers actually do something - they collect, buy, etc.  The ""recruitment"" mechanism in LoW is a degree of separation that simply does not exist in most other worker placement games.  As a result, one could re-theme LoW even faster than other such type games.  You could quickly change D&D; flavor text to managing sports teams or the corporate world, both of which involve recruiting.When a game's theme is that interchangeable, that you can quickly change flavor text and have a brand new game with the exact same mechanisms  - that's a flaw.  That's an indication of lack of theme in the worst way.  It also shows a huge amount of dishonesty on the part of the fanboys that a reviewer can't write these things without having the review dinged.  LoW has many positive attributes which I have pointed out. Theme is not one of them.

LoW is limited to 8 turns, unlike the drawn out Agricola, and also unlike Agricola, there is no rush to gather more people to accomplish your goals - your Agents are determined at the start of each game by the number of players.  A variation on Agricola's theme of placing a set number of placards in random order, is the option for a variety of buildings cards, the entire stack of which is not possible to all be built in a single game so you never know which opportunities you might have to develop in that regard (also similar to 7 Wonders age 3 Guilds and Cities expansion Spies cards).Another game-to-game variation is the Lords cards, of which each player is dealt one randomly at the start of the game. These cards determine the type of Quests for which you gain extra Victory Points when scoring is accomplished at the end of the game.  In this way, scoring is similar to Ticket to Ride in tallying up the Quest bonuses, similar to the Destination cards in that game.  While Agricola uses a scoring method more similar to 7 Wonders, with all tallying of points done at the end of the game and no one ever really being sure how they fare against their opponents during the game itself, Lords of Waterdeep grants victory points during the game, again similar to Ticket to Ride, and then again at the end based on your Lord, as previously noted.  The basic 'win' concept is to gain VP's by using adventurers (and gold), who are gained by placing Agents on buildings to acquire them, to complete Quests.  You gain extra VP's based on the type of Quests you've completed from your Lord at the end of the game, but since your Lord is secret from your opponents, the type of Quests that you get bonuses from is also kept secret.While Agricola faces challenges of balancing long-term game strategy over short-term gains, LoW allows for a better mix because of these variations on the theme.  Fewer turns, more visible scoring, and less difficulty determining how to proceed - short term vs. long term, because there really isn't enough time to separate the two and everyone has the same number of chances to gain benefits each turn, unlike Agricola's 'family' building element.Lastly, I can really appreciate the plastic case in the box for which there's even a diagram of how to place the various pieces and cards.  I had a bunch of plastic baggies all ready to go, and I saw that diagram, I know it sounds funny, but I got really excited that Wizards of the Coast thought ahead enough for this type of game to grant the owner the option to have a safe, effective, neat, organized way to store it.

I guess it's an exceptional attempt. Heh. This is my new favorite.As is often the case with European style games, there's lots of chits and bits and pages of instructions, but the game mechanics are fundamentally pretty simple: It's a resource gathering game and you can use the resources to buy buildings or complete quests. Between those primary goals and some assorted plays during the game, you'll accrue victory points and s/he with the most at the end of 8 rounds wins. Resources are gold and 'adventurers' in the flavors of white, purple, black or orange (cleric, wizard, rogue, fighter, respectively). The 'Lord of Waterdeep' that you represent influences your victory strategy a little bit, but mostly just in terms of which quests you favor, not in style of play. Intrigue cards, quest benefits and different benefits of the respective buildings alter your strategy a little during game play. For example, if you complete a quest that gives you a few victory points every time you construct a building, then you'll probably make that a slightly higher priority. Every turn is interesting because you have that decision to make between which resources, building or quest to grab before an opponent does.One thing that sold me (based on reviews) is that you can make a mistake and still win the game. It's not like if you didn't know some bit of rules or strategy that you ruin your chance to win on the first turn. You can play the game and enjoy it even if it seems you're losing because there's always hope until the last turn. Another thing I liked is the game doesn't require you to be cut-throat to win. I suppose you could make a point of ensuring your fellow player(s) can't get the resources they need to complete a quest, but there really are a lot of options available to them so it's not like you could shut them out entirely and you'd be hurting your own chances if you tried.The bottom line is this game is my new favorite. I still like 7 Wonders for fast, fun play, but if i have a bit more time, I'm going to want to play this over Settlers of Catan or Ticket to Ride or others. If I had one critique, I'm a little let down with the Lords. There are 11 of them and with one exception, they all give 4 victory points for every (this) or (that) quest completed, say Skullduggery or Piety. The exception is the Lord that gives you victory points for owning buildings. That might be a bit of a handicap because there are only 8 'natural' opportunites to build a building. Your opponents could beat you to the punch. There are a couple of quests and I think at least one Intrigue card that give you an opportunity to build a building, but you could easly see those slip through your grasp, too.  I just think they should have done something so it felt like the different Lords had different goals and I have several ideas how it could have been done. I'm a little surprised they made the Lords so 'cookie cutter.'",5.0,Just buy it,1356393600,"12 25, 2012",Toys_and_Games,1.0

I'm pleased that Wizards included this iconic figure in the set. Compared to Cormyr, I found the choice of humanoid sculpts to be a bit less varied and interesting, the paints to be less dramatic and perhaps a notch down in quality. Even then, they are better than most of the random packs that I've purchased.Gameplay: The Order and Creature cards provide a unique and varied play experience compared to the Cormyr game. Cormyr includes creature abilities that tend to allow you to shield or heal other creatures. By contrast, Lloth relies more on Order cards to interrupt attacks. In Magic the Gathering terms, this plays a bit more like a Blue Interrupt deck compared to Cormyr's White Blocking and Healing deck. They balance each other well, straight out of the box. In my first game with my daughter, she won with 1 morale left after the tide turned three times during the game (bring in the reinforcements!).A correction to the product description - there are two Commander cards in the game box.Once again, the minis and tiles are compatible with the Adventure Series board games.I've purchased both Cormyr and Lloth and am so happy with them that I've now pre-ordered the next two batches.

The more closely I read the secondhand descriptions of gameplay mechanics the more my fear and anger were kindled toward the yet unreleased product. However, one aspect of the game piqued my interest enough to keep the game on my radar and that was the nonrandom faction packs. Randomized miniatures, I felt, was the bane of previous editions and it had almost alienated me due to my financial conscience. My fear of buying blind packs only to discover I had wasted yet more money on another Tri-Horn Behemoth miniature is enough to cause unrestful nights to this day. Nevertheless, it was with a bit of fear and trepidation I ordered the initial Dungeon Command sets.My initial thought upon pulling Sting of Lolth and Heart of Cormyr from the shipping box was that the game boxes themselves are nowhere near as cheap as they've been made out to be. While the quality of the storage box isn't as high as say Castle Ravenloft, it's still of a very sturdy make and will not be as easily destroyed as I had feared. Not only is the box good, but so is the actual storage system which holds the game components. Everything has its place, and once sorted and closed everything remains where it's placed.Anyone who's played or collected D&D; miniatures before will see some familiar faces, albeit with new makeovers. If you happen to own the D&D; Adventure System Games you'll definitely see some old friends return in the Sting of Lolth and Heart of Cormyr, but boy howdy they've never looked better. While some of the miniatures I received with the D&D; Adventure System Games are slightly bent or warped, the Sting of Lolth and Heart of Cormyr miniatures are in perfect form thanks to the storage tray. Not one miniature has a bent sword, staff, or arching base. I'm saddened that new sculpts aren't a part of Dungeon Command, but I'm willing to give the recycled miniatures a pass simply because they look good and are of nice quality. Veterans and newcomers alike should be pleased.The rulebook included is attractive but not on a par with the quality found in the D&D; Adventure System Game entries, this one being made of a thick non glossy stock. It is, however, simple to follow and proved more than easy to read through while playing our family's first game. Setup is a simple matter of connecting the dungeon tiles, picking out a commander card, shuffling two decks of cards (Creature deck and Order deck), and deploying starting creatures. From there, every turn, players go through the same four sequences (remeber: untap your characters before ending your turn!) until one player runs out of morale or ends a turn with no characters on the board. After getting through our first game and becoming more familiar with the various cards of the two factions, our playtime *averages* about 35 minutes.The one thing you'll hear again and again is that the gameplay mechanics are the offspring of a DUNGEONS & DRAGONS and Magic: The Gathering union. This is without question the one aspect of the game that will cast you as either a supporter or a dissenter. While, yes, they've abandoned the d20 in favor of cards, the game's spirit has remained true to the original. Removing dice rolls from a DUNGEONS & DRAGONS product might seem sacrilegious to the Church of Gygax (hallowed be thy name), but it appears that the decision to rely on the use of cards instead of dice has shaken up the gameplay as it has drastically changed its nature by putting more focus on skill rather than luck. True, there is fortune involved with the draw of cards but having the `best card' is pointless if your execution is flawed -- dice can no longer serve as your scapegoat for a failed game!In an attempt to rejuvenate the D&D; Miniatures Game Wizards of the Coast shows a willingness to be innovative by removing or drastically altering basic foundations of previous entries. This may alienate veterans, though it may also prove refreshing. My fears of seeing a new D&D; Miniatures Game may have been founded in the ghost of gaming past, but I would have to admit that Dungeon Command isn't the monster I feared.",4.0,The Spotted Cuckoo is Flying Backwards,1343174400,"07 25, 2012",Toys_and_Games,1.0

Tresca ""Talien""","[12, 13]","When the global economy went south and the cost of importing products from China went up, the miniature market took a severe hit.  Miniatures are often molded and painted overseas, which requires a considerable amount of manpower.  To make up the cost of creating and shipping the miniatures, they were sold in blind, randomized packs to ensure that every miniature sold at a minimum base value. When shipping and production costs went up, this tactic became less effective and Wizards of the Coast pulled their Dungeons & Dragons miniatures line entirely. Now they're back with Dungeon Command.Wizards has found considerable success in adapting the 4th Edition Dungeons & Dragons rules to the board game market with the Adventure System, a distribution channel long overdue given that the company is owned by Hasbro.  Dungeon Command heralds Wizards' return to the miniature market as its own skirmish game, as game pieces for other Adventure System board games like The Legend of Drizzt...and oh yeah, for tabletop role-playing games.Instead of being released in random packs, you know exactly what you get with Dungeon Command.  Sting of Lolth consists of a drow wizard, assassin, blademaster, and priestess, two house guards, a shadow mastiff, two demonweb spiders, a giant spider, an umber hulk, and a partridge in a pear tree! Ahem, no sorry, the last component is a...drider?As D&D; miniatures supporting a tabletop role-playing game campaign this is a good spread - any Dungeon Master utilizing the drow will need a priestess for the matriarchal drow society and her spider minions. What's curious is the inclusion of the half-drow/half-spider driders (see what they did there?), who are considered abominations by the drow and highly unlikely to be part of a warband.For Adventure System players there are 12 monster cards (aligning with each of the miniatures) and four interlocking terrain cards.If you just want to play the skirmish game, you really should buy another opposing faction (see what they did there?).  But there are rules to play a shortened game with the miniatures you have - after all, it wouldn't be the first time drow fought each other.The real surprise is that there are no dice in this game. Yes, no dice.  Randomized elements are reserved through command cards and creature cards, which are tapped and untapped.  So this is basically Magic: The Gathering meets Dungeons & Dragons.I'll wait for the traditional D&D; gamers to stop screaming.What's great about this set is its utility.  Drow have a strong theme that warrants a collection of this type, and because they miniatures are prepainted (unlike the unpainted miniatures for the Adventure System) the components can be used three different ways.  In essence, Wizards didn't create a new game system, they just provided new ways to use old miniatures.

Before buying, I read multiple reviews and advice from publisher that two faction packs would be optimal.  After having played the game, I can say that two faction packs are essential--don't try to play without two.  The gameplay just doesn't lend itself ""sharing"" decks and figures.  It would be like trying to play chess with two players and you both share all the same color pieces. But once you have two faction packs, you're ready to go!On the surface, the game appears to be much more complicated than it truly is.  A quick flip through the rulebook (10+ pages including diagrams, side bars and bold print vocab words) may incite panicked flash backs to your high school chemistry book.  However, if you just buckle down for a few minutes, the gameplay truly only takes about 10-15 minutes to get cozy with.  By the end of your first game, you'll be dungeon delving like a pro!Gameplay:  This is a very fun hybrid trading card game/strategy board game using creatures and denizens of the famous Dungeons and Dragons fantasy world.  This particular faction pack includes followers of the evil spider queen Lolth (drow, spiders and beasts of the Underdark).  You will battle your creatures against your opponents using each creature's unique abilities (as printed on their card) and bolster your offenses/defenses using your hand of ""order"" cards.  There's very little luck involved, since you won't be rolling dice and you will quickly gain access to your entire arsenal of creatures.  However, you will need to bank on drawing useful order cards from your deck.One of the things that I like about this game is that it is very easy to set up, tear down and re-setup if need be.  My boyfriend and I sometimes only get an hour or so to play and we'll need to start and stop a single game a few times before someone wins.  That being said, the producer claims a game can last anywhere from 45-120 minutes.  We have yet to have a game last under 2 hours, however, we are strategy game veterans and tend to take these matches very seriously. (We even have a scoreboard in our living room for bragging and nagging rights.)Altogether, the game play seems nicely balanced between factions.  The Drown are rather powerful (high hit points, high damage abilities) however they lack healing capabilities and don't have particularly strong ranged attack power.  So, you'll need to get close to your enemy, hit fast and hard, and then get out of the way.One minor complaint I have regarding this faction pack in particular is the fact that I have several order cards in my deck that appear to not be useable by any of my creatures.  For example: I have a level 1 INT card that allows spider creatures to cast web on an opponent, limiting their movement.  However, this pack doesn't contain any spider creatures that have INT.  I'm not sure if the designers did this having intended to allow players customize their own ""decks"" of creatures, but even still, you should be able to use all of the cards in the deck that comes with the set. My boyfriend's Heart of Cormyr set has similar cards with limitations.Despite these quirks, the game itself is great fun and really lends itself to modifications, add-ons and customization.  We have already been talking about including traps and special loot items on the board and possibly writing in scenarios for wandering monsters and random encounters.  It can easily be merged with the adventure game systems that Wizards of the Coast has released.  The best thing about it: you can make it as simple or as complicated as you want.Quality/Components: The faction pack contains miniatures from previous D&D; miniature releases (with the exception of the newest Blood of Gruumsh pack, which has all new miniatures).  They are pre-painted and very handsomely detailed.  The miniatures are excellent quality and very attractive.You will also receive two ""large"" dungeon tiles and two ""small"" dungeon tiles, one of which will contain your starting zone.  All of the tiles are double-sided, displaying outdoor terrain on one side and an indoor dungeon floor on the opposite side.  They can be arranged in a couple of different ways for variations and/or strategy purposes.  Our dungeon tiles were a bit warped and won't lie flat when we put them out on the table to create a game board (see pictures).  This has been pretty annoying so far and we are trying to find a way to ""flatten"" them back out.You will also receive game cards for the adventure system, allowing you to integrate your creatures into the other current Wizards of the Coast Dungeons and Dragons games. Since I already own theLegend of Drizztgame, this was a nice bonus for me.Overall: Dungeon Command should appeal to anyone who enjoys or more of the following:- Trading Card Games (Pokemon, Magic, WoW TCG, etc...)- Dungeons and Dragons Tabletop RPG (or Pathfinder)- Strategy Games (Analog or Digital)- Hero Cliks and other similar miniature-based gamesThis is a great game for fantasy gurus and people who like the idea of trading card games like Magic, but love having a board with pieces to move. If you happen to be a fan of D&D; and the lore of the realms, then this is a must-play game for you. A+",5.0,Awesome D&D strategy game,1362960000,"03 11, 2013",Toys_and_Games,1.0

I've played with my daughter (who's turned out to be quite good, by the way) and I've found the system to be relatively quick to catch on to but with the same layers of tactical depth afforded by Magic the Gathering (MtG) - all in a familiar D&D; wrapper.Even with the single Cormyr set we found the game to be engaging and varied. Adding the Lloth set increases the options, but is by no means necessary. We got a lot of enjoyment out of the single boxed set.Mini paints are better than most of the random packs that I purchased back in the day.Gameplay has a lot of variety afforded by:- the unique powers of each creature/mini- the ""special action"" order cards that you draw and play, MtG style (complete with an Interrupt mechanic)- the different capabilities and overarching focus of the Commanders (two per game box)- the ability to set the puzzle tile board up in a few different ways (with both wilderness and dungeon printed on opposite sides of the tiles)- a minor random element of treasure placementFor those who have purchased the Adventure Series board games, the minis and tiles are compatible. Special cards and punch out tokens are provided to serve as a supplement to those games.As for value, you get triple service:A stand-alone MtG-style Skirmish Game that can also serve as...D&D; accessories: A dozen minis and a handful of tilesAdventure Series Expansion: see above, plus the proper related cards and punch out tokensThe only improvement that I'd recommend is that the rules could be a bit clearer. Specifically, they would have benefited from a more detailed turn sequence and a more comprehensive example of play. After a couple of play-throughs and some web searches to clarify a few secondary rules points, we've had no problem and certainly no issues that detracted from enjoying the game.I've purchased both Cormyr and Lloth and am so happy with them that I've pre-ordered the next batch. So far, I'm very satisfied with these games and am looking forward to more and more.

Tresca ""Talien""","[13, 13]","Continuing Wizards of the Coast's trend of repurposing their blind, random miniatures sets for the tabletop version of Dungeons & Dragons to the board gamer set, Dungeon Command: Heart of Cormyr hopes to be a triple threat of interest to D&D; players, adventure system board gamers, and miniature gamers.Instead of being released in random packs, you know exactly what you get with Dungeon Command.  For traditional tabletop players there's a war wizard, a human ranger, a half-orc thug, a Halfling sneak, two elf archers, a dwarf cleric, two dwarven defenders, a dragon knight, an earth guardian, and a copper dragon.  This collection is pretty much the ""player racers of D&D;"" set, with the exception of the oft-forgotten gnome.  I'm not too familiar with Cormyr but as a set it doesn't seem to hang together as well asSting of Lolth- I would have preferred some sort of golem to an earth guardian, and there seems to be an overabundance of dwarves. But the copper dragon is a nice addition.For adventure system players there are 12 monster cards (aligning with each of the miniatures) and four interlocking terrain cards.Like the other sets, the skirmish game is adjudicated through movement and cards, not dice.  This will likely be quite a shock to those who are accustomed to the D&D; adventure system or tabletop role-playing game...in fact I think they're probably still screaming from the revelation in myother review.Dungeon Command features a variety of fun components and rules: treasure chests, dangerous terrain, etc. that make each skirmish different and interesting.  Because it interlocks with other terrain from other sets, the battlefield can be manipulated in a variety of ways - including flipping the tiles over.I've compared Dungeon Command to an unholy union between Magic: The Gathering (you can tap cards) and Dungeons & Dragons Miniatures (you figure it out), but that's oversimplifying the game.  Damage is inflicted simply by moving to a character and attacking, which means that you're basically just running around the board most of the time.  The real strategy comes into play by using the Command cards, which add or reduce damage at the moment you attack.  It's at this point traditional gamers will probably miss their dice.What this means is that, of the three uses for Dungeon Command, miniature gaming is actually the weakest.  It's not bad, but it's not nearly as compelling as the adventure system.  The challenge then is that the warband makeup matters more, and a vanilla tour of the races of D&D; doesn't really cut it for the other two game formats.It's unlikely DMs will plunk down the thirty bucks for this set because they need the miniatures in it.  Drow warband?  Heck yes.  Random PCs with a suspicious race bias towards dwarves?  Not so much.",4.0,Dwarf bias,1344643200,"08 11, 2012",Toys_and_Games,1.0

We have already been talking about including traps and special loot items on the board and possibly writing in scenarios for wandering monsters and random encounters.  It can easily be merged with the adventure game systems that Wizards of the Coast has released.  The best thing about it: you can make it as simple or as complicated as you want.Quality/Components: The faction pack contains miniatures from previous D&D; miniature releases (with the exception of the newest Blood of Gruumsh pack, which has all new miniatures).  They are pre-painted and very handsomely detailed.  The miniatures are excellent quality and very attractive.You will also receive two ""large"" dungeon tiles and two ""small"" dungeon tiles, one of which will contain your starting zone.  All of the tiles are double-sided, displaying outdoor terrain on one side and an indoor dungeon floor on the opposite side.  They can be arranged in a couple of different ways for variations and/or strategy purposes.  Our dungeon tiles were a bit warped and won't lie flat when we put them out on the table to create a game board (see pictures).  This has been pretty annoying so far and we are trying to find a way to ""flatten"" them back out.You will also receive game cards for the adventure system, allowing you to integrate your creatures into the other current Wizards of the Coast Dungeons and Dragons games. Since I already own theLegend of Drizztgame, this was a nice bonus for me.Overall: Dungeon Command should appeal to anyone who enjoys or more of the following:- Trading Card Games (Pokemon, Magic, WoW TCG, etc...)- Dungeons and Dragons Tabletop RPG (or Pathfinder)- Strategy Games (Analog or Digital)- Hero Cliks and other similar miniature-based gamesThis is a great game for fantasy gurus and people who like the idea of trading card games like Magic, but love having a board with pieces to move. If you happen to be a fan of D&D; and the lore of the realms, then this is a must-play game for you. A+",5.0,Awesome D&D strategy game,1362960000,"03 11, 2013",Toys_and_Games,1.0

For the most fun and balanced battles, you should have a minimum of two of the Dungeon Command packs.  Don't buy two of the same pack though, because half of the fun is making the most of your army with all of their different skills and special attacks.  The game is easy to setup.  This game is more about proper usage of cards than it is about lucky dice rolls.  That is a good thing.  The cards are beautiful and the prepainted miniatures are fantastic.  Fans of Wrath of Ashardalon, Legend of Drizzt, and Castle Ravenloft will recognize a few of the miniatures, as some of the molds have been &#34;recycled&#34; for this game.  My family has Lolth, Undeath, and Gruumsh, but usually only play one-on-one battles.  You can play up to four players, but you would need four, preferably different, Dungeon Command Packs.  As a bonus, the packs contain cards for each miniature, so that they can be used as monsters in Wrath of Ashardalon, Legend of Drizzt, or Castle Ravenloft.  I really appreciated that extra option for using the miniatures.The Gruumsh command pack is Orc themed and includes the deadly ogre.  I always hate facing this beast on the battlefield, because he is extremely lethal when combined with Vorpal Blade card.  YIKES!  My son owns this pack and battle my undead warriors.  It's always a good match!  As long as I can do enough damage to the Ogre before my Dracolith is killed, I usually prevail.  However, if his Ogre sticks around too long, the undead tend to go to their second graves!The price on Amazon is fantastic.

We now have all of the faction packs including this release, which is the newest.  It is definitely noteworthy that ALL of the miniatures included in this pack are completely NEW, not re-releases from the old D&D; 3.5-era miniatures booster packs.  The previous Dungeon Command faction packs (Cormyr, Lolth, Goblins and Undead) all featured old miniatures, although many of those creatures have new color schemes.  To some tabletop RPG enthusiasts, the miniatures alone will be well worth buying this pack.  They are EXTREMELY well designed models with VERY nice paint.  We spent about 10 minutes marveling at the figures before we even thought about checking out their matching game cards.Dungeon Command Veterans: The creatures/order cards from this pack add lots of fun new elements to gameplay and strategy and match well with any of the other faction packs.  In our first game, we pitted the Orcs of this set versus the Undead.  There seemed to be a very nice balance between the power of both factions, playing them right out of the box without customizing warbands.  Now that we have all of the faction packs, I think we'll probably start doing some customization.If you are new to the Dungeon Command game, this is a very fun strategy board game / Trading card game hybrid where you essentially battle your army versus your opponents creatures until one warband proves victorious.  You draw cards in to your hand during your turn to bolster your creatures basic attacks/abilities.  The game takes about 2-3 minutes to set up, once you know how to play and a match can run anywhere from 30 minutes to 3 hours depending on how serious you get (kind of like chess.)  One of the best things about Dungeon Command is that you can easily put it away/set it back up if you need to take a break in the middle of a game.  My boyfriend and I usually play an entire match in two sittings during the weekdays.  If you are in to the D&D; world and/or role-playing, you can definitely add as much RP and dialogue as you'd like.  If RPing isn't your thing, don't worry-- there's no dice rolling or paper and pencil requirement for Dungeon  Command, just lay out the board, draw your hand and you're ready to play!",5.0,Another great Dungeon Command set!,1363737600,"03 20, 2013",Toys_and_Games,1.0

And you can play your combination of creatures and order cards against your friend's warband.  You can even play this game with unlimited players, however, I think that six is as high as you should consider going since you are not going to want to wait through everyone else's turn (as the turns are long and slow).There are better games than this, but this is very well designed and very unique.  Also, every few months a new faction pack of dungeon command is being released and the ability of a player to design a custom warband increases with each release.

If you're new to Dungeon Command, Tyranny of Goblins would make a good pack with which to get started. If you've been playing Dungeon Command for a while and want to expand your options--or you play the Adventure System games and want some new creatures to add variety--Tyranny of Goblins does that for you, too. If you're running D&D; as a role-playing game and you need to add some goblinoids to your miniatures collection, Tyranny of Goblins fits the bill. If you're involved with D&D; in any way, there's hardly a downside to Tyranny of Goblins.As a faction for Dungeon Command, the goblins play quite well; as I mentioned before, they're a good faction for beginners. They're as tough or tougher than the other factions, and although they are heavy on melee combat, they have some good ranged combatants as well. The order cards offer a well-rounded set of options. The goblins' big backup monsters--a feral troll and a horned devil--can be hard to beat. The troll starts with 120 hp and regenerates, never mind damage-reduction orders--so your opponent will need to give it a lot of attention once it comes out.As a source of miniatures for D&D; role-playing, the usefulness of Tyranny of Goblins really depends on what you already have in your collection. In some ways, this is the best pack for those purposes, however, since the original of the horned devil whose reprint appears in Tyranny of Goblins goes for $40 and up on the secondary market all by itself! All three of your major goblinoid species--goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears--are represented in the pack, along with that feral troll I mentioned earlier. In case you're wondering about skin tones, the goblins are green, hobgoblins are orange, and bugbears are gray.All in all, I highly recommend this pack for just about anybody who enjoys Dungeon Command, who wants to experiment with Dungeon Command, or who DMs D&D; and doesn't already have a horned devil mini or simply wants more goblins.",5.0,"Great for skirmishing, great for role-playing",1358985600,"01 24, 2013",Toys_and_Games,1.0

Given the blueprint for this refreshing skirmish game system, each pack is ready to go right out of the gate.  No need to track down an earlier released Base Game. Each faction pack has everything you need to play, including 12 handsomely pre-painted minis, great looking cards and tokens to take on your buddy with his own faction pack.  In other words it is just like a real skirmish. Each player brings his homies and it's game on.  I like this idea; it keeps the game's ontogeny vital and fresh as new factions are released.Interestingly, I spoke with a friend in Germany just the other night, asking him about the seminal D&D; miniature skirmish game that Dungeon Command evolved from.  He said they didn't play it anymore, that his friends had picked up the DC system and were quite engaged with it.  There are several likely reasons for that.  While DC retains the cool minis, it takes the skirmish and gives it an easy to grasp depth and nuance.  Not only do you push around some lovely plastic but it brings storm clouds of strategic and tactical brainstorming, which is what gamers are really after.  Games are quick, engaging, and ultimately satisfying, providing the feeling that whether you won or lost, there is a game system here that you can sink your front teeth into.Order cards introduce a variety of options and counter options for players and their minions.  Deployment creates an ebb and flow of battle as each commander's strength of command determines the number of creatures deployed.  And what I like, it doesn't always have to be one on one; creatures can assist each other with a particular attack when they band together.  Morale is key to victory and cowering can play an important part.  It's not just a game of knock out blows but an experience reflecting the realism of courage and fear, resolve and dissolution among combatants.Fanboys of Dungeon Command come from all disciplines: RPG, mini play, dungeon crawlers, even a few boardgamers, proper.  Frankly, other than the added depth of realism, what jigs me most is the potential of nearly 1500 original sculpted minis of the DDM line lurking nearby!  How cool would it be to give a second coming to them?  Players have already begun modding their faves and making home brew stats.WoC will have released five factions pack in a short period of time, hoping the game will catch on quickly.  In a smart marketing move, WoC included cards in each Dungeon Command Faction Pack for use with WoC's popular Adventure System Board Games like Legend of Drizz't, Wrath of Ashardalon and Castle Ravenloft.

I was happy to see that it was remade and still in circulation. As others have noted, it is fairly simple as far as gameplay goes. Much of the in-game mechanics involves simple dice rolls to determine the winner in fights with various monsters and possible damage to you if the monster wins. The loot system and victory mechanics are simple but fun. Therefore, it is an easy way to introduce young kids to fun fantasy board gaming. One thing that must be underscored, however is that it is very easy to customize. After getting familiar with the game, it is very easy and fun to invent new classes of characters. I invented ones based on my kid's favorite adventure characters (Merida from Brave, the kids from the Narnia books, the Hobbit books, etc.), and each had special in-game abilities (e.g., Bilbo could use his ring to automatically escape from an encounter, and Gandalf could use his forsight to detect the nature of an enemy in a room before the encounter). I won't get into the details here. If anybody is interested, I can just post my notes in a further comment discussion. But this sort of thing adds tons of replay-ability to the game.

In the era before computer games (which make this sort of game a lot easier), my brother and I used to play games of &#34;clean-out,&#34; where we'd ignore the target amount of treasure we were supposed to earn and instead would clear out the entire dungeon and compare totals at the end.So when I saw this new version being released, I picked up a copy for my family and his. I'm very pleased with the result: The board is now on board game stock and the teeny tiny cards are replaced with larger ones, and aren't required to be placed all over the board ahead of time. (Tokens are now used to denote which rooms have been cleared, which is a sensible improvement.) The basic rules are actually printed on the board, which is a good thing, since the actual instructions are a little unclear about some rules and aren't organized terribly well.The little generic plastic tokens have been replaced with cardboard standees, two for each character class, one male and one female. The classes have changed since 1979 -- elves, heroes, superheroes and wizards have been replaced with their functional equivalents of halflings, clerics, fighters and wizards -- and some of the monsters have been replaced. All of the art has: The very old school D&D; art of the original has been replaced with what looks like art culled from the third and fourth editions of Dungeons & Dragons, which is either a feature or a bug, depending on your tastes.But the total package is put together better than the original, the map, while technically identical, has been redrawn with better and clearer art and adding the rules to the board makes play go a lot faster. I'm thrilled with this new edition and curious about what this summer's refresh of the game (in time for the release of the fifth edition of Dungeons & Dragons, which this serves as a gateway drug for) will do to it.For regular use, I'd recommend getting some Reaper Bones miniatures instead of using the unsatisfying cardboard standees -- compare those with the plastic miniatures inside a game of Talisman, for instance, and you can see which will be more fun for kids -- and maybe some cooler dice from Chessex.But this is a great relatively quick family board game. We play it regularly with our six-year-old, who's the master of swooping in on treasures dropped by wounded family members in battle. (And, perhaps wisely, this edition doesn't include rules for players fighting each other, just monsters.)Definitely recommended for fans of the original and those looking for a way to introduce younger family members to the world of Dungeons & Dragons.",5.0,Better than the original,1390953600,"01 29, 2014",Toys_and_Games,1.0

Here's the short summary: it uses cards instead of dice to resolve combat, it's compatible with both the D&D; Adventure System series of board games (including The Legend of Drizzt) and tabletop Dungeons & Dragons, and it comes with a series of prepainted plastic miniatures recycled from the cancelled Dungeons & Dragons Miniatures game. I'm less interested in this latest iteration of the miniatures game as I am in its compatibility with other D&D; games.The title should give away what you can expect to find here: goblins. Or rather, goblinoids and the creatures who love them.  The set comes with a goblin archer, two goblin cutters, and a goblin champion.  These three miniatures can be found (unpainted) in The Legend of Drizzt game.  It should be pointed out the tiles that come with the set do not perfectly match the underground tiles of The Legend of Drizzt, so while they are physically compatible they don't merge quite perfectly with the Adventure System sets.With the basics established, the set continues with a wolf and a goblin wolf rider. Apparently Wizards of the Coast has moved away from the term ""worg"" which in turn was drawn from ""warg,"" the evil wolves named by Tolkien as being in league with goblins. But the affiliation still stands, which explains their inclusion here.There are also two hobgoblins soldiers, a bugbear berserker, and a hobgoblin sorcerer. The sorcerer does more than sorcery - he summons a horned devil, which is the only explanation for why this figure is in the set.  The horned devil is one of two large figures along with the feral troll, who will be right at home in The Legend of Drizzt.There are two commanders: Tarkon Draal, Black Hand of Bane who demoralizes opponents and Snig the Axe who deploys goblin hordes and is still just as mysterious as when he appeared in the cancelled miniatures game. As the card says, nobody knows if Snig is the name of the axe or the goblin.This set focuses on what it does best - goblins. Combined with the miniatures from the Drow Dungeon Command set you can replace quite a few of the unpainted miniatures of The Legend of Drizzt with their painted duplicates.  While it may not be fancy, this set makes an excellent goblin warband for Dungeon Command, Adventure System, or the role-playing game.",5.0,Goblinoids and the creatures who love them,1350518400,"10 18, 2012",Toys_and_Games,1.0

They also improved it by placing various helpful charts on the board itself and made things a lot easier and less of an effort to do (such as keeping track of unbeaten creatures).This is basically a game of getting loot and making it out of the Dungeon with enough of it to win the game (before the other players do). Your hero enters a room, fights a monster and if your hero wins you get a treasure. When you have enough treasure to win the game you must head back to the entrance and make it there alive. .This is a great fundamental introductory to Dungeons & Dragons for kids.It teaches two things.

Customer service responded promptly on Sunday before Veterans' Day!  They said Dungeon! includes 80 loot cards, more than enough for any character to win.In my opinion, there should be enough loot cards for all monster encounters.

I made my own tuck box for the magic cards and a 12 slot tray for the monster & loot cards.When I discovered the lack of loot cards, I tried to make a loot table.  I placed the special items (magic sword, secret door reveals, medallions, and crystal balls) on a roll of 2 or 12.  Of five players, no one acquired a special item.

It was really inexpensive when I bought it, so even if it was a dud, I didn't feel I would worry about it. The board is well-made, although with the irregular tile size, it is sometimes hard to count your movement out. It really doesn't make a huge difference, but it would have been nice to have clear squares to move around on.The cardstock playing pieces are of average quality.  The treasure and monster cards a little small. Again, adequate to play, but nothing you are going to be wowed over.The game mechanics are rather shallow, but I was expecting this ahead of time. It's a very straightforward dungeon delve, hack n slash game. The dice mechanics are 2d6 with each of the four classes having a single hit number to defeat the monster. If you hit the target number the monster is dead and you get its loot. If you miss, it has a chance to attack back with a handful of random effects. The only wrinkle to combat is the wizard, who gets a couple spells and the ability to teleport to different areas of the board.Once you collect your target GP Value of treasure (classes have different goals), it's a race to the exit and first one there wins. It plays in about 30-45 minutes.I had fun playing it the first time, basically for nostalgia.

Very clean add simple for kids to learn and follow after I showed them how to play. Nice game about average play and fun. But cheap cards with nice art work and color.Good game board. Lots of fun with two to four players but can be played 1  to  8 players. Record all the cards so if you lose them then you can replace them with the data recorded if you feel the need.

It's just as fun for two players as it is for more, and it is super-simple to learn. The build quality is mostly good, but the individual player tokens and the cards are a little sub-par. That said, the price is low, and the build quality of the board and the rest of the tokens are great - what you might expect from your average Eurogame. Also, the play (for two players, anyway) is quite quick, so it's easy to play when you don't want to get heavily involved. Our first 2-player game was roughly 30-45 minutes, and we've had games as little as 15-20 minutes.Taking the above at face value, however, the rules could use some more clarity.  There are some situations that are simply missing from the rules, perhaps requiring a little errata.  For example, there is a card called Crystal Ball that allows you to peek into a room in advance to see what monster and treasure are there, at the cost of not moving that turn.  If you're a Wizard, you need to return to the Great Hall occasionally in order to recharge your spells, waiting one turn without moving each time.  Technically, you could ""not move or attack"" by recharging your spells, thus also peeking into a room for each spell you recharge.  The rules do not state that this isn't okay, but is this an accidental omission or an intentional decision?  This means that the Wizard could spend a few turns wandering around and attacking, then teleport back to the Great Hall and sit there recharging spells while also plotting and planning their next few moves, knowing exactly which rooms to go and attack, clear them out, then teleport back to the Great Hall and repeat.  One might argue that this also means that you are giving other players time to catch up... but that's already present in the Wizard's normal recharge process, so that doesn't change.Another rule requiring a little clarity is the Teleport spell for Wizards.  (It seems that most of the confusion is around Wizards, doesn't it?)  Teleport states that you can move instantly from one chamber (that's ""chamber"", not ""room"", and this matters) to another chamber instantly... so long as the destination chamber is in the same Level or on a Level next to the current chamber.  However, the Great Hall is a chamber that is technically next to Level 6.  It seems a little too easy to simply pop back and forth between the Great Hall and Level 6... but the rules seem to indicate that this is okay.One other rule (again about Wizards!) is that you can seemingly stand just outside a room, fire a spell into that room, and risk nothing because the monster won't chase you or leave the room.  This mechanic seems very unbelievable (setting aside the fantasy aspect of the game, of course), as any sentient creature that can see someone shooting a fireball at it is going to want to do something about it.  (Especially, say, an Evil Wizard?)  But no, the rules say you are somehow safe by standing outside the room, so plink away, cowardly Wizard!To sum up, it's a fun game, great for young or old, new players of fantasy boardgames or seasoned players looking for a little mindless hack'n slash, and is decent build quality.  The rules are generally easy to follow, but could use a little clarity here and there, costing this review one star.  I'll change the rating to five stars if Wizards of the Coast publishes some errata to update these points.One thing Wizards has also done is release some variant rules that add value to the game, such as the ability to roll dice instead of just moving 5 spaces each turn (which can become tedious) or a cooperative play option.

I was surprised at how easy it was to pick up and start playing.The object of the game is simple: the players take the role of a character and go into a dungeon to kill monsters to get loot. Whoever gets sufficient loot (this depends on the character, with more powerful characters needing more loot) and makes it out of the dungeon first, wins the game.Combat is very straightforward. The non-wizard characters are all basically the game, merely determining what number the character needs to roll to kill a monster. If the roll fails, the monster strikes back, possibly missing, dealing wounds (forcing a treasure drop), or even killing the player making them start from the beginning of the game.Every fight has a very small chance of the player getting killed, sending the character from the game and having all his/her loot claimed by the monster. The player can start over with a new character on their next turn (and will probably make a beeline for where his old character died, hopefully reclaiming the loot before another player grabs it).Overall for the price, and for the nostalgic factor for those who played the original back when it released in 1975, this is a great buy for any tabletop, rpg gamer, or those just getting into the genre.",5.0,Review,1400112000,"05 15, 2014",Toys_and_Games,1.0

If your family does not include any children under 10 or so you may want to try another game. The rules are overly simplistic and the gameplay depends entirely on the dice - there is very little strategy. The outcomes of each round vary wildly (including a 1-in-12 chance on *every* monster attack that you will lose all of your treasure and have to start over from the very beginning) and there are very few ways to influence the game through skill or strategy.I purchased this taking a chance that it might be a fun addition to a game night among adults but unfortunately it is not.Also, the game itself is frustrating because there are numerous cards you must keep separated: 6 stacks of treasure cards, 6 stacks of monster cards, and 3 stacks of spell cards. All of these cards are smaller than business cards and even more flimsy. There are not enough of each type to shuffle properly, but you have to mix them before each game - that is 15 stacks of tiny, thin cards you need to mix up with your big clunky adult-sized human hands every game. It quickly becomes annoying.As another reviewer mentioned, the usage of the ""Cleared"" tokens is also frustrating. The rooms on the board are quite small and each one requires a token once cleared; a slight bump and they all scatter out of place. In addition, if you roll the dice on the board, you risk knocking over one of many tokens or stand-ups that might be carefully positioned.Clearly this game was designed with kids in mind, which is great, but it's unfortunate that so many online reviews seem to say it's fun for adults.

It served as a great recruiting tool for my elementary school friends to get them into playing Dungeons & Dragons later. Over thirty years later, I played this latest iteration with my five-year-old son.The premise of Dungeon! is the original premise of Dungeons & Dragons: four murder hobos wander into a dungeon, grab as much treasure as they can by killing as many monsters as they can, and then escape back home with it all. The dungeon has a neat order to it, with increasingly difficult levels of monsters (six in total) and correspondingly higher treasure rewards. Some treasure includes magic swords that give a bonus to attack while others allow the player to see what monster lurks in the nearby room.Combat with each monster can lead to acquiring a treasure or, if you are unable to beat a target number with a combined roll of two dice, losing treasure, ground, or even your character's life. But don't worry, like in the tabletop role-playing game, even death isn't permanent.The original Dungeon! game had four classes: elf, hero, superhero, and wizard corresponding to the original Chainmail wargame.  Yes kids, back then we had heroes and superheroes as classes.  The 1980s version I'm more familiar with was retooled to match Basic Dungeons & Dragons: dwarf, elf, paladin, thief, warrior, and wizard. So perhaps it's no surprise that this latest version has cleric, fighter, rogue, and wizard classes.The wizard, a constant through all editions, differs significantly from the rest of the classes in his ability to cast spells: fireball, lightning bolt, and teleport. And that's part of Dungeon!'s brilliance.  You can play correspondingly different levels of play by the character you choose.  My son played the Halfling rogue and I played the human fighter. Because each class has different levels of gold requirements to win the game, each class is encouraged to take more or less risk by venturing into deeper levels of the dungeon.One consistent problem with all versions of Dungeon! is its multitude of pieces.  There's cards for monsters, treasure and spells, cardboard pieces for the classes that don't stand up particularly well, magic sword tokens, lose a turn tokens, and number tokens that I still have no idea what they do. But the most egregious tokens are the ""cleared"" graveyard markers.  When monsters are killed the markers are placed in the room, which is fine, until you have 20+ and if you jostle the board the tokens slide all over the board.  It's very easy to lose track of what rooms you cleared as a result.The other problem is that occasionally you're supposed to draw cards randomly from your collection of treasure, but they are clearly marked on one side by level and color.

You basically pick a character ranging from a fighter, rogue, mage & cleric, each class has an amount of gold needed to win the game, so the rogue needs 10,000 gold but is fairly weak so it would be hard for him to fight higher level monsters which drop better gold, unlike the mage who needs 30,000 gold to win the game but it better at fighting higher level monsters. You move around the board going into rooms beating the monster to gain gold until you meet the gold requirement then you can leave the dungeon to win. This is a very simple and straight forward game.

The artwork is fantastic and the quad fold board is quite large (although not as large as the 80s version). Retains all the gameplay of the original but with new characters and monsters. They dropped the 80s reissue mechanics of wounds and healing, and ambushing other characters.Now for the components. The board as mentioned is very high quality with great artwork. It isn't large enough to put the monster cards in the rooms so there are these little tokens you have to use to keep track of what monsters/treasures are where. This works pretty well although slows gameplay down somewhat and you only get 12 markers which may not be enough, although I haven't played enough to run out yet. Alot of the most important gameplay tables and information is printed right on the board so you don't have to constantly refer to the rule sheet which is a nice touch.The monster treasure cards are very nice although a bit on the thin side. But they're no thinner than the cards on the 70s and 80s versions of the game. For the price, you can't really expect thick card stock.The various tokens though are heavy thick stock and double sided so you don't have to fiddle with flipping them right side up. The character tokens are two piece interlock and are serve their purpose but I'm a bit worried that overtime they will loosen and not stay together. The included six sided dice are standard fair. The rule book isn't really a book. It's a cleverly folded single sheet of paper printed on both sides but it can be read without unfolding it like a roadmap.All in all a great buy for those that grew up with the originals and also a great way to introduce younger kids to the classic dungeon crawl experience.",5.0,Worthy successor to the old original,1370044800,"06 1, 2013",Toys_and_Games,1.0

Gameplay summary: take turns moving your hero around the board exploring rooms; each room has one random monster of a certain difficulty level; if you kill the monster, you get treasure; accumulate a certain amount of treasure and return to the center of the board.  There are four hero types to choose from, each has certain strengths and weaknesses; some are better against higher level monsters, others can get around the board easier.  Higher level monsters provide more treasure, but the heroes capable of defeating the higher level monsters need more treasure to win.It takes about 30-60 minutes to play.The game components are almost entirely cardboard... sturdy enough, but I felt like the heroes would have been better as wood/plastic.

The goal of the game follows traditional ""dungeon crawler"" gameplay where you explore the rooms of an underground dungeon to encounter monsters, fight them, gain experience and loot treasure. In this Dungeon game, player characters do not gain experience and level up since the game plays too quickly for that.(A ""house rule"" that we've adopted is to actually roll basic character sheets and give them 1 XP per monster level that they kill, and give minor bonuses as they level up. This is purely for fun and does not affect the gameplay of the board game.)The first player to reach their gold goal and make it back to the start wins. Typical game with 3-4 players lasts 45 minutes, but up to 8 can play. It would be extremely hard to win with 8 since the rooms would get cleared so quickly but I have yet to try it with that many players.There are 4 character classes--Fighter, Cleric, Rogue, and Wizard. Each class has unique abilities and combat rolls. Most notable among the four is the Wizard class, which can attack at range and remain undamaged. This unfair advantage is balanced by the fact that Wizards run out of spells and have to return to the starting space to recharge their spell book (which will take at least 7 turns). So, a Wizard who rolls extremely good rolls can clean out Level 6 rooms quickly for the win, while poor rolls will effectively put the Wizard out of play for up to a dozen turns while they recharge. It's a pretty good balance. And due to the Wizard's firepower, they have a much higher gold threshold to win (30,000) which further balances this powerful class. Other players will want to clear low-level rooms quickly to earn their 10,000G first.The Dungeon board appears at first glance to be one large level full of rooms and larger chambers, but it is supposed to represent 6 levels of depth with each level progressively more difficult (but with greater treasure). There are hidden doors in many of the passages that require a turn (or more) to open, which helps slow down the gameplay.Combat involves rolling two D6 dice against a monster's threshold defense value. The lower level monsters are an easy kill with a defense of 2-4, while level 6 monsters tend toward the 10-12 range (so, realistically, only a Wizard has a chance of defeating a Worm or Dragon at range without getting killed--and thus, each character class has a recommended range of levels, beyond which they are ineffective).Bonuses are limited to just a magic sword which will add +1 or +2 to the player's roll (Fighter, Cleric, and Rogue only). I would have liked to see more bonus cards in the deck. This game really appeals to the player who enjoys playing with house rules. Indeed, this game seems to encourage house rules to customize the gameplay. It is purposely simplistic and as such, the rule book is only 8 pages with illustrations. I imagine a lot of fans will create their own enhanced cards. Which seems to be an opportunity for Wizards of the Coast! Official expansion card decks would be a welcome addition to this product.Now I can't sing it's praises without at least pointing out some of the flaws. Although the gameplay is almost perfect out of the box there is room for improvement. First, my biggest complaint is the playing cards which are only 1/2 size. I don't like half-sized cards in any game (for instance, Cave Troll, for the same reason). I can't imagine that using full size cards would have added much to the production costs. The small cards limit this game quite a bit, however, it may be that WotC decided to use them because the table can get crowded with 2 stacks per level (12 card stacks--monsters and treasure cards for each level).Another house variant we have considered doing is mixing the monster cards from all levels, and similarly for treasure cards. This would render the game board into a single large flat level with truly random encounters in the rooms, which could add to the anxiety. Frankly, when you know what's going to be in a level 1 room, there's little fear of danger. But what if there's a L6 dragon inside?",5.0,Extremely fun with lots of replay value,1375660800,"08 5, 2013",Toys_and_Games,1.0

You get two expansions in one: Undermountain and Skullport. Both feature 3 new Lord cards, 3 new basic building locations (each on a separate small game board), a ton of new buyable buildings, plus a huge amount of new quest and intrigue cards. Skullport includes a Corruption mechanic that penalizes your end-game points by the number of Corruption tokens (blue skulls) you have vs. how many remain on the included Corruption Track (also on a small game board). You gain Corruption by using the awesome new buildings or completing some of the crazy new quests. Corruption is easy to gain but hard to get rid of (ask any politician, lol), but the game includes a number of ways to get rid of it a bit at a time (such as through using certain buildings, completing certain quests, or playing certain intrigue cards). Corruption management is vital. Don't worry about it early, but be sure to start cutting back by mid-game and reversing the number whenever possible.This expansion also includes a 6th player faction, The Gray Hands, and an extra agent meeple for each color with optional rules to play a long game where everyone starts with an extra agent (you must use the long game rules when playing with 6 people). There are also caravan tokens which stand in for large numbers of adventurer cubes in case the supply runs short. In a 3-player game, this only happened once, but I can see it being necessary with 4-6 players because you will gain a lot more adventurer cubes a lot faster using either or both expansions.Tried playing a 3p long game with both expansions, and it tripled the game time to almost four hours, but it (mostly) flew by. Part of the length was because we were learning the new rules and freaking out over the expansion's super-powered new stuff, partly chatting, and one of the players suffers from ""analysis paralysis"" big time, with the other two having milder cases. Pretty sure the game would have only doubled in length if we were less chatty and more familiar with the expansions.Some of the new stuff seems like it might be underpowered or overpowered (and we don't like half the new Lords, including Xanathar who makes your Corruption penalty less, or Halaster Blackcloak and Sangalor who only score by buying their expansion's buildings and completing its quests, which get diluted when using both expansions). Compare those lords to the one who lets you score 6 pts. from any 1 quest type of your choice, or 5 for each 10+ pt. quest you complete). There are several ways to play 2-3 or even more intrigue cards per turn, and that really slows the game down and feels unfair and overpowered to the rest of the players. That said, both my opponents in the 3 player game I mentioned had the ability to play multiple intrigue cards per turn and I still beat them by hardly playing any intrigue cards. I focused on Corruption management, going from a high of 7 to only 1 at the end, which was only worth -4 pts. to me (instead of -28 pts), and solving as many double digit pt. Piety quests as I could (including a 40 pt. one) to get my Lord bonus of 6 pts. for any 1 quest type of my choice.If you combine both Undermountain and Skullport in the same game, you have to remove 12 buildings, 30 quests, and 25 intrigue cards from the base game to accommodate all the expansion stuff. That'd be fine--once--but the rules want you to do it every time you play by randomizing which base set bits are removed. I'm not sure I can imagine only playing with one set after trying both, so maybe the best solution in this case is just to yank all the crappiest stuff out of the base set once and never use them again. Also, when the game is prepped for using both sets next time, neither the new storage tray or base set hold the combined buildings and cards properly, resulting in unsightly sprawl with loose cards floating around and a bunch of buildings having to be split between both boxes--which sucks.Nitpicks aside, I do love this expansion, and you get a TON of stuff to freshen up the game that will keep you going for months. It's a great value and a lot of fun. It's so big and crazy, I'm not sure what the designers can do for the next expansion, but I'm looking forward to finding out!UPDATE #1: Decided after another game using both expansions at the same time that it's just too swingy, too super-crazy, and unpredictable. And the Xanathar lord is broken and guaranteed to make you lose the game, so I've thrown that card out until it gets an official fix. Tried a game using only Undermountain, and that played much more like the regular game, only reasonably souped-up. Game time was increased to about 2 hours, nothing crazy like the 4 hours using both expansions. And I completed four 40 point quests! Will try using only the Skullport expansion next and update my review if necessary, but for right now, I'm advocating you restrain yourself from trying the mega-game and just do Undermountain first, then Skullport, then maybe try to combine them once just to see what that's like. But I think the expansions were not really meant or balanced to be used together.UPDATE #2: After playing just the Skullport expansion, I have to say I'm not that fond of it or its Corruption mechanic. Undermountain is way more fun. Not that Skullport doesn't have good stuff, just that a lot of it is overshadowed by Corruption. I've decided to just streamline the base game and the expansions and weed out all the inferior or overpowered stuff (including anything that gives or removes Corruption), mixing just the cards and buildings that are the most fun. Some of these cards and buildings never get bought or played, so what's the point of bothering with them at all? Still others are possibly broken and OP, like the Yawning Portal (4 gold cost building that gives the user 2 cubes of their choice and the owner one and basically hands them the game if they get it early enough), or the Undermountain building (name escapes me) that lets you play three Intrigue cards. And all the new cards that let you steal people's buildings are unfair and create more hard feelings than fun. That still leaves a ton of good stuff to choose from. I'm knocking my rating down to four stars after having played with this set for about a month. It's not balanced well enough, and I hate that expansion games can take so much longer to play. The game isn't deep enough to support more than 60-90 minutes of play time.",4.0,Updated Review: Waterdeep on steroids!,1377129600,"08 22, 2013",Toys_and_Games,1.0

The game requires you to mix cards from the expansion with the base game. But the new cards are of an ever-so-slightly different size and can make shuffling feel awkward. They're also printed upside down, which isn't a huge deal during the game, but when all is done, you then need to separate out the expansion again. Each expansion card has a tiny little icon that is hard enough to notice as it is, but combine that with a deck where the cards are facing every which way because the upside-down expansion cards make it impossible to maintain any sort of order, and separating the cards gets really annoying. The types of quests are also sometimes different colors than in the base game. If they're following the same design as the original, the cards should have been the easiest things to get right, but they completely botched them. But I'd say still worth your time because it is a good game. I just will dock a star for the stupid cards.",3.0,What's with the cards?,1387065600,"12 15, 2013",Toys_and_Games,0.0

Both expansions included (Undermountain and Skullport) add quite a bit of new material to the game, namely new quests, intrigue cards, building cards, and the Corruption mechanic.  The new Lords, however, are pretty hit or miss to me, with most being boring and one being quite broken.  The ability to play either a long or traditional game adds a lot of depth as well, and the ability to integrate a 6th player is most welcome.The new rules inset does a good job explaining how to integrate one or both of the included expansions, and also includes a pretty detailed errata which answers most questions that naturally come up during the course of the game.I really wanted to emphasise how awesome Corruption truly is in this expansion.  It makes you feel dirty and well, corrupt, to pursue such unrestrained power in the context of the game.  It seemed that each game I played with the Skullport expansion was a sheer rush for all players to obtain as much Corruption (and other resources, too, of course) in the early game, and the later portions of the game everyone was definitely managing their corruption and trying to get rid of it (if possible).This expansion is definitely enjoyable and it's difficult to even think of playing the base game without the expansion now.

It essentially adds two possible new game modes. One simply expands upon the base game, adding more challenging but more rewarding quests, new lord cards, and new buildings.

It's good enough to play /w 2 people or 5 people.This expansion (which is really two expansions) makes EVERYTHING BETTER.You get Skullport (new resource in the form of corruption/-points) and Undermountain (more intrigue, bigger quests) and new lords, intrigue, and buildings appropriate to the new mechanics. You also get a new color to add a new player.We've primarily played Undermountain and it makes the game MUCH more forgiving when there's more players b/c it's harder to 'lock' a single player out of a key resource. My wife and mother in law don't like the idea of corruption (mom's a little religious/goody goody) so we haven't played it much, but based on reading through the buildings, cards, etc., it adds a lot more volatility to determining who wins in the end.There's extra agents to play a 'long game' variant, which is nice (broke 200 points once o.O).Some folks have mentioned issues with the first run (which I think i have). The quest cards are printed 'upside down' compared to the base game. Makes it easier to sort for us afterwards b/c we just sort based on orientation of the back of the card. There are icons on everything so you can easily see which expansion it belongs to.There's a game mode that lets you play with both expansions, but then you remove cards and buildings from the original expansion, which can give you a lot of different synergies/combos compared to just playing with one expansion.There are some really cool synergies/combos around certain quests, intrigue cards, and buildings. For example, mom completed a quest that allowed her to draw an intrigue card after she plays one and then there's another building that allows you to play multiple intrigue cards (I think 3) and another quest? I think that gives you victory points for intrigue cards. She literally couldn't use all the intrigue cards she accumulated, but it was pretty fun and cool since we had to change our strategy to try to prevent her from playing intrigue cards.Finally, there's a intrigue card that allows you to 'steal' resources from an opponent, but then that player gets the intrigue card (so they can 'attack' you back later). The flavor text is: Cue Evil Laugh. So we made mom do an evil laugh everytime she used it, which is hilarious in and of itself.",5.0,Oh so absolutely worth it,1390953600,"01 29, 2014",Toys_and_Games,1.0

This penny was released earlier this month.After having a bad experience with Whitman's folder for the Westward Journey nickels of a few years ago, I opted for this holder. So far it has done a good job holding each penny with holes for each describing each design. A fifth hole at the top is for the obverse (""heads"" side) of the penny. The holder is also very sturdy as well. The design features a montage of photos that shows the statue of Lincoln from the Memorial, an image of a medal with Lincoln, the US flag, and a painting of Lincoln. On the bottom is a quote from Lincoln's second Inaugural Address. Overall I'm impressed with the design.For someone who doesn't want to collect the entire Lincoln series and just wants these four pennies, this is a great little holder. I fully recommend it!",5.0,A great way to store the series!,1259452800,"11 29, 2009",Toys_and_Games,1.0

The authors have obviously gone to some lengths to make sure the ""fit"" is Laundry and not Generic Horror RPG With Laundry Wrapping Paper. I haven't run any of them yet.The real value of this book, in my opinion, is that it will allow a GM from somewhere other than the UK to properly get traction on how to present The Laundry RPG, to show how it is a fundamentally different beast to, say, Delta Green or any other government-fights-modern-horror RPG.The Laundry stories (The Atrocity Archives,The Fuller Memorandum (A Laundry Files Novel),The Jennifer Morgue) are, of course, the first resource, but don't always convey to the foreign reader the feel of what's going on. I could list a whole roll of media research materials such as ""Yes Minister"" and ""House of Cards"" but Black Bag Jobs does much of the work itself and for that alone I give it many stars.The book is a perfect bound paperback with a color cover.

Specifically, you need a 12 sided die (Called a D12 by the cognoscenti) and up to six regular six sided dice (D6). The game comes with one set, but you will likely need more.That's what you get in this boxed set: One D12 Feat Die, six D6, all in a black/dark gray on off-white color scheme. I asked about different colors when I bought my set and was told that there are no alternatives to this one. Oh well.Why can't you use ""ordinary"" dice of that type? You can. You'll need a crib sheet to make the D12 into a proper ""Feat Die"" but other than that you are good to go.Why bother with these expensive dice then? Well, the D12 Feat Die is properly marked up with opposed faces for the Eye and Gandalf runes for one. That matters to some people. If you use some D12 you have lying around you'll be using the ""11"" and ""12"" faces for those special results and they aren't going to be on opposed faces of the die. Big furry deal, right? But of course, everyone had better be using the *same* faces for those runes if there isn't going to be an almighty real-world fight at some point. The real die avoids this issue.Also, the D6s are marked up so you can quickly tell the ""1"",""2"" and ""3"" faces from the ""4"",""5"" and ""6"" faces which makes evaluating successes very quick indeed. Not only that, the ""6"" face has a special meaning sometimes and it is elaborated upon with even more detail making for unambiguous and easy recognition of that event, should it occur.None of these are show-stoppers for using non-specialized dice, but consider: if you introduce a lot of new players to a One Ring game, how much easier is it to explain the mechanics of the die conventions if you are using this set? A convention GM would consider these money well spent I think. I do.Besides, you should use the right dice for the job or you will annoy and vex the Dice Gods.

Here is a card game that uses cards, Dalek tokens and TARDIS tokens to defend or attack your lands for ownership.The colorful cards each have very a specific meaning and purpose. The defenders who are The Doctor, Amy, Rory, River Song and even Captain Jack fight for keeping land that you lay down as your property. What land? Imagine every place the Doctor has visited since his run as the 9th through the 11th Doctor (Christopher Eccleston, David Tennant, Matt Smith). Lake Silencio, Sardick Town, Silurian City, Bowie Base One, Roman Britain, Luna University and Zarathustra are some of the locations to name a few.Now the Enemies include the Daleks, Nestine Consciousness, Cybermen, Weeping Angels, Sycorax, Sontarans, The Silence, Davros, the Minotaur, the Beast, Gangers, The Master, Prisoner Zero, the Slitheen and more who all try to take your lands. Oh and watch out for the Dreamlord! He's really dangerous!Now add the element of support cards to help you fight, defend and in some cases give you special powers and abilities. They are labeled the TARDIS, Sonic Screwdriver, Fish Fingers and Custard and yes they do help immensely!Cards are dealt out. Then you figure out your lands. Then you place your defenders or attackers and the battle begins. The game is played in turns and what is unique is that you play your hand but you always must have three cards to pass to your player on your right. (Counter-clockwise) The turn continues going to the next person on your left. (Clockwise) In other words you are doing things in two directions. Sounds strange, but it makes for great stagey in playing.Once you achieved a land, you then place your colors TARDIS token on it. If you are attacking or taking over someone else's land that is not yours, you place your colors Dalek token on it. When the first player gets five TARDIS's or five DALEK's out on table in their color, the game is over and everything stops. However, your lands are worth victory points. Some are low and some are high. The victor is the one with highs points from the lands they have acquired.It can be vicious and turn on a dime. You could have four lands in one turn and zero the next. It changes with the player and the cards. It's extremely fun and you find yourself acting out scenes from the various enemies and locations you see in your hand. (If you are familiar with Who, of course.)Its fun for the whole family and you can sit and relax and bring on your `game face' when you are to defend the universe using the Doctor and his companions for help.

After a couple of turns it got pretty exciting.  We discovered that a good strategy is to not play land cards as soon as you get them.  It can make a big difference if you play a bunch of them near the end of the game when everyone is tied up fighting for 1 or 2 point lands and you drop and take over a couple of 7 pointers in the last round.This can be a very cut throat type of game if you play with some aggressive players.  Always get as many players as you can, more players makes a much more interesting game.  Also remember that fates can change at the drop of a hat.  Being achingly close to a victory then having it snatched away by the next player can be frustrating, but then you can do it back to him on your next turn.Overall a very fun and exciting game that takes more than luck to win.",5.0,"Fun game, different paths to victory",1367366400,"05 1, 2013",Toys_and_Games,1.0

Something we can all enjoy and equally get into.  We built a Da Vinci catapult, a siege tower, did some exploring with microscopes, geocaching, etc. with varying degrees of interest in one of the two boys.  Don&#8217;t get me wrong we all had fun, but it was more for one or the other depending on the activity.  My older son, since the day he could, has loved to talk.  He loves to tell stories about things he&#8217;s done, things he&#8217;d like to do, or things he&#8217;s watched.  If he can make a story out of something, he will.  My younger son has, since I can remember, loved to play board games.  There are ones he likes more than others but I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ve played a game he didn&#8217;t like.I recently became aware of a card/board game by a company out of the UK named Cubicle7.  The game is called &#8220;Hobbit Tales: From the Green Dragon Inn&#8221; and it looked very interesting.  Cubicle7 also makes a RPG that takes place in the same world as this game called &#8220;The One Ring.&#8221;  The cards in this game can be used with that RPG if desired, so it&#8217;s all very integrated.  The basic premise of the game is that the players are hobbits sitting around a table at the Green Dragon Inn telling stories of their adventures.  The game takes place in rounds (one for each player) and they tell the story with the aid of &#8220;Adventure Cards&#8221; (75 of those).  Each adventure card has a story aid, something to inspire the story teller, a title and a Tolkien quote, along with some excellent artwork to really inspire you.  However the other players have similar cards called &#8220;Hazard Cards&#8221; (40 of those) that they use to try to throw the story off.  Things like a goblin patrol, or a group of brigands.This is the real magic of the game, when the players interact with each other in the telling of their (or each other&#8217;s) story.  The goal of course is to score the most points of course but the fun isn&#8217;t in winning or losing the game at large.  We always count up the points and figure out who won, but that&#8217;s just sort of a &#8220;whatever&#8221; moment.  We really enjoy the interaction and getting to tell a well flowing complete story and the opportunity to interject into other&#8217;s stories to tell a bit of the narrative ourselves.Of course there are rules that govern when you can play a hazard card, and how you decide if the hazard card was effective, but the rules are so simple it really took no more than a few minutes to get a full mastery of the games rules.  That&#8217;s a neat feat all of its own.  Most board games require much more attention to the rules.  &#8220;Don&#8217;t I get to&#8230;&#8221; &#8220;shouldn&#8217;t he&#8230;&#8221;  type of questions that make you go back to the rule book and figure out how it works again.  Not so with this.  I haven&#8217;t opened the rules book since the first read through.So this game fits both of my boys perfectly.  I can&#8217;t imagine them liking a game more.  It&#8217;s a board game and the way you play is by telling stories.  It&#8217;s almost as if the game was created specifically for my family (I&#8217;m a LOTR nerd, I admit it).  I&#8217;ve only had the game for 3 days now and already we&#8217;ve played it probably 10 times or more.  No matter how many times we play it it&#8217;s always different (due to the number of cards there are almost unlimited possibilities).  I imagine we&#8217;ll be playing again tonight after dinner.Oh, and I didn&#8217;t really get into the artwork on the cards.  It is fantastic.  Some painted; some more like pen and ink drawings.  All of which feels very much like what you&#8217;d expect in a Tolkien inspired game.  I believe some of it is used in the illustrations in the One Ring manuals as well (the art direction of the game has the same feel even if the game is not the same type of game.I&#8217;ve been very impressed by the selections I&#8217;ve seen from Cubicle7 so far.  I&#8217;m going to have to look into more of their products rather than just the ones in my wheel house (again, Tolkien nerd here).

Such games that followed were &#34;Galactic Empires&#34;, &#34;Sim City&#34;, and even &#34;Dungeons & Dragons&#34;. Not many card games made it past the first couple years, and it's those card games that are the rarest treasure to find anymore.&#34;Wyvern&#34; is no exception to this rule. The concept of &#34;Wyvern&#34; was to make a card game was a bit more fast paces rather than a slow paced thinking game. The game uses the concept of spending &#34;gold&#34; to be able to pay for your dragons to attack or defend. The cards are of very good quality. Unlike most card games that show art work from multiple artists, &#34;Wyvern&#34; only used 1 artist to put artwork on the cards for each card. Also, each card comes with a number on them, as this was also collector cards. The starter deck comes with 60 cards and instructions that explains the rules of the game. Overall, the rules are very simple and easy to understand. (At least for me) One word of caution. According to the instruction manual, card no. 136 is a rare card as well as comes in 2 types, gold and silver. According to the instruction manual, these cards could be redeemed for real cash. Returning the Silver version gave you $15, Gold version gave you $25, and if you returned both cards at the same time, you got $250. Sadly though, it also explains that they stopped doing this as of December 1995. Besides, because the game is so old as well as discontinued (Copyright 1994), I doubt very seriously that they would even offer a working hotline to call for questions.This card deck is mostly for collectors or card gamers, since this game is discontinued and no longer being produced anymore.

The Italian Army used and re-used and it's old equiptment and the author highlights the truck and artillery designed and produced during WW 1 that was still in service in North Africa in 1941-42 in particular the Krupp designed 75-27 CK field gun developed in 1906 {Autocannoni} and a Autoportate based on the 1897 French 75 millimeter field gun. This obsolete ordance was to fight side by side with the Ansaldo 90/53 mm anti-aircraft gun originally developed for the ""Vittorio Vento"" class battleships which was a superb high velocity anti-aircraft and anti-tank gun that was equal to the Krupp 88 mm gun - the best known anti-tank gun of WW 11. The varities and varients of trucks produced by a limited Italian industrial base is quite impressive and were of equal quality to similar German and British equiptment. ""Ad Hoc"" conversion and use of captured British trucks using 65mm, 75mm and 100 mm guns is discussed with these hurried conversions being surprisingly effective.

Squadron/Signal's uber-prolific author David Doyle offers up an 80-page, color guide to this venerable warhorse in B-25 MITCHELL WALK AROUND, a 2012 S/S release.Though Mitchells were produced in a variety of models, Doyle's book concentrates its photography on B-25D, B-25H and B-25J models. Each of the three models is given nose-to-tail photo coverage with tons of close-up shots and air-to-air pix as well. With the  exception of one or two wartime b&w; photos, all images are in color and depict surviving Mitchell warbirds.

There are several interior photos that to me were difficult to understand exactly what I was seeing and where it was located, because of the lack of context. Some larger photos taken with a wide angle lense would have solved that problem.Overall, this is a high-quality publication at a reasonable price. If the subject matter interests you, you should definitely buy it. Better yet, buy it with its companion volume in the In Action seriesB-25 Mitchell in Action - Aircraft No. 221. For less than $40, you can have a detailed understanding of this important aircraft of World War II.",4.0,Excellent reference about an important aircraft,1371772800,"06 21, 2013",Toys_and_Games,1.0

They're 8 and 11 years old and I was excited to see them tinkering with what seemed like a ""brain"" toy.The ball is well constructed and provides a fair deal of entertainment as you mess around with how the pieces fit together. The packaging includes a nice booklet about the ball and certain shapes one can make. Unfortunately I found these 2D pictures to be next to useless. What's more is that every shape they showed was very similar to the fully assembled ball. And this brings me to the chief complaint.There just isn't much you can do with these! I tried and tried again with my younger cousins, I'd sit down and say ""Alright, we're going to make something totally different from the ball"" but quite literally every time I tried, I'd come back to the same shape. This is because the pieces are naturally pretty odd and unfortunately don't fit together in lots of interesting ways. And like the other critical reviewer said: if you attempt to make something that doesn't ""lock together"" but is only held together by the magnetic attraction, it will be so slippery and flimsy that you can't do anything with it. The magnets are generally very weak, designed only to pull each piece together for the ball.At this point, I would immediately recommend my favorite desk toy, a cube of neodymium magnet spheres. However, they're very dangerous for young children prone to swallowing them, and not really worth it for any younger kid that can't keep very good track of all 216 magnets (which is very necessary). So, I'll put the decision on you. If you're an adult, I promise you'll enjoy a magnet cube more. If you're buying for a young kid though, this is a good first foray into the world of magnetic tinkering toys. Just keep the cube in mind when they get a bit older.Popular cubes include: Neocube 216pc Magnet Puzzle (Keep Away from Children - Age 14+) and Buckyballs, also available on Amazon (but seemingly not in the catalog of links).",3.0,"Only worthwhile for very young children; otherwise, go for real magnets",1293494400,"12 28, 2010",Toys_and_Games,0.0

Thirty-six plastic pyramids are fitted with magnets so they stick together with a satisfying ""clack"" to form a variety of geometric shapes.  The possibilities for creating stars, polygons, patterns, and random forms are limited only by imagination and accident.  I mention imagination because you can try to recreate the designs in the accompanying 96-page information booklet.  But accident, I found, was a much more satisfying process.  The pieces seem to ""jump"" into place forming surprise designs that, like a stream of consciousness, lead to further discoveries.  And this is one of the major intentions of this kinetic toy.Roger von Oech is the author of A Whack on the Side of the Head, a book which describes the creative process and offers exercises to flex the inventive muscles.  He designed the Ball of Whacks to take advantage of the connections between the hand, the brain, and the creative process.  As our hands manipulate the whack pieces, our brain slips into a state of flow - critical for creativity.  So simply maneuvering the pieces becomes the most obvious way to make this toy an essential part of your creative work.In addition, the information booklet gives more than a dozen suggestions for inducing the creative process for individuals, partners, and small groups.  Use it as you meditate.  Think of it as a metaphor for a problem.  Start a brainstorming session.

Most ""new"" methods are simply restatements or reshapings of ideas that flourished among the ancient Greeks (such as Heraclitus, a favorite source for Mr. von Oech) or before.  Those who are familiar with the earlier work usually don't gain much from the newer approaches.  The Ball of Whacks is a happy exception.  Heraclitus would say that you can never interact with the Ball of Whacks twice in the same way.  And he would be right.The most valuable creativity-enhancing methods I've experienced usually require having a team work together, with one of the tasks involving making little models or prototypes of creative concepts.  I often find myself wishing I could have those experiences more often . . . but seldom having the right people and time to pursue that desire.Then, I discovered Roger von Oech's Ball of Whacks. Wow!My frustrations are now behind me.This is day 8 of working with the Ball of Whacks.  It's been quite an education.  I can hardly wait to find out what I'll learn on day 9!When you first see the Ball of Whacks, you won't quite know what to make of it.  Open the box, take out the ball, the magnetic stand and the workbook.Then, let yourself go.  Discover what the ball is.  To the geometrically inclined, you'll notice that it's a rhombic triacontahedron (try saying that 5 times fast!), a ball-like shape with edges formed by 30 rhombi (a rhombus is a four-sided equilateral with two pairs of parallel sides) that resemble scaled-down versions of an Egyptian pyramid done in red.  The ball feels somewhat alive, however.  It gives when you squeeze it and resumes it shape when you stop squeezing it.  As soon as you take out a piece, you'll discover that the ball is composed of 30 design blocks that use magnetism to adhere to one another.As you take the pieces apart, the ball disappears and many regular and irregular shapes occur. Usually, that's the end for me.  I can never recover the original shape (my Rubik's cube is still a mess!), but the ball is easy to reform (if I can do it, you can too).I like abstract shapes and I was pleased to find that the magnets act both to attract and repel the pieces. Unlike Lego pieces, connections can be made in all kinds of odd ways.  I also noticed that the pieces often reshape themselves, almost organically, as they choose a different connection than the one that I initiated. The casual results are often better than my planned ones.Based on a suggestion in the workbook, I began mixing in other objects that could be held by the design blocks.  The results were infinitely more interesting and rewarding than anything I'd ever created before.  I felt a great sense of peace from the experience.  Many people had told me I would like sculpting, but I lacked the confidence to try.  With the Ball of Whacks, I felt like a super sculptor . . . but without any lessons.After several days of working on abstract shapes, I decided to try geometric shapes.  These were paradoxically harder to do in many cases.  The magnetism sometimes fought me.  I had to design clever solutions to create the regularity I wanted to see.I also left the Ball of Whacks out to see what others would say.  Everyone noticed that I kept changing it.  Without thinking, rewarding new designs would emerge in a few seconds.  I gained confidence in my creativity involving forms.At the same time, I was working on a number of non-physical problems.  Soon, I began seeing metaphors in the blocks and my designs for those problems.  New and better solutions began to flood my mind.Feeling like I should read more of the workbook, I now found myself intrigued by the directions for how to use the Ball of Whacks to expand my creative repertoire.  I began to see huge gaps between the methods I prefer to use, gaps that I could easily explore and understand with my new appreciation of my creativity habits.Best of all, the lessons are deeply ingrained.  The human nervous system is mostly made up of connections between the hands and eyes to and from the brain.  By both holding and seeing what I was working on, the exercise connects more parts of my brain and experience.  I find totally different memories being stimulated, especially those from the sandbox and while playing with modular toys.Today, I went back and totally redid a book proposal I'm working on.  I was astonished to see that my mind was connecting those little blocks from The Ball of Whacks into new ways of assembling the pieces of the proposal.  I would never have expected that.What does the name mean?  I don't think there's just one meaning.  It obviously sounds like ""ball of wax"" which is something that warms and becomes malleable in our hands.  I'm reminded of the red wax that you peel off of Edam cheese to form shapes.  At another level, a ""whack"" in von Oech's vocabulary is a way of getting you to let go of artificial assumptions.  In that sense, this is a tool to give you lots of whacks.  And it does.I haven't done all of the exercises yet, but I plan to.  Each of the ones I've done has been quite an eye-opener.Here's a tip.  Turn off the TIVO while you're watching television and use the commercial breaks to play with the Ball.  The baseball playoffs are excellent for this purpose because you get all kinds of short delays.Be smart.  Give a Ball of Whacks to each of your children rather than purchasing another toy.  You'll inspire genius that will constantly fascinate you.",5.0,An Epochal Innovation Breakthrough!,1160524800,"10 11, 2006",Toys_and_Games,1.0

However, they drop pieces (accidentally) often; one piece was lost last year under an immovable object . . .  Having 29 instead of 30 pieces has made no difference in the popularity of the Ball of Whacks, however.b) The dang thing is so popular that pieces of it have begun to disappear this year.  I honestly think, unfortunately, that people are stealing 2 or 3 pieces at a time, to fiddle with in their pocket or whatever.  I did not have that problem last year at all, but so far this year (and it isn't Thanksgiving yet!), my 29 pieces have shrunk down to just 20 pieces.  I've considered buying a new Ball of Whacks because the kids like it so incredibly much, but I hate to encourage stealing . . .

Ariel made some of the cleverest games in print at the time and this was arguably one of their two best offerings (the other being Diplomacy).I bought the Avalon Hill first edition version, played it keenly, but had to sell it in lean times. Later I bought this one.The game is a light-hearted (but not comical) look at the Wars of the Roses. Players construct factions of Nobles, give them titles and jobs that grant them physical and political clout using cards, and storm all over England grabbing Yorkist and Lancastrian heirs to the throne, killing off the opposition's heirs when possible, trying not to get sieged, ambushed or plagued to death and scheming to be in possession of the last legitimate Heir to The Throne - at which point the game ends, typically with demands for a rematch sometime soon.Games last from an hour to maybe three hours depending on player familiarity and in-game factors (summoning parliament can cause long pauses in action as players lobby for favor in the form of titles and offices).The playing pieces are made of sturdy card and feature very well printed heraldic designs identifying actual noble families involved in the Wars of the Roses.The board is the usual three-part bifold affair for Avalon Hill. I use plastic clips to hold the board sections together.There are no dice involved in the basic game as the combat is a very abstract ""turn a card"" thing.One thing not mentioned in the Avalon Hill Version is the ability to ""deal in"" a late arrival and have them join the fun even for a game that has been running some time. Once seated at table, no player can be eliminated, as if they lose all their nobles there is a mechanism for giving them new ones. All in a game sold years before so-called ""European Games"" ""invented"" that concept.This Johnny-come-lately deal-in might seem an untenable position, but even the most established force on the board can be lost to plague if they enter a town or city and they will have to at some point, opening the game up to the smaller factions.Not only that, a large and powerful faction can be split by the demands of office in an eyeblink. Creative use of jobs can hamstring even the best player as his faction is robbed of the Warden of the Northern Marches - who has to go to the Scottish Border to quell rebellion - and the Warden of the Cinque Ports - who gets called to Dover.Avalon Hill also used to offer a variant event deck for this game that was oodles of fun. I have no idea if it can be sourced today.This is avowedly not a simulation (though Avalon Hill made a gallant try to introduce a simulation element in the ""Advanced Game"" it isn't worth the effort and sorta misses the point). It is, however, more fun that a dose of the plague while visiting York with two bishops and an heir with a coronation in mind.Highly recommended.",5.0,One Of The Best Games Ever Invented,1379376000,"09 17, 2013",Toys_and_Games,1.0

The Jester and Wizard cards add some fun twists to the outcome, and if you fall behind initially, you can still catch-up as the number of cards per hand increase at the end.My only complaint, and the reason I only give it 4 stars, is that the cards tend to get sticky with extended use, and given you can shuffle the deck 15 to 20 times per game, the cards get a lot of handling.  A plastic card surface would have been better.  The best solution I have found is to purchase more than one set.  I am sure the manufacturer, with whom I am not affiliated, loves me for saying that.By the way, my family sometimes shortens the game time by choosing a subset of the total hands used to play a game.  So for 4 players, instead of dealing hands with 1 to 15 cards, we will play hands of, say, 2, 4, 7, 9, 10, 13, and 15 cards.",4.0,Great game - cards get sticky,1290988800,"11 29, 2010",Toys_and_Games,1.0

(Two2Six, 500, 5Dimension, Sticheln, Zing!, Raj, Nicht die Bohne!, Clubs, and many other games/decks all have at least 15 ranks in at least 4 suits - and most are better quality cards.)The most frustrating thing, though, is that the Jokers and Wizards are unsuited.  Or more accurately, each of those 8 cards has their own suit which does not match the standard suits or any suit on the other cards.

Also, write down the side of the score sheet either who is dealing (we use deals) or who leads for each hand.  It is important to know who is leading the round.  The first game we played (3 people) took about 1-1/4 hours.  Each subsequent game was quicker, even though we had up to 6 people.

Personally, I'm not too keen on the idea of fighters, seeing as how any kind of fleet action clutters up the board tremendously already, not to mention brings the speed of the game down to a screeching halt. Nevertheless, these are an important part of Star Fleet Battles, and are worth giving a chance.They do represent the logical outgrowth of how ship battles in this universe could have evolved over the years. I know then in my own SFB games, I very much like launching every shuttle I have and using their little Ph-3's as a swarm of insects to attack my foe's downed shields. This module allows for that tactic, except on steroids!In a lot of ways, the Fighter battles in SFB reminds me a lot of the ship-to-ship / fighter battles you see in the newest Battlestar Galactica show. This came out long before that show, though. You almost get the feeling that the writers of BSG liked Module J, at least subconsciously...Also, this module has some neat scenarios. Who can not like the scenario called ""Tomcats Over Leebyah""? Featuring a fictional planet called ""Leebyah"", ruled by the evil dictator ""Klodhoppi"". Haha, that is just too funny. And no, I am not making that up! Who said the creators of SFB can't have a sense of humor?So yes, the inclusion of fighters does underscore the concept that this is Star Fleet Battles, not Star Trek. That part is a bit jarring, given how seamlessly most of the other SFB units would fit into the Star Trek universe. But the idea is still cool. And it is something different. I'll have to play some of these scenarios before I can really pass judgment on them.Thanks for reading!",4.0,"Well sir, you can't get the toothpaste back in the tube!",1374796800,"07 26, 2013",Toys_and_Games,1.0

The product itself is a nice self-made book that is way overpriced but a precious one-of-a-kind keepsake.  We live on a military base overseas and use the base USPS for all of our purchase from the US.  When we did this with my son, we got the product back via USPS in about 8 weeks.  The customer service was wonderful.  About 2 months after we sent in my daughters book to be published, we received an email stating they could't ship it to an USPS military address.  For those that don't know, military USPS get shipped to a place in CA and from there the military takes it to whatever destination in Asia.  It is a normal 5 digit zip code in the zone of CA, so there is no special work that needs to be done other than a customs form.  I asked them to look into it again since they had sent it this way before and were utilizing the USPS&#8230;it took over 2 months for any responses.  The delays in the emails continued.  Supposedly, 6 months after we purchased this, it is in the mail to a stateside relative that we will have to reimburse to send it here.  No where does it say it will not ship to any military address or we would not have used them.  The company says they are going through some internal changes right now.  Not a company I would use again for any of their products due to their poor customer service, poor handling of issues, and poor shipping policies that are not clearly stated.",1.0,Worst Company!

It also helps her understand the need to plan ahead.The kit comes with pages outlined to draw/write the cover and pages of your own book.

We usually do this over a few days so that he can really focus on the illustrations, doing a good job with those. By far, his favorite part is the dedication page...because he gets to write about his friend who he has selected to dedicate the book to. Then, he enjoys picking out which color  book cover will be for this particular story! We order an extra book so that his friend is presented with one dedicated just to him.

She loves to write and draw, so it was a perfect gift.  We bought her another one last year, so she now has 2 of her own published books. :-)  These are wonderful keepsakes to have to show your children's creative sides.  My 5 year old wants one now too, even though she is only a beginning writer.  I have also purchased several to give as gifts, and they were all well received.I think overall this is a fantastic gift for a child, and am planning on purchasing more in the future. Much better than the same old plastic toys that get used for a day and then never played with again.  These would be my only recommendations/constructive criticism:-The last book that we got didn't have an area to check off and pay for the 'About The Author' page.  It was included in the first box, which was why I knew about it. That was one of my daughter's FAVORITE parts!  So glad that we still got to do it, since I called and asked if that was still an option.-The order sheet could be less confusing.  Perhaps it has since been improved, but I thought the last one wasn't very clear. Just seemed confusing.-I would make it VERY clear that all of the pages that are included with the book are NOT pre-paid for.  Perhaps have 2 separate packs of paper: one that includes the pages that ARE included, and the rest could be clearly labeled that they are extra (fees) if used.  With the first book, my daughter immediately wrote out her story using all of the papers, so I was pretty much forced to pay for the extra.  It was fine, but if they had been in a separate plastic wrapping, that would have prevented her from using every last page.  I completely understand why it's done that way, however.Either way, my daughters love these books and in fact I just gave this site to my inlaws as a Christmas gift idea for my girls.

After speaking with customer service, I discovered that unless you pay extra to have an electronic copy made, the original pages the child draws on are simply bound into a book. The markers provided in the kit bleed through on the back so you see this when you turn the page.  It takes forever to get the book back which I can't understand if they're simply binding the existing pages. I've made quite a few books on Shutterfly and Winkflash.  From time to time, they have promotional offers where you can get up to 100 pages for under $20 (less than the cost of Illustory). You can upload photos or scan a drawn picture and upload that.  Also, with either company you don't have a word limit of 20 words per page.  Depending on the size of the font you choose, you can type in 200 words or more per page with either service.  The other drawback with Illustory that I didn't discover until speaking with customer service is that if you don't pay extra, they will auto correct the misspelled words. My nephew made up some crazy character names and I had to write a special note with the order stating to leave the text unedited. Good concept but too many rules and limitations.

In a fun way he learned a lot about setting up a story, creating the tension or drama to make it interesting, and bringing the story to a conclusion.

The first two I purchased were Christmas presents for my nieces who were 6 and 8 at the time. They are very crafty and love telling stories and I thought this set would be a great way to begin a family tradition of writing their Christmas story or memories that would be published. They absolutely loved it. Both girls sat, mapping out their stories and pictures to have the best final draft possible. The third Illustory I purchased was for my daughter (6) to write a book for her father for his birthday last year. Her published copy brought him to tears when he opened it. Now, I'm buying another copy at the request of my daughter (7)  to write another book for her dad as a present for Christmas. What I love, besides the published book, is the documentation of the child's handwriting, pictures, and creativity from year to year. It is such a great keepsake for the future.Creations by You does a fantastic job with clear directions to follow for a mail in order verse an online order as well as completing the entire book process by hand or digitally. They also provide plenty of extra book pages in case the kids made a mistake and needed to re-write or re-draw one of their pictures. Which happens quite a bit at this age. They also allow for digital pictures to be uploaded or sent in if you want a picture to be included in on the page about the author or have the child complete the book digitally.Finally, the final project. I was apprehensive about mailing in my child's work and even took color photocopies of it before sending it to not loose all the hard work if something went wrong. It was an unnecessary precaution because the book came back in the designated time and the pages were perfect. The final product is well crafted and my child's work was showcased beautifully. I would highly recommend purchasing this kit for the avid writer or creator or as a way to give a beautiful present or keepsake for the future to document a child's creativity.",5.0,I Just Keep Buying Them,1382918400,"10 28, 2013",Toys_and_Games,1.0

We've created a 'library' where her sister checks the books out and has used them to develop her own reading/story telling/drawing skills (she's now 5 and reading beyond everyone else in her kindergarten class and our 7 year old is beyond her class in reading skills, too).These have already become a tradition in our family, and our 5 year old is going to begin her set this Christmas.  We think these products alone have dramatically helped our kids become early readers who enjoy reading, story telling/development, planning, attention to detail, drawing/coloring and even inspired our 7 year old for a possible career.  Yes, they've had THAT much of an impact.Yet another benefit of the product is that book comes later in the mail, which is like anticipating/getting another present all over again (excitedly checking the mail and asking 'is it here yet?!').  The books are well-made and don't peel apart like you might think.  The hard-covers are bright colored and have a good feel, as do the pages/colors of the books.  One of their favorite aspects is the 'About the author' section - it makes them feel like 'grown ups' who actually wrote and published a book.The kit includes a postage-paid envelope so it is super-easy to ship out the pages - you don't have to mess with stamps or anything.  Zip it and ship it!Easily one of the best gifts of my kidos early lives and great keep-sakes for them.  The pride they have in showing off the books to their friends and relatives is really inspiring to watch.A few tips -1) work with your youngster to plan out the story on your own paper - even though there are plenty of extra 'pages' included in the kit, I find it is better to draft it out a few times.  If your child is really young, you can have them simply 'tell you the story' and you write it down on the pages.2) use some of the extra pages to let them practice and get the idea3) consider having the kids write the words/story on other paper and then you proof/copy the words onto the pages to avoid any 'oops'4) These are top-quality products; however, don't let the kids go crazy with the markers before they actually use them to make their pages.  My kids started using the markers for 'everyday use' and we needed to nip that so they didn't run out of ink.5) Our 7 year old has proudly taken them for show-and-tell and the other kids love themYou will simply not be disappointed with this product.",5.0,Growth and development SUPER-GIFT for kids!,1382745600,"10 26, 2013",Toys_and_Games,1.0

Very nice for my child who loves to write! The website has a great variety of clipart for her pictures or she could scan and upload her own pictures (which we did not do). She found plenty of clip art on the website to go along with her story. When her order was placed, the confirmation told us 10-14 days and she had her book by the end of the week (less than 7 days!)

She was 4 when she started it and 5 when she finished. We used the markers provided with the kit, but also Crayola's Pip Squeaks washable markers, which came out fine.After she finished each drawing, I uploaded it to the website. I liked this option because it enables you to write and design much more-- you can control the layouts (picture on top or bottom? Text or no text? All handmade drawings, or add ""stamps"" and online design elements?). You can make the fonts bigger or smaller and get far more words in per page than if you send in the kit by mail and have a small word limit.There were no additional expenses whatsoever beyond the cost of the kit. A couple of reviewers seemed confused (or paranoid) about that... the company doesn't try to ""get you."" You pay for the kit, they'll mail you a book. If you want extra copies, of course you pay for that. But aside from that, we got back a beautiful book with an author photo just by typing in the tracking number that's inside the kit on the online order form.

IlluStory has passed the test 3 times already and I expect it to pass for the rest as well. In our family, we give IlluStory as a Christmas gift for our 7 year olds. It is an extra special gift because the books created by the older children are such special keepsakes that when it is the next one's turn there is always much excitement.We don't rush through the steps of storywriting, illustrating, and publishing; but instead, take it slowly and really let our children create something meaningful to them. IlluStory is a great tool to bridge the gap from easy readers and copywork to creative writing. In fact, it is the very first creative writing exercise I give to my children. And because it is such a positive experience and produces such quality results, writing goes on to be a pleasant and enjoyable activity rather than the drudgery that it can be for some.I encourage my children to do the illustrations themselves, but the drawing made one of my sons anxious, so the digital option was a great benefit. We also like the fact that it is possible to order multiple copies as gifts.

My 7 year old son has now published THREE books and is so proud and ecstatic every time a new book arrives at our doorstep!  The entire process is extremely user/kid friendly.  If you choose to do so, you can write the story and illustrate the pictures on the included sheets of paper and then mail it in to Student Publishing.  Although we purchase the box set (it comes with lots of great fiction and non-fiction writing tips for my son), we choose to upload the story via the website (studentpublishing.com) rather than mailing in the hard copy of the book.  My son writes his story on the included paper and I type the words into the program for him.  Once I have typed in the words, I will show him each page and he draws an illustration for that page.  We upload his images and presto, we have a completed book in no time flat!  If you choose not to upload your own images, you can use pre-designed pages and ""color"" them online in any way you wish.  You can also add ""stickers"" and clip art images to the background images.The online program used to feel dated and it would take me forever to upload images, etc.  However, for our last two books, the program has been running very smoothly.  I'm guessing they have made the appropriate updates to accommodate the nuances of the program/volume of customers utilizing the online option.The quality of the books really is fantastic!  The ""About the Author"" page is simply adorable and the illustrations that we upload are beautiful and maintain every bit of detail!  My son's drawings look exactly like my originals in both quality and scale.  We also upload an illustration for the cover.  It is just as beautiful as the pages inside of the book.  The binding and quality are superior to anything you could get through an online photo company.To address what previous reviewers have said about word and page limits, this is not an issue if you choose to type the story online and upload your illustrations.  By typing the words (I let my son write them on the included sheets and I type it into the program online for him) you are allowed more characters per page.  Also, I'm pretty sure the page limit is 18.  This is quite sufficient given the characters you are allotted per page.  My son's first book was 12 pages, his second 15 and this most recent book was 17.To address other negative reviews regarding this product:1)  Yes, you can pay for the kit or purchase the book online.  If you get the kit, you DO NOT have to still pay the $ for your book to be published.  Your kit comes with a # that you enter at checkout to get your ""free"" book.  You can choose to pay an additional 20-something dollars to order extra copies of your book.  My son gives his books as gifts to grandparents, so I always order a copy for myself to  keep.  Also, your books are saved in your online account and you (or another family member) can go online at any time and order additional copies.&#8195;2) As I have said before, we have purchased three books (over a year and a half).  All have arrived within 2-3 weeks of submitting our order and the pages have NEVER bled at all.  As a matter of fact, the pages are very thick and high quality.  Much nicer than any of the other books we own from ""real"" published authors!!Illustory really is a phenomenal product and I intend to use it with my two boys for years to come.  I love that we have a library of THEIR publications!  We haven't yet used the comic book creator, but we intend to buy each boy one for Christmas!

Use the writing utensils and materials provided in the kit for the final copy - as some other reviewers have mentioned here, if you use your own pens, there may be ink 'bleed' in your final version. When you order your published copy, be sure to use the prepaid envelope to send it in, or if you are online, use the code that comes with your kit to get your included version.

They provide you with ample pages (we only used half of the pages provided to us) for your child to create their story on.  At the top of the page, there is an area for drawings and then below that, an area to write a sentence or two. My personal preference was to have my child use her own handwriting to draw her pictures and write her story. However, illuStory provides additional choices of using electronic images and typed written words.  So you have many options to choose from as you explore your creativity.  When your done creating all the pages, just use the enclosed envelope and mail them in.  In just a few weeks, you will receive your personalized hardcover book.This year, I am having my daughter create one page at a time.  That way, we can capture the entire year thru my daughters eyes as we have vacations, celebrate holidays, go to the beach, etc.  I also plan on having her school and sports teachers complete their own page, along with Grandma and myself and have that added into the book as a surprise for her.

She'd much prefer to write a short story, complete with her own illustrations.  After having a few completed masterpieces sitting about the house, my daughter lamented that she wished she could have it published 'like a real book'.  So my search began, and ended, with this product.  She received it as a Christmas gift, and almost immediately began working on her story (titled 'I'm a Superhero!').  Following the simple, clear instructions in the package, we were able to send off our manuscript for publication.  It did take a little bit to receive the completed product back; in fact, I even emailed the manufacturer to inquire about it as I was worried it may have gotten lost.  Never fear, though, it arrived shortly afterward, and my daughter was thrilled with the hardcover book which she had written, illustrated and designed (by choosing the book color, fonts, etc.)  I love the 'About the Author' page too, and it's so worth it get it printed with your child's picture.  Imagine her face when she sees it!  We even purchased a second one to give to her on her birthday, and this time we tried the internet option.  The advantage here is that you can make the text of each page as long as you want, instead of the rather restrictive 20-word limit per page on the mail-in version.  The drawback, though, is that the drawings will not have that kid-drew-it innocense since the illustrations are also made on the computer.  Having done both versions, I think we'd stick with the internet version from now on, so she can write more and more complex stories as she gets older.

College educated education major, now I am a stay-at-home mom.  With one income coming in; I search high and low for a bargain.  I shop yardsales, and thrift stores to get gently used items rather than ever pay retail.  However, I NEVER have a problem putting Illustory on the 'pay full price and get this thing' list.We always get these for our kids because it is a wonderful way to share time with them as you create a story together(my daughter like to have me illustrate a story she writes - and trust me I am no Picasso). It is also a wonderful way for your kids to express who they are by...get this...actually writing and drawing.  NO ELECTRONIC GADGET is ever going to give your child the satisfaction they get when their very own creation comes back in a beautiful printed book.Can you make your own book at home?  Sure, but it's not the same and I can't make a hardcover book, can you?In my humble opinion, this is a home run gift for any ocassion.  I also suggest more board games as gifts.  You can't beat spending time with your kids as an antidote to all the garbage competing for their attention in the world.By the way, why not have your kids use this 'book' to write and draw about a family member and give the published book to that person.  For ex:  a book about the things they love to do with Gram/Gramps or an uncle, or even an teacher!  There are so many ways this product could be used!

We ordered a second for the grandparents and they were thrilled.  He really liked the &#34;about the author&#34; part in the back.  It was an enjoyable project for him to do and I have a nicely preserved momentous from his childhood.  I think the standard option is great for a young child only, because of the twenty word limit per page.  I really thought that was limiting.  He always had more to write.  Their is an option for more words, but it has to be done online.  Also, the pages are printed on one side and the backs of the pages are visible as they were colored.  That means that the marker shows through on the opposite side of the page.  Still, would recommend this product. ( we didn't finish the project when we first purchased it.

The kit contains about 30 or so pages, each with a designated space for the illustration and lines at the bottom for the handwritten text. It included markers, a postage paid return envelope, directions, and a guide on how to write a story (who are your characters, what is the conflict, how will the story end). To avoid having to pay for additional pages, since only 20 words are allowed per page and the whole story must be 12 pages or less, we storyboarded my DDs story on our own.This is a big project. My DD spent 4 days, maybe an hour or so each day. I don't know what the average time spent would be, but she put a lot of effort into the drawings. She and I enjoyed the project from start to finish.I was impressed with the completeness of the kit and the email contact from the company from start to finish. Illustory sent emails when the manuscript was received and when it was shipped. We received the book in less than 2 weeks from when we sent it in though based on the info included, this was a very fast turnaround.My DD was so pleased with the result. The book is made of the actual pages submitted which surprised me (though I think there is an option to upgrade). Some of the marker bled through to the back of the pages but this didn't bother my daughter or me. The cover is well made and the typewritten story exactly matched the manuscript with no typos. The dedication page and author bio page are great and included free.I totally recommend this for other new short story writers.

I am able to see his development as a writer by reading these books and he has so much pride seeing works he created on his shelves beside authors such as Dr. Seuss, Jeff Kinney, and E. B. White. My point is, to say we enjoyed Illustory products is an immense understatement. I am also an elementary educator and have used these products as classroom activities in the past. Unfortunately, I no longer feel Illustory is taking a child-centered approach to their dealings with clientele and they are causing more harm to children than good by taking the stories, written by young children, and ignoring their families when they ask where the product they paid for and were eagerly waiting for is. Once an award-winning product, Illustory seems to have fallen into the hands of the careless and incosiderate, and that's the best case scenario. What these children create may not be on the NY Times Bestseller's List, they are of no less importance to us. I will be seeking any future book creation services from your competitors.

The kit comes with everything that you need to create the book: worksheets for the brainstorming and outlining process, a place to record the author's information and dedicate it to someone special, pages to create your story, and a special page to design a cover with your own artwork.  Your child writes the story (HINT: you can use more words per page by creating a word template with the correct margins and typing the text yourself), draw the pictures, and send the completed packet in to the company.  You can pay extra for special features and additional copies, but if you just want a standard, hard cover copy of your book, there is no additional cost after purchasing the kit.  The book arrives in your mailbox looking like something you'd see in the library, except that it's your child's special work!We use an Illustory every year as a homeschool project during the spring semester.  My son's stories often revolve around something fun that happened during the year or something that we studied.  Each year I can see how his sentences grow more complex and his vocabulary improves compared to his previous books.  I can also see the development in his fine motor skill through the details in the illustrations on each page.

We had to order extra copies because they wanted to give one to their teachers (for the library) and to their Grandparents. We will definitely be ordering more of these kits.

Okay, if you are a novelist, of course, go to self publishing for greater production numbers.  But, if you are intimidated by the whole process of publishing your short story, poetry or artwork, this is a way to do it-low risk.  I think you can do up to 50 pages at a reasonable fee per page beyond the allowed amount. An older child may not get excited about the kit until you show them what they can do with on-line publishing. The company's website has some sample books you can view.I bought the Creations by You Illustory Kit for my son who was about 10 at the time.  He was more interested in cartoon drawing (which they now have a kit for which I bought), so I decided to use it myself to create a book of inspirational sayings for my Goddaughter.  I communicated by email and phone with a representative when I didn't know how to create what I wanted to do in their on-line format.  The representative was patient and easy to follow.The end result was a beautiful 50 page book with a painting on the cover, text in various fonts and colors, and, artwork or photos on each page (double-sided.) I was able to use as many words as I could fit in a Word document which I saved in PDF in order to be uploaded.  Photos can also be easily uploaded. You can also superimpose words over images or anything else you can do in a word document, before uploading to your book. The system allows you to move the pages around as often as you'd like and add and delete as needed. You do have to pay for additional pages and books, but the cost is reasonable.  I was working on a deadline, and, even though it was their busiest time of year, the company worked quickly on my order and I got the books in less than three weeks.  After a few months, I did have trouble with the binding on one of the books, but I sent it back and they repaired it satisfactorily. When you get your kit, read the instructions carefully, particularly if you want to publish on-line. I'd also recommend you buy an extra copy for a keepsake if your child will be using the book a lot. The books aren't indestructible. They do sell plastic covers for them, but I can't comment on the covers since I did not purchase them.Overall, these kits are awesome and the company is very customer friendly.  It is an American company who also has a publishing program for teachers and their students to help advance literacy.  I would recommend the kits for any age, especially when using on-line publishing.",5.0,"I would recommend this kit for ANYONE, ANY AGE",1382745600,"10 26, 2013",Toys_and_Games,1.0

She worked for many days on her story -- writing, drawing, coloring.  After she was done, I scanned her work and submitted it over the internet.  There is an option for mailing it in, but I wanted to include a photo of her in the author section.Online, I found that many more options for  fonts and formatting are available.  Only twenty words per page are allowed when submitting by mail.  We can exceed that limit by submitting the work online.The book is limited to twelve pages (unless one wants to pay additional fees), but it comes with lots of extra pages for drafting or fixing errors or just making a longer book.  My son was intrigued by the process and took some pages to make his own book.The hardcover book that came in the mail today was small, but my daughter loves it.  She's been reading it over and over and shares it with everyone she knows.DETAILSThe Illustory price includes the cost of mailing in the story pages and the shipping fee of the final product.The company proofreads the story and prints it.  One may opt to have it printed with the child's misspellings and even in the child's own handwriting.Online, the illustrations can be scanned in and uploaded or else the child may choose from the available illustrations.  We used my daughter's drawings, so I did not peruse much and don't really know what they offer.NEEDS IMPROVEMENTFor the same price, one could print the same book on Snapfish.  It would be bigger and come with twenty pages instead of twelve.  It would take less time to process and arrive much sooner.My daughter's book was submitted April 24 and didn't get here until today, June 2.  That's a long time for an anxious little girl to wait.Of course, Snapfish charges shipping and handling, but they do have coupons.CONCLUSIONDespite the pricing, my daughter was inspired by the Illustory layout, which showed her where the pictures go and where her words would be.  That helped inspire her more than a blank piece of paper ever could.This is a parent friendly gift.  I appreciate it so much more than any toy.  My daughter now has something that will last a lifetime -- her very first book!  She is so proud of it.  This was fun, educational, and milked her creative juices.P.S. FOR TEACHERSIllustory does give free books to classrooms.  They are soft cover, but the whole bookmaking process is the same.

But I'm only giving it the extra star because of that. I'm still overall unhappy with this company and our most recent books. I won't reiterate the issues that I've already covered. But soon after I wrote this original review I was contacted on here by someone from the company who told me to again follow-up with their customer service dept. So I did. They did get back to me but had no new news for me - my books were still unaccounted for and they'd be in touch. But I never heard back anything.... until a couple of weeks ago when they emailed me to say both of my kids' books had been found and that they were being printed to be delivered soon. I am still uncertain how the books went missing for so long, but FINALLY - five months after sending them in - we received them. But here are the problems I found with the two books:-- Three typographical errors between the two books (such as printing the word ""The"" as ""T he"" with a space between letters). Even my seven-year-old quickly noticed the errors.-- The author photos on each book were distorted, though the pictures I sent in were perfectly fine. One picture was quite blurry, the other had lines going across my son's face, as if the ink didn't print correctly.-- No note of apology, follow-up correspondence  or any kind of offer of compensation to try to make up for their losing our books for several months. Granted this was not a necessity but it would have been in good business practice to do so.Bottom line: I'm glad we finally received our books. Despite their errors on the part of the company, they will still be keepsakes of my kids that I will cherish. However, I plan to research other kid-publishing sites for our next round of book-making. I will not order from this company again. And that's too bad.(ORIGINAL REVIEW:)I am giving this a one-star review based on my recent experience with IlluStory. We had two of these kits, one for each kid, and they took a lot of time coming up with their stories and illustrations. We did everything we were supposed to do to put our kit together (this is not the first time I'd completed one of these so I knew what I was doing.) We chose the option to use the kit and have the kids hand draw their pictures (not to create the books online). The books are limiting in the sense that you can only have 20 words per page and a 12 page limit. This is NOT a lot of words to put together a story. But with a lot of time and editing their words down, we managed to do it. Past kits gave you the option to add pages for a price but this latest kit did not give you the option. I took the time to get pictures of each kids for the ""author photo"" and have the correct size printed & picked up at a nearby store. After ALL of this (weeks and weeks in the making), we shipped out our kits using the pre-printed envelopes they provide, guaranteeing correct address. I sent ours off in August 2013. By October (and many ""Where are our books?"" inquiries from my kids) I began to really wonder, too, where they were. I went back through my emails and realized I couldn't find a confirmation email. I tracked down an email address from somewhere on the Creations by You page and wrote to them, explaining the problem. They got back to me within a few days, but unfortunately with no record of our packages arriving. NEITHER of them (we shipped them in their separate envelopes). I exchanged a few emails with a person from their company but to no avail. I have them book titles, descriptions, kids' names but they said they don't have record of them. The emails on their end seem to have just ended. I received no compensation, no coupons, nothing of any kind of to help re-coup the loss of money, time and completely bummed-out kids on my end. Now maybe this was a fluke. Maybe the post office lost BOTH of the envelopes we shipped out. But then I get on Amazon and see that a couple of the most recent one-star reviews since Nov. 2013 sound very similar to my own problem. So what's the deal? The post office is just losing giant Illustory envelopes, ones that are really big with the IlluStory company name, address and logo emblazoned across the front? I had hoped it was a fluke, because I had used one of these kits a few years ago and we DID get our book back. I still have the same gripe about it being limited in my child being able to tell a story (I paid an extra $11 to add pages so she could finish her story! This was on top of the $20-25 originally paid for the kit.) But in the end she was so excited to be ""published"" that it was a worthwhile keepsake. This is what led me to buy the kits again, this time two of them. So, IlluStory, you tell me ... are you running some kind of scam where you ""don't receive"" just enough packets to fly under the radar or is the post office reaaaallllly losing all of those envelopes?",2.0,"""Two Lost Books""",1386374400,"12 7, 2013",Toys_and_Games,0.0

While the older two have yet to really finish anything, the youngest was very eager to get started on the project. I chalk this up more to their personalities rather than how age appropriate the product is.I sat with him and made sure he adhered to the guidelines, which I would recommend. There are limits to the number of words each page can have. So it helps to sort work as an editor to the process in order to keep everything flowing smoothly.Once we were done and sent it out, he checked the mail constantly. It arrived within a few weeks, and we were both really excited to hold a copy of the book in our hands. It's a durable, hardcover book. And I think it gave a real sense of accomplishment for him to have made this PRODUCT, this thing that you could hold onto and show people. His ""what I want to be when I grow up"" became an author. He would frequently relate this to his teacher and grandparents. I think it gives a real connection to the creative process, and we both really enjoyed working on it together.I will say that the only, brief and fleeting moment of disappointment for him was when he realized the pictures in the book were his, and not some professional rendering of what he'd drawn. I had no idea he'd expected this, and quickly allayed the disappointment by telling him how great it was that he'd done it all himself.

I like these cards because they are a great way to open a dialog from a Biblical standpoint.  The card gives you a summarized Bible story, followed by a conversation question.  For example, one of the cards tells the story of Simon from Cyrene helping Jesus carry his cross to Golgotha.  The question then is asked: ""What is the most important thing you have ever done to help someone?""  There's a wide range of possibilities with these cards.  They're great if you want to continue talking about Simon or why Jesus had to die or go on to the topic of helping someone.  There are no wrong answers and no special knowledge of the subject is needed.While it's geared for all ages, not all the cards fit all age groups.  Some questions are more geared to children and some to adult.  For example, one of the cards asks, ""To whom do you tell your secrets?"" while another asks, ""If you had a year's salary to give to a cause, what would you choose?""

The board folds into thirds, so it is long enough to make a good ladybug path.  Each player's piece is a ladybug of a different color.  You draw a card when it is your turn and follow the directions on the card. Some of the cards tell you to go so many spaces forward or so many spaces backwards. The forward and backward cards each have a number on them and arrows telling you which way to go (a green left arrow is forwards and a red right arrow is backwards). If the card has a picture of a ladybug on it, you draw another card and follow those instructions. You might land on a space that gives you similar directions. If you draw a card that says you get 6 aphids, it has a number ""6"" on it and a picture of an aphid on the card, so you don't have to be able to read to play.  At one point, there is a stop sign on the game with a picture of an ant next to it.  You have to stop on that space (even if your card says you can move more spaces) and you have to pay the ant 10 aphids to move forward.The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the aphids are made of thick paper and could be made a little sturdier.  Even plastic coated thick paper (like playing cards) would help.  I would recommend putting all of the aphids in a small baggie to keep them together.  It comes with 2 rubber bands for the cards, but nothing for the aphids. It could also use more aphids.  The first time we played, we played with just one adult and one child and used more than half of the aphids, so if you had 4 people playing (there are 4 moving pieces) you could easily run out of aphids. The playing pieces were also too large if 2 people landed on the same square, which is not a big deal, but could have been easily fixed when the game was designed.",4.0,"Fun, Educational, but some of the parts could be sturdier",1363910400,"03 22, 2013",Toys_and_Games,1.0

We ended up laughing so hard we were crying!  It was crazy.Gameplay:This cards-only version has pretty streamlined play.  Choose a card, select one of the four questions on the card and use the tokens marked 1 & 2 to either vote for your own answer or to guess what the rest of your fellow players will vote for as their answer.  We found the gameplay rather awkward when we voted on our own answers, so we stuck with the ""majority rules"" version.  Ask the question aloud and enjoy the debate as your friends try to agree if they'd rather... for example find out that their house lies on an earthquake fault OR an Indian burial ground.Appeal:While me and my nieces enjoyed the silly, outrageous and, yes, often gross questions, not everyone will find it amusing.  Should repeated questions about body odor or dangerous stunts offend you, you'll hate this.  Most of the cards contain at least one question of a seriously unappealing nature, but it's fun if you're not uptight.Overall:If simple-minded silliness is what you're looking for and you don't want the bulk or bother of the full-blown board game, this pack of cards could be right for you.  A good icebreaker and not a bad little distraction if you should find yourself bored with a couple of silly and open-minded friends.

Further the help bonuses stack, so it's possible (and even automatic) to take out very high level enemies.The poor durability score is due to the plastic holder in the box being already cracked right after unwrapping it.

(I love the cards that parody D&D; spells, and most of Elan's cards are so silly, like ""Gratuitous Nudity"".) You don't even have to know the comic to enjoy it; one of my friends loves this game, and she's never read the comic. Then again, all my friends who have played this with me have been from my Dungeons and Dragons group, so it's probably to be expected that they'd enjoy a game that's based on a comic that's a parody of D&D.; The characters that you get to play are the members of the Order of the Stick: Roy (the intelligent, lawful good, easily annoyed human party leader), Haley (the second in command- she's a loot-obsessed, chaotic good human thief), Elan (the moronic, cheerful, chaotic good human bard/swordsman), Durkon (the good, rather bland, dwarven cleric), Belkar (the probably-evil, bloodthirsty halfling), and Vaarsuvius (the good, gender-ambiguous elven wizard). The point of the game is to move into rooms (room cards get put on the table to create a map, or a kind of ""Clue"" board) and kill enemies to get their treasure, or ""loot"" as the game calls it. You can also attack other players for loot, but my group has its own house rules where we ignore that rule; so far no one playing Belkar has wanted to attack the others, and the rest of the characters don't really need to attack any of the other players.In the game the characters all have their strengths and weaknesses, but balance out pretty well against each other; in theory, Roy and Haley would seem to be the best at the game since they're the ones with the most powerful attacks, but the other characters have just as good a chance at winning the game since beating the final boss (Xykon) isn't what determines the winner- the winner is the person with the most shticks (attack, stealing, and action type cards) and loot cards (these would be the equivalent of gold or money). The trick is to not let the other players pull ahead in how many of these cards they have.For instance, I've read reviews online where people think Haley is too strong; the trick there would be to follow her around and stay on the same floor as her so she asks for help (since the loot without her face on them don't do her any good other than as bribes) instead of letting her go off on her own floor and kill things by herself, hence getting all the loot and making her start getting more powerful shticks where she won't need much help. Also, I've found that players really need to pay attention when there's a Haley in the game; when I played her, no one realized how often I was coming in and stealing their kills and loot until it was too late, which they could have somewhat prevented by not letting her get so powerful early on (make sure you kill an enemy before she can get there, and help, help, help!).It also depends on the luck of the draw- what cards you get, how much loot you can snag in the beginning, and how many shticks you can get early on. I've kicked butt as Elan when I lucked out in getting lots of cards early, but last time someone played Elan without making him follow the other characters, so he ended up falling way behind on loot cards and shticks (the point of Elan is to help other and get loot that way, but you can't do that if you're not on the same floor as the other players). Really, you have to strategize and use what works best for the character you're playing, and everyone has an equal chance at winning.The other problem I've read about in reviews is how long the game runs. It tends to run about 4 hours for my group; we've gotten the game down now so don't have to keep looking up the rules, but when we first started it took longer. But what my group does if the game starts to run long is to make up house rules- for instance, make it be three floors instead of four, or only need six shtick cards at the end instead of eight. The Board Game Police aren't going to come after you if you change the rules up a bit. ;)This game is an awesome alternative to Dungeons and Dragons when some of the group can't make it (since my group doesn't play D&D; if more than one person can't make the game). It also runs about the same time as our D&D; game, which is perfect for us.",5.0,Fun game based on a funny comic,1238284800,"03 29, 2009",Toys_and_Games,1.0

True, I began playing this game not really expecting it to be that great after awhile. In fact, it felt like there were certain things that felt suspiciously similar to games like Munchkin.After giving it a real go, however, I had a very enjoyable time, and before I knew it, 3 hours had gone by. This is one of those games that is hard to recommend to certain people. I'm a pretty hardcore gamer, and I had fun with this, but I don't think it's for everybody. If you like RPG parodies like Munchkin, this will probably be up your alley. The only major difference is that you play as a specific character who gets specific items each game. It isn't as random.But while this game is meant to be light-hearted and fun, it can sometimes be very punishing in difficulty. Yes, sometimes it's the luck of the draw (most results will be based on a 1-12 die roll), but you can also get help from your friends on defeating monsters. That is, if they don't stab you in the back while they're at it.Sure, this game may never be nominated for any game of the year awards, but I feel it does a good job of trying to accomplish what it sets out to do. It's just that there may be games more suited for people who want to play games of this genre. The one thing I will say that I loved about this game though is that it gave me enough freedom to choose from fighting monsters, stealing items from other players, exploring the dungeon, searching for loot, teaming up against other players, and laughing at all the silliness that was going on. So if you don't take your games too seriously, and want something a little more light-hearted, I would recommend picking this one up. Below I'll list some pros and cons I found from playing this:Pros:+ Light-hearted fun for gamers of all experience levels.+ Lots of ridiculous humor specific to each character. They all feel fully fleshed-out.+ The game is different every time you play.+ Expansion pack adds some nice cards, including a variation that makes the game much shorter.+ There is really no way for anyone to ""die"" or ""lose."" Everyone is in the game the entire time without any significant penalties if you DO lose all your HP.+ ""Backstabbing"" other players never feels like anyone is out to get you. That is, unless you do it to others too much...+ One of the few games that is appealing to the non-gamer girlfriend crowd.Cons:- A lot is left up to chance.- Can amount to a pretty long game, even with just two players.- Appeals to a certain niche of gamers. Not every hardcore or casual gamer will probably enjoy this.- Certain rules can be a little difficult to grasp at first- Some monsters are far too common. The idea is that monsters of the same type give each other bonuses, but I would have preferred more variety.",4.0,"If you enjoy RPG parodies, this game is probably for you",1339286400,"06 10, 2012",Toys_and_Games,1.0

This game uses the same rule set as Champions of the Galaxy, a sci-fi themed futuristic wrestling league (if you like comics then CotG will be right up your ally). The game plays best when you book your own events, create your own feuds, and crown your own champions. Filsinger games has an active online community where people share their feds and talk everything wrestling and game related.The intro set includes 24 wrestler cards including: The Road Warriors Hawk and Animal, Nick Bockwinkel, Harley Race, Ted DiBiase, Jimmy Snuka, King Kong Bundy, Buddy Rogers, Bobo Brazil and several more. A match can last only seconds, or the longest match I've played was about 17 minutes. You start out with two wrestler cards (or four in a tag match) and roll to see who goes first. Each wrestler card has 3 levels of offense, and 3 levels of defense. Each level has six actions. The match always starts on level one. Say wrestler A rolls a 4. He looks under Level 1 Offense and number it says something like ""4-Body Slam-1"". The number after the move means that his opponent rolls on level 1 defense. There will be either 1,2, or 3 following a move. The bigger the move, the higher the level of defense the opponent rolls on. The defense is set up the same way, say the opponent rolls a 3 and his L1 defense says ""3-hurt-2"". Then the other wrestler rolls on level 2 offense because of the ""-2"" following the result. There are reversals too, say wrestler B rolls a 5 and it says ""WRESTLER NAME-2"", the move is blocked or reversed and he takes over on level 2 offense. The match continues this way until a wrestler is pinned, counted out, or disqualified. Some moves make use of the charts like when a wrestler is thrown into the ropes, out of the ring, into the turnbuckle, death jump (this is high risk moves, usually top rope moves), pin saves, wrestler or manager interference, or specialty matches. These charts require you to roll two dice and match the result with a column on the chart matching the wrestlers rating. Each wrestler has ""PIN"" under level 3 defense, followed by a number. He rolls two dice, and if it's equal to, or lower than his pin rating the match is over. If the match is not over, then he adds one to his pin rating and the opponent rolls again on level 3 offense. Each wrestler has a finisher, some even have two. They are always numbers 5 and 6 on level 3 offense. These add to the opponents pin rating, it will say something like: ""6-FIGURE FOUR LEG-LOCK(+2)"" When a wrestler rolls a finisher, the opponent automatically rolls his pin and adds the number from the finisher to it.Filsinger Games now has several wrestling games. Newer wrestling feds like Ring of Honor, NWA Championship Wrestling from Hollywood, and Combat Zone Wrestling have licensed sets with color cards. New game editions are constantly coming out and there is even an online version for all of the different games. Check out the website for Filsinger Games, there's even a free trial for the online game with four free cards: Rob Van Dam, Jimmy Snuka, and two characters from Champions of the Galaxy, Bloodline and Encubus.If you like wrestling and table top games, this is a great game.

They help tremendously with getting ready in the morning and getting ready at bedtime.  I don't use the tokens that come with the system.  I think the instructions say it won't work without the tokens, but I found them unnecessary after the 1st month of getting used to the system.  Then they became more of a bother than they were worth.  My kids are just expected to do their cards. In the morning they must have their yellow cards done before they're allowed to play or watch morning shows & at bedtime they must have them done before our timer goes off in order to get their bedtime story (they  almost always get them done because that's a big motivator).  Now, my 2 1/2 year old has been requesting chore cards, so I'm getting a set for her. I like that you can individualize the cards.  You can choose which ones you want to use & it also comes with blank stickers so you can make up your own.  It is easy to adapt by age.  For example, my 6 year old has more cards that she's responsible for doing than my 4 year old, and my 2 year old will start out with just a few.  I've actually considered getting one for myself because it is such a good visual reminder of what has been completed and what still needs to be done. It helps me to not have to nag the kids.  I just have to remind them to ""go do your cards.""  The tokens might be great for some families. If you don't use the tokens, you will want some type of incentive for getting the cards done, or it will be just one more thing to nag about.",5.0,Great product for chores for little ones,1187395200,"08 18, 2007",Toys_and_Games,1.0

When it finally appeared in 2004, a couple of years after Sackson's death, it went on to win Games Magazine Game of the Year award in 2005, and many consider it a ""modern classic in the making"".  This particular edition is the Face2Face edition, and a deluxe edition also appeared in 2011 courtesy of Gryphon Games.Let's be honest that the genre of word games isn't everybody's cup of tea. But this one is different, because it introduces a simple economy to the game. The letter tiles in the game have dots on them, and the amount of dots in a collection of tiles will determine its buying and selling price. Players first must buy tiles, and then try to sell them at a profit ideally by making large words with lots of dots.The economic element that Sackson has incorporated presents an interesting twist on the traditional point-scoring model associated with most word games, and works really well. It avoids some of the pitfalls associated with Scrabble, which can reward players for knowledge of obscure short words. The game is also very accessible for non-gamers, and has a very broad appeal. It also works outstandingly as a solitaire challenge. In BuyWord, Sid Sackson has produced a word game that deserves to be a modern classic among word games. - EndersGame @ BGG",5.0,A clever and classic word game with an economic element,1327276800,"01 23, 2012",Toys_and_Games,1.0

Guck ""FujiToast""","[0, 0]","I started playing this game thanks to the new Pocket Ticket to Ride on iPhone and iPod Touch and now I'm hooked. It only took a week for me to decide I needed the actual board game version of this as well. I have to admit that though the rules are VERY simple, when you try explain them to someone who's never played, they will often kinda look at you blanky, only understanding a part of what you're telling them. But all it takes is one play through for everybody to understand. And usually they say, ""That was cool! Lets play again now that I understand it better!"" The game is great for basically elementary ages and up, you can not be too old for this one. The game is a bit on the expensive side though it does seem to be cheaper on amazon then everywhere else, including a certain well known auction site. Though the game quality and organization inside the box is well thought through. The only thing that is annoying is the size of the cards. They are significantly smaller than standard playing cards making the handling and shuffling a little difficult. Though that can be fixed by purchasing the 1910 expansion pack which includes full size cards, but obviously that's another $15-$20 purchase. So is the game fun and addicting? You bet it is. Is it too expensive? Well yeah, kinda, but if you have some friends and family that really enjoy board games, then I think it's worth it. It's about the same price as taking a family of four out to the movies anyway.If you're on the fence about purchasing this game and you own an iOS device, I've got some simple advice for you. Buy the $1 dollar app and give it a try, You'll know within a few game plays if this one is for you. And my bet is it probably is.Oh and my other small gripe is the placement of Duluth. I understand that Duluth was a large trade city at the time of the railroad boom but they put it in the place of Minneapolis/St. Paul. They really should've either moved Duluth up to Superior (It's correct location) or changed the name on the board to St. Paul. It's a little thing, but it's glaringly obvious to us Minnesotans. ;)",5.0,Family Friendly Fun,1330992000,"03 6, 2012",Toys_and_Games,1.0

Depending on how many people are playing, and how quickly they take their turns, this game can take anywhere between thirty minutes and two hours.  The rules are simple, and while experienced players have an advantage against beginners, people can get up to speed after a few turns of their first game.  Strategies for winning consistently can be gained after only one or two games.There are many versions and expansions for this game, all of which are fun and interesting and worth looking at to see which best suits your group of players.  But, this is the most basic form of the game and has the most straight-forward set of rules:- You have &#34;tickets&#34; telling you which cities your trains need to connect in order to earn points, if at the end of the game, the connection isn't completed, you get a negative point value for that &#34;ticket&#34;.- You have colored &#34;train car&#34; cards, which you combine to build connections between cities.  If a connection is colored, you need that color to make the connection and if it is grey, then you can use any one color to make the connection.- On each turn, you can either: build a connection between two cities; select a new &#34;ticket&#34;; draw two &#34;train car&#34; cards from 5 visible possibilities or from the face down deck.- There are &#34;locomotive train car&#34; cards, which are wild, but are more expensive to draw from the visible cards (only get one).- The longer the set of train cars used to make a connection, the more points you earn (1=1, 2=2, 3=4, 4=7, etc.)- Whoever has the longest connection at the end, by train car length, gets additional points.The expansion versions add other possibilities, depending on the map (tunnels that can take more than one card to complete; ferries that require at least one locomotive; etc.).  Some of the maps/expansions are better suited to more players and others are limited to just two or three players.  You can probably find a version of this game that is best suited for your group, but this basic version is a good version to start with.I would also highly recommend the PC or mobile version of this game, which can provide access to many of the maps and give you an idea as to which version of the game you would prefer, without buying all of them.Overall, this is one of the best board games out there, well suited to beginning players or more advanced board gamers.",5.0,One of the best board games around,1399420800,"05 7, 2014",Toys_and_Games,1.0

The strategy is not too tricky, but challenging enough to hold your interest.  Basically, you either collect or play train cards on your turn.  You need to have the same number and color to play on a route, and then you connect your routes to match the bonus on your ticket.  The score for routes increases by the number of train cards needed, from 1 point for 1 to 15 points for 6.  My only complaint is that there are a few tickets that might be weighted a little high and lucking into one of these on the initial draw gives a slight advantage.  You get a higher bonus to connect farther apart cities, but some of these have longer routes between them which give you a bonus already.

TtR America is really a game where you are searching for the best path and trying to take it before your competitors do. In addition it requires you to find a path and on some level manage your resources (cards). When we first got this game my friends and I played it incessantly.The one problem with this game is that a very strong strategy for winning also makes it a lot less fun to play. One of my friends who plays it always goes for the finish all the 6 length train strategy which considerably shortens the game and often does not give the other players enough time to complete their destinations before the game ends.

I was impressed with how involved yet laid back the gameplay is.  This is a quietly strategic game that will challenge you to make the right moves at the right time.  The concept is to travel to and from specific destinations, but the key is that no one is aware of where you are going or where you are starting from and the routes to each destination can vary depending on the cards you have in your hand.  You can select multiple routes, which allows you to travel to different destinations at the same time, and while you do get points (visible points) for each route to lay down, you get extra points tallied at the end of the game for each ticket you complete, and because you keep your tickets hidden from other players, no one is aware of how many you have completed and how many points each of your tickets is worth.  In other words, when we played this the other night I was in last place on the board and wound up winning by over 70 points because I had completed far more tickets than anyone else!

The beauty of games like this and Settlers of Catan or Carcassonne is that there is a big social element. You are not only rolling the dice and making a move based on that. Although honestly this game has the players moves having less of an effect on others. You essentially either take paths, swap cards, or draw cards.

We now enjoy looking for and trying out new and interesting boardgame options.One of our treasured finds is ""Ticket to Ride.""  It is no mystery to board game enthusiasts that this is a great game, but just in case you don't run in those circles or visit those web sites, here's the scoop on this game.What you should know about this game if you are considering it:1) It can accommodate up to 5 players.2) The game works best for players aged 10 and up (though the box says 8 and up).  Our 9-yr-old was able to pick up on this game, but it takes a bit longer to play than her gaming attention span is at the moment, and she likes to play games.3) This game may take up to an hour to play, though quicker play by experienced players can cut that time in half.In this game players are competing rail barons in the year 1900.  At the start of the game each player draws three destination cards that indicate the beginning and ending cities of a RR line (e.g., Denver to New Orleans).  Players choose to keep at least two of those destination cards and they collect colored RR car cards that they can trade in to claim segments of RR lines needed to connect cities on their destination cards.  Players earn points for each RR segment they complete, for completion of the RR indicated on destination cards, and for completing the longest continuous RR line.As as you play you need to beware that as you are working to complete a RR line you could be blocked either accidentally or on purpose (depending on the personalities of your competitors) when another player builds on a RR segment you need.  If that happens, that just means that you need to find an alternative way to get to complete the RR line between your destinations.It takes good judgement to decide when and where to build your RR segments, as well as when to select additional destination cards.Just so you know, on a player's turn they can either collect up to two colored RR car cards, build a RR segment, or draw new destination cards.This is a fun game that can be enjoyable for tweenaged children and grown-ups alike.Since there are way more destination cards included with the game than can be built during any one game, and since the shuffling of those cards, as well as the large number of colored RR car cards is large, the game is never the same twice.Another perk of this game, in addition to it's overal enjoyability is the fact that as you play you can learn some geography of North America (some Canadian cities are also included).Fun and educational.When you are ready to move beyond games like ""Candyland"", ""The Game of Life"", etc., try this one out.Also, just in case you didn't know, there are also other versions of ""Ticket to Ride"" for Europe, Germany, and Switzerland (some of which are stand-alone games, and some of which are expansion games).In any case, this particular game is a solid 5-star option, easily played (once you get through your first few games).I hope this was helpful.",5.0,"Family time, geography, and fun.",1232150400,"01 17, 2009",Toys_and_Games,1.0

I grew up on bad board games, or overplayed ones like Risk, so I was skeptical at first. My wife and I got really into it after the first time. This is a fairly simple game; collect matching color cards and try and get the largest individual sections, most routes, or longest route, in any combination you can. This game is not nearly as fun with only 2 people as you will likely never have a route fully broken; it is much easier to get to your destinations and to get all your routes to connect. The game really shines (and frustrates!) with 4 or 5 people. The rules and play of this truly are simple and there are not a large number of strategies with this original version. Supposedly there are expansions for different countries and for different rules. The randomness of the cards really prevents many long term strategies from working so you have to change this up often.Cons - Well like I said I played this at a friends. His version had full sized cards like a normal set of playing cards. I bought mine at Barnes and Noble and for whatever reason, all the cards in my set are about half sized, like 2 x 3 inches. The printing on them is not as crisp and bright. The smaller size makes shuffling them a major pain. Otherwise the trains, the main board, and everything else is as it should be. In some ways the smaller cards makes playing the game easier to organize, but the quality of the printing is not as good.Just curious, who has the bigger or smaller cards and which do they like better? I am thinking of calling the company and complaining because after playing on the big cards, the small ones really suck",4.0,A nice simple game thats fun at any age,1388188800,"12 28, 2013",Toys_and_Games,1.0

The main problem with the base set is that whoever builds the big northern routes usually wins, exacerbated by the awarding of a ""longest route"" ticket worth bonus points. The 1910 expansion offers you the choice of eliminating the longest route bonus and awarding a ""most routes completed"" bonus instead, or using both of them, or neither. That helps tailor the win condition to best suit the group.However, I still prefer theTicket to Ride Europewith theDays of Wonder Ticket to Ride 1912 Expansionbecause of it provides more interesting challenges (ferries and tunnels) and adds stations players can use to get around being cut off in completing their routes. These stations can easily be used in USA or other versions. Europe still has the ""longest route"" bonus points award but this is easier to get for everyone because if you have to use a station to complete a route ticket, it no longer counts toward your getting the longest route award.Another excellent option over the USA version is theDays of Wonder Ticket To Ride - Marklin(Germany) version that adds passengers you can use to score crazy bonus points that add a whole new strategy to the game; unlike the stations in Europe, however, the passenger mechanic is not easily integrated into other editions. Another nice thing about Marklin is that it offers the most balanced map with a near equal distribution of long and short routes which are split up on the left and right sides of the vertical map. With Marklin, completing a ton of short routes is just as viable a win strategy as long routes in the USA base sets.Both Europe and Marklin also split your initial ticket allotment into long (blue-backed) and short (brown-backed) routes; you get to choose how many of each you want to do--unlike the USA base set, which is totally random in its ticket distribution (long routes are harder to complete but offer more bonus points to win than short routes).I also enjoy theTicket to Ride Switzerland Map ExpansionandDays of Wonder Ticket to Ride: Nordic Countries Board Game. Both Switzerland and Nordic Countries are designed for only 2-3 players, unlike the usual 2-5) so they are great options for smaller groups. They also offer the two most challenging maps.  Unfortunately, Switzerland is out-of-print and online sellers are charging a fortune for it.  You can play it and the USA and Europe versions online, however, for a much more reasonable cost (live opponents or vs. the computer).  I've played the online version almost 1,000 times since August 2010 but I still love playing the board games.  They are my favorite board games of all time!One thing to watch out for, in my opinion, is that the original USA edition is initially fun but that fun can turn to frustration once you realize the easiest way to win is to just build the long northern routes. That problem is corrected with the 1910 Expansion by providing new route tickets, a new way to score bonus points, and two variants: Big Cities and USA Mega-Game -- the Mega-Game uses everything in the expansion set and is my favorite way to play Ticket To Ride: USA). However, I still prefer the maps and additional challenges (like building ferries and tunnels) that are provided by the Europe and Marklin editions.No matter which version you pick, if you know how to play one, the others are easy to pick up, and the rules of all editions are fast and easy to learn in about 5 minutes.Ticket To Ride is, in my opinion, the best light strategy (or ""gateway"") game on the market to bring family and friends together.  Actual game time may vary depending on the number of players, their familiarity with the maps and rules, and how quickly they can strategize and complete their turn (most turns are finished in a minute or less but some could last up to 5, especially when choosing additional route tickets). I'd say every version of Ticket To Ride (even with expansions) takes about 60 minutes on average but a game could last anywhere from 30-120 minutes (the difference between having 2 players vs. 4-5, for example, and/or if some newbie players need rules or strategy help, or are just really bad at making decisions and revising their strategy on the fly).",4.0,"The Europe, Marklin, and Nordic Editions are superior but the original is still a great game",1281571200,"08 12, 2010",Toys_and_Games,1.0

You can play five, but the gameplay gets a little long, and your desired paths are more easily clogged up.We LOVE this game!  It's well made, with an oversize game board map of U.S. and Canada.  You get plastic trains in five colors, wagon cards (used to claim your routes), and secret destination tickets which score you bonus points.The game has subtle intricacies, and you'll have fun developing your own strategies.  You get points by claiming routes between cities.  Points are somewhat exponential--a two-wagon route is worth two points while a six-wagon route lands you 15 points.You also score with destination tickets.  Complete your destinations and earn the points (ranging from four points to 21 for a cross-country route). But, if you don't connect the two cities on your destination ticket, those points are DEDUCTED from your score! Players reveal their destination tickets at the end of the game.  You can also try to foil your opponents by claiming routes that interfere with where you think they are trying to go.The game maker, Days of Wonder, provides a lively online gaming community.  You get an online code with your purchase, so you can play this fun game (and other Days games) online whenever you want.  This is an awesome feature we use almost daily.

Our other two sons (6 yr old twins) placed the trains on the board and followed along so they could play next time.  We had a blast.  It didn't take long to learn and has both skill and luck in picking the right cards.  I think 8 is the best starting age for this game as our 8 year old had no trouble picking it up, but our six year old would've had difficulty.  They may have picked up most concepts, but still will need assistance.  We also decided to add up all the points at the end instead of scoring as we went along because they were all so excited they kept knocking the scoring pieces off the edge of the board.  (they suggest this in case you want to double check in the end).  I HIGHLY suggest this game to all.  We all loved it and had a good time.  As a family of six (us and four boys) it was our first family game experience that went without crying, frustration and kept us glued to our seats.  Could be that our boys are finally getting older and can sit through a game, but we've tried many that says 8 and up and are either too difficult or too easy that don't have the adults having fun.  This one easily keeps all entertained.  I am definitely going to look into the other games they offer.  Before we started I (mom) read through all the instructions and then taught everyone how to play.  I set up the board and instructed everyone as we went along. It only took about two times around the board for everyone to catch on to all the rules.  We had such a good time that I decided to jump on and write a review.  Enjoy!",5.0,Great Family Fun Game.

Then I discovered the Trans Europa board game and it's much better.Ticket to Ride has a lot of pieces that are pretty nicely made.  And the game was fun in the beginning... but eventually, after 10 games or so, I realized many people adopt the same strategy of &#34;hoard cards.  Make all your moves at once to win.&#34;  After you realize that... it's not so amazing any more.If you like/love Ticket to Ride, I highly recommend the Trans Europa board game.  The concept is the same, building tracks to connect cities, but it has fewer pieces, the rules are simple enough to play with a 6-year-old, and it's waaaay more fun.  When someone wins in Trans Europa, everyone all goes &#34;ooooh!! I was *soooo* close to winning!&#34;.  Because the rules to Trans Europa pretty-much mean the games will always be close at the end.  Plus, the games are shorter, so you can play a couple times and get that fun &#34;sooo close&#34; feeling again and again.Ticket to Ride is good.  Trans Europa is Better.

We have played Last Night on Earth, Carcassonne, Lost Cities, Pandemic, Mr. Jack, and assorted other two-player games. My husband got this for his birthday and we were really pleased with it, right out of the box. The board itself is very nicely constructed. There are no bumps or lumps, and it lays completely flat (our Lost Cities board has an edge that sticks up, and it can get annoying.) The trains are cute and well-constructed. You pick your destinations and then get started laying out the trains! The goal is to get trains to the destinations on your cards, as well as to have the longest train ride. My husband and I sometimes play it differently and have a goal to have as many trains on the board as possible. We just purchased the 1910 expansion, which gives you bigger cards. This is important. The cards in the original version are very, very small - apparently to look like old school train tickets. I just find it slightly annoying because you end up with so many tiny cards. It isn't annoying enough to take a star off the rating, though. Just annoying enough to buy a $13 (on Amazon) expansion!

To find such a game I visited the boardgame geek forums and found that for beginners of so-called serious board games, Ticket to Ride was the way to go.Pros:1. Easy to learn. My wife and I have not played many board games, but we picked up the basics of Ticket to Ride in under ten minutes.2. High quality product. The map is made of firm cardboard. The illustrations are artistic and fit the theme of the game. The trains themselves are solid plastic.3. Loads of replay value. There are different strategies out there, and depending on the destination tickets you receive, you have to adapt how you play that particular game. You can keep going back to the tickets to get the ones you prefer, but you always have to keep at least one card, so there is a bit of luck involved.4. Takes less than an hour. We have young children and will often play this game after the kids go to sleep. The game time length is perfect. We can finish an entire game and still be in bed early enough.We haven't played outside of just two people, but we can't wait to get our friends and family in on it.Con1. Only one con. The train and destination cards are rather small, which makes shuffling difficult. We plan to invest in the 1910 expansion, which should quell that complaint.

Smaller cards are not only more difficult to handle, but also to shuffle.

Gameplay is fast, simple enough that all but the youngest children can grasp it within a few minutes, and yet deep enough that even serious boardgamers will find it very enjoyable.  It even includes spare pieces and a number count (so if you lose certain pieces you can find a substitute and still have the required number.)  Numerous expansions can keep the game fresh for years to come.The only minor quibble is the huge size of the card deck, along with the decision to use 1/4 scale cards.  The tiny size can make dealing with a typical hand a bit awkward.  A full-size deck might add to the price, but would probably be worth it.

The gameplay is fairly simple and turns go smoothly...that is...all you're doing is either drawing to match like colors or placing like colors on the board to make connections. You aren't managing stocks or trying to figure out if the D-20 you rolled entitles you to a critical hit because someone else played an interrupt card. For this reason, everyone in the house (with the exception of the person who hates board games) enjoys playing this game. The thirteen year old says that this is her favorite game to play, because it is ""fun."" The ten-year old enjoys the whole ""train theme"" and making connections.As for me, I enjoy it because of the strategy element.  If I see one of the kids trying to make an obvious connection between two distant cities, for example, I may decide to make my own connections to block them. Players can't make connections over someone else's, meaning they have to make detours if they really wished to continue to make their original connection. Some city routes have dual connections to combat this. I enjoy the strategy of placing connections based on what my ticket cards require me to do without making it too obvious. Rather than form a long chain of trains, I'll place a connection here and a connection there so that my route isn't obvious until it is almost complete. By then, it's usually too late for anyone to block me.I highly recommend you give this a try, especially if you are looking for something new to play on family game night.",5.0,Ticket to Ride Review by Dad's Gaming Addiction,1381104000,"10 7, 2013",Toys_and_Games,1.0

If you don't want to read this, skip this paragraph. Until recently (~6 months ago), both of us had only been exposed to games like Monopoly, Uno, Yahtzee, Risk, etc...the typical Milton Bradley/Hasbro ""family game night"" run-of-the-mill games. We had a mutual like of Risk, but the other games were sort of ""meh"" to us. However, when we recently ""cut the cord"" and canceled our cable subscription due to a crappy cable provider, I did some research on other ways to spend better, higher-quality time together, and stumbled across a couple of Euro-style games (Pandemic and Forbidden Island) that we acquired. We were both hooked. Since then, we have added a handful of other games to the collection that we play semi-regularly.Ticket to Ride is currently our main game/addiction. The game mechanics are simple enough that you don't have to heavily to play, but there's enough strategy involved to keep things interesting. You can play either laid-back or cutthroat, conservatively or aggressively, etc. The number of pieces given to each player is just the right amount, too - you might find that sabotaging your opponent would cost you an opportunity to finish a destination ticket of your own, or that you don't have enough pieces to claim all of the destination tickets that you draw.This game takes approximately 30 minutes to play (great if you've got a busy schedule and can only spare 30-45 minutes), but it's addictive enough that we sometimes spend several hours playing it. The replay value is high, as is the ""curse you, I want a rematch!"" factor.

This German-made game beats familiar games like Monopoly and Risk hands-down.OBJECTEach player must complete a series of rail lines spanning cities based upon destination cards drawn at the beginning (and throughout) the game. Each destination carries points related to the length of the line, so a New York to Los Angeles line would score more points than Chicago to Boston. Incomplete destinations count against players at the end of the game, so completing them, even through circuitous routes is a must. The exciting part of the game comes from not knowing who is completing his or her lines, plus the ability to overlap lines, stymieing other players.Game play takes between 30 and 90 minutes depending on the number of players and the speed at which they make decisions.GAME PIECESHigh quality throughout, the game includes:- A fold-out board of the United States and southern Canada, plus a scoring track around the edge. The cities on the board connect through colored track lines, each line between one and six units in length.- A set of destination cards showing lines that must be completed.- Five sets of forty-five train pieces. Each player takes one same-color set of trains.- A set of colored train cards that correspond to the colored lines that connect cities.- Scoring markers that correspond to a player's train color.PLAYEach player is dealt three destination cards in the beginning and must keep at least two. These form the basis for their lines. They also receive four train cards. To claim a line, players must create sets of the same color and number of train cards as the line connecting two cities. (The color of the lines has nothing to do with the player's train color, but the cards they have in hand.)Each player, in turn, can perform one of three actions:1. Draw two train cards per turn from either the set of five placed up for all players to see, or blind from the train card deck. (One card if one of the showing wild cards is chosen.)2. Play a set of matching train card colors to claim a line between two cities.3. Get dealt a new set of three destination cards, keeping at least one.Players score points when they claim a line of track connecting two cities, the length of the track yielding proportionately higher scores. Scoring markers are moved around the 100-point scoring guide on the board perimeter.When one player has laid all his or her train pieces, the other players get one last turn. Players then reveal their destination cards and add (or subtract, for incomplete lines) to their total. The longest continuous length of claimed track scores additional points, too. Highest point total wins.REVIEWPros:A gorgeous, well-made game that's easy on the eyes, Ticket to Ride combines simple rules and nail-biting game play with a significant level of strategy. You can't ask for more in a board game.All ages will love this game. Even children as young as six can play since the rules are simple.Will please folks sick of the usual board games everyone has.Game play is short enough to allow multiple sessions of play.The manufacturer has other games in the Ticket to Ride series that work off the same basic gaming system, though with differing degrees of skill (through additional rules and trickier city layouts). Expansion kits exist, too, so players familiar with the game can get an additional kick out of their existing set. Lastly, an online, multi-player, interactive version of the game can be played through the manufacturer's Web site.Cons:The manufacturer lists a game session as lasting 30-60 minutes. We've found it closer to 45-90 minutes.Ticket to Ride has been around since 2004 and is beginning to show some age when compared against newer European-style board games. In addition, other games in the Ticket to Ride series eclipse the base game (though some expansions require the base game for play). For a game that plays similarly to Ticket to Ride but adds more depth of play, consider Ticket to Ride designer Alan Moon's Airlines Europe.OVERALLAs someone who loves games, I found Ticket to Ride to be a great introduction to European-style board games. Nothing disappoints. Everyone who plays the game wants to know where to get a copy. Ticket to Ride has won numerous Game of the Year honors around the world, and it's easy to see why. Absolutely worthy of its stars.UPDATE: For enhanced play, consider the 1910 expansion. It includes larger, easier-to-read cards, additional destinations, and more winning conditions. It makes a four-star game into five!",4.0,"Outstanding strategy game that's easy to learn, tough to master",1167696000,"01 2, 2007",Toys_and_Games,1.0

The rules are simple & quality of the game pieces is very high.Despite its recommendation of 8 yrs+, my 6-yr (train buff) son loves it.  If you are trying to decide:  The child needs limited reading skills, i.e., to read a city name on a card and associate with the name on the map (you can help them and the game still can be fun).This is the first adult-type game I can play with my son.  The 1st few games we played with open cards and I had to help him, but he soon learned enough to make his own decisions.  Game play is fast and we often play 2 games in a row.Although simple to play, there is much strategy to the game. My son & I continue to hone our skills (this keeps the game interesting, even for me).  The game actually has an element of excitement when your near the end and wonder whether you'll be able to complete all your routes.  We sometimes play day after day w/o getting bored.As a parent, another nice thing about the game is you can unobtrusively let your child win without them knowing you did so (it's not like most kid's games that are purely based on chance and are therefore are ""hard to lose."")The main educational element is that game play requires thinking about the future and visualizing how to route your trains (how many games that a 6 yr old can play require such thinking?).  It also teaches basic US/Southern Canada geography. The only downside is that game requires much card shuffling.

The premise is simple, fulfill your route cards by connecting trains from once destination city to the next.  The strategy all boils down to when do you start laying tracks and potentially reveal your goal, vs. how long do you hold back and keep accumulating cards to amass your avalanche of trains.  This game is very easy to learn to play for veteran gamers and novices alike.If you are still on the edge, check out the newly updated and released version by days of Wonder for your Ipad.  With the new retina display the publisher has used the same collateral used for their print runs on the electronic version, creating a very high fidelity experience to the actual board game.

In Ticket to Ride, you play one of five different friends who are obsessed with  Phileas Fogg, the man who went around the world in 80 days.  Based on Fogg's story, the players make a one million dollar bet to see who can make it to the most cities in seven days.  In the game, players can do one of three different things on their turn to travel across America:  collect tickets, collect routes, or spend tickets to travel.  When a player collects tickets, they draw one or two tickets.  These tickets can be one of five revealed tickets or from the draw pile.  If a player draws a wild card from the revealed tickets that is the only ticket they can draw that turn.  When a player collects routes, they draw three routes and must keep one.  Routes are worth positive points if a player has connected the cities on the card at the end of the game, but, the card could be worth negative points if the player does not complete the route.  The last action a player can do is spending tickets to place trains on the board.  To place trains on a path on the board, a player must spend enough tickets of the same color as the path.  Some paths are gray and allow the player to spend any color ticket as long as they spend the same color tickets.  Each time a player places trains on the board, they earn points based on how long the path is.  Play continues until one player has two or less trains in reserve.  Then all players get one last turn, and then the game is over.  After counting points from route cards the player with the most points wins!Theme-I'll be honest.  I've played this game a lot, but, I didn't read the story until I finally bought the game.  The story reinforces the theme decently and helps makes the title ""Ticket to Ride"" make sense.  Some of the mechanics don't quite reinforce the theme as once you have a route it doesn't leave the board.  Do you get to keep the tickets you have for that route in the game?  Do you get to keep riding the trains for free?  Why can't other players ride the same train as me?  It's not perfect, but I do feel like I'm busy trying to make it across America as fast as I can. 3.5/5Mechanics-Ticket to Ride has some of the slickest mechanics out there.  My simple summary above is almost all the rules you need to play the game.  The game is quick, fun, and family friendly for almost all ages.  Even though the game doesn't have the insane depth of some other games, a surprising amount of strategy emerges in this game.  Since goals are secrete, you never know when your best laid plans will go up in smoke.  That tension is amazing for a simple game. 5/5Instructions-The instructions are four pages.  Not four pages front and back, two pages front and back.  Since the rules are not complex, the rules don't need an epic to teach the players.  I do like the art and pictures that help to teach how to play.  Brevity is the height of wit with these rules. 5/5Execution-The box is nice and hardy.  The path indicators are cute plastic trains that are a nice addition to the game.  The board has a nice layout and is easy to read.  AND, I know the Days of Wonder LOVES me since the game comes with plastic bags for each player's components.  I absolutely love when a company does that! 5/5Summary-I love this game.  It's quick, family friendly, and always good to see making it to the table.  The theme is slightly off, but the mechanics, instructions, and execution of the game make up for that hands down.  Really worth trying if you get the chance. 92.5%",5.0,Ring Side Report- Board Game Review of Ticket to Ride,1401148800,"05 27, 2014",Toys_and_Games,1.0

We are trying to do it more for the kids (10 and 8) but most games are too kid oriented to hold an adults attention or too difficult for the kids to enjoy.

It is challenging enough if you want to apply a lot of strategy but it is simple enough in theory that it need not be difficult at all. What really impressed me is the quality of the game. So many of the games we have purchased have cheaply made boards, all the pieces in cellophane bag that can not be reused and thrown in the empty box, etc. This came with a huge board of great quality, thick game cards printed on a decent stock  rather than thin paper, nice pieces and I love the way the inside plastic organizer for the pieces has well thought out indentions that makes storing the pieces securely possible while also making it possible for you to get ahold of the pieces easily.I have a feeling this is going to be a family favorite for awhile.

We kind of developed our own rules for making it a two player game (we only take 10 destination cards instead of the whole pile).  Otherwise our scores were in the negative.We have played it probably a dozen times and it makes more and more sense the more you play it.

The suggested age is 8+ and the kids are only 7 so we played a simplified version but the rules are so basic, they make that really easy to do.Basically we focused on completing and connecting routes and didn't worry about the route cards. Then we called a halt the first time someone ran out of cards to keep the game length short enough.The rules are brilliantly simple. I read them once, the boys grasped them. Strategy took a little longer to sink in (which is why I went with the simplified rules), but before the game was offer they had caught on to the importance of longer routes and connecting them together.This simplicity is what makes ideal as a family game. It's comparatively quick by board game standards (even without modified rules), people can easily come from last place and jump straight into the lead, and there's very little explaining or rule checking required.It's also nicely constructed.

The basic premise of the game allows the player to earn points by completing connected train routes. I compare it to Monopoly in that you have to plan which route will work best with the amount of trains you have vs. which properties will you buy based on the amount of money you have. They both involve strategy, but Ticket to Ride will never turn into a 'marathon' game as eventually the players will run out of trains quicker than Monopoly players would lose their money. So, to recap - it's a fast-paced strategic game that will definitely keep you entertained, especially if you have a fondness for travel.At this point, my favorite is the original US version as it takes longer to build the routes and it requires more thought out approaches. I would highly recommend the add-on purchase of the 1910 cards to enhance game play. Without the purchase of these cards, I have to say the only negative was the mini-size cards that came with this version of the game.

She is what some would call a &#34;reluctant gamer&#34; whereas I am an avid gamer, so I have be careful about what games I introduce her to. She prefers games that rely at least a little on luck (i.e., not all strategy) and aren't too complex (i.e., where you can learn/remember the mechanic after a game or two), whereas I love strategy and complexity but don't mind a little luck. We also like games you can finish in a single session (or games you can play multiple times in a single session).TTR is fun to play and easy to learn (in fact, the USA version is the simplest of the TTR franchise). The 1910 expansion is a must (updates some old components, and adds some new ones that are really worthwhile). The luck component is based on the train cards and destination tickets you randomly draw. The strategy component is based on what routes you try to complete, some of the card choices you make (they do not always have to be random), etc.We liked the game so much that I eventually bought all four of the map collections (Asia, India & Switzerland, Africa, & Neederlands).  We don't own but have also played Nordic Countries, too.The only reasons I'm giving it 4 rather than 5 stars are (1) the 1910 expansion is so essential that it really should have been included in the base game, and (2) once you've played this version a few times this particular map will start to feel a little simple.  Knowing what I know now I probably would have started with the Europe map and 1912 expansion instead (a little more to it at first, but lots more ways to grow into the game). But, this is still a great way to learn the game, and if you happen to be from the U.S. it will be a little easier to find the cities since you'll know where everything is.",4.0,TTR U.S.A. is the way to go if you want the least complex version of the game,1399766400,"05 11, 2014",Toys_and_Games,1.0

I won't bother going into specifics on gameplay, as that can be found elsewhere; suffice to say that it is a lot of fun, and pretty consistently takes about an hour to complete a game (with normal family interruptions - serious players could finish in 45 minutes or so). What I will say is that it's an incredibly well-produced game. The quality of the materials is very high: the artwork is fantastic, it has great pieces, even the instruction manual is exceptionally well done.Days of Wonder has put a lot of thought into every aspect of the production of their games. The possible exception with Ticket to Ride USA is its cards. Their small format can be frustrating for someone with above-average-sized hands. For all players, but especially those, I recommend getting the 1910 Expansion, which includes a replacement deck in standard playing card format.For those who have heard about this game, or played it once, and would like to get their own copy, I would make the following recommendation: if you have children age 12 or under, go ahead and get Ticket to Ride. For older players, I would recommend Ticket to Ride: Europe, or, if you're even more adventurous, M&auml;rklin, Switzerland, or Nordic Countries. These editions offer varying levels of complexity that will likely offer more long-term replay value to older players.",5.0,"Great Game, Good Introduction to the Ticket to Ride Series",1378684800,"09 9, 2013",Toys_and_Games,1.0

It's quick to learn, fun to play (even with only two players), and has infinite replay value.

It works well with only two players, so is one of few that is enjoyable for my husband and I to play by ourselves, but will also be good to play as our children get older and can join our games. The game can work for up to 5 players, but in practice, I have found that the board becomes very crowded with 5 and the game is much more cutthroat at that point.The gameplay is extremely simple. Your goal: use your train pieces to make travel routes between destination cities. You start each game with three potential destination cards (drawn from a deck) and MUST choose two to begin.Each turn, you can choose to do one of three things:(1) Draw cards (used to make railroads)(2) Make a railroad (by spending the appropriate number of cards) to connect your destinationsOR (3) Choose additional destination card(s).Each completed destination card awards points. Failing to complete a destination card removes points. Each completed railroad section awards points (based on the length of the railroad). At the end of the game, the player with the longest continuous railway is awarded bonus points. And of course, the player with the most points wins.Fairly simple rules. The strategy comes in balancing the different risks. Should I go ahead and claim the railroad I need now, or should I get the cards that I will need for the next section? If I place a railroad, will others guess where I am attempting to go and block me from proceeding? Should I attempt to get additional destination cards to increase my point total, or should I try to keep others from completing their destinations?People who enjoyCarcassonne Basic Gameand theThe Settlers of Catanseries will probably like this game as well.",5.0,Interesting new board game,1369699200,"05 28, 2013",Toys_and_Games,1.0

Ticket to Ride can be completed I well under two hours if you keep the game moving.  It is easy to teach new players and there are always several moments of celebration or frustration during the game adding to its competitiveness.Another thing we like about this game is that until the very end when points are actually counted up, there is some doubt as to who is actually winning.  I suppose Type A players will spend time counting others scores, but usually players have to count on their own strategies. This is a good family game and it is a good game to play among friends.

After a month or so, we bought this version, the original Ticket to Ride of U.S. and Southern Canada.  It is less complicated and has smaller cards...both features that I like very much.  My advice is to buy this version first to see what it's all about and work your way up to the European version.  We're going to buy the Scandinavian version to see what it's all about.  The thing that pleases me most about these games is that you are in competition with yourself.  Decisions you make have definite impact on your outcome.  I truly have no interest in ""winning"" the game...I just want to be able to complete the routes that I choose.  Even the ""heavy"" competitors in our group have calmed down and approach the game with less desire to ""beat everybody"".  Even though our group started with the European version, we are all very taken with the simpler U.S. version and play both versions equally...depending on our fatigue factor.

It is a pretty easy game to learn but changes enough between each game to keep us coming back and playing again.

The game will start slow, but the choice of one of three actions you can do can make turns happen quickly once everyone understands the basic rules.As you get better at the game you find that there several different methods you can use to win, such as picking up extra trips, having the longest continuous train(or route). Hiding where you want to go, or trying to create the longing train from several directions at once.With all the pieces in the game (each player starts with 45 train pieces) there is the possibility that you may loose some of the them. Its all ok as long as everyone starts with the same number of train elements.  You can modify the game to make it go faster by having less pieces be used and can even do a team type game where you split a color between two team mates.The counter board for the score that goes around the table is clever and works very well.

We wanted something different aside from the various iterations of Uno, Monopoly, Sorry or the other 'staples' of American gaming that fill the shelves at Walmart/Target. So, after doing some research I decided that we'd grab Ticket to Ride since it reviewed so well here on Amazon. I believe it was the twelfth most popular purchase in the board games category when I selected it.What drew me to this game? First of all the reviews, as I mention above. Some reviews go all the way into game play and others, like this one, just talk about what made it great for our family. The next thing was easily the look and feel of the game. It has a very rich appearance in terms of how the playing surface, playing materials all were made to look and how they felt in your hand. The playing surface is beautifully done and is made from nice, thick stock. The train pieces themselves are plastic and seem to be in the middle of the road in terms of quality. Not cheap, but not expensive to make by any stretch of the imagination. The playing cards, while somewhat small (see comment below), are beautifully drawn and have nice detail. The instructions were also easy to read and comprehend, providing examples and ideas about game play.Upon opening the box my only disappointment is with the size of the cards used for the game. I think they are too small and I'm constantly afraid I'm going to lose one. They feel needlessly small and I don't think it was anything more than a cost-cutting move to make them this size, they are about a third the size of the average playing card. But really, this is a trivial complaint.It took my family only one session to figure out the rules and play a successful round. The rules are simple and the ways to win are varied. You can go for volume and lay down as many tracks as you can or you can try to win by trying to complete all the destination cards you can. Either way, the game is fun and engaging. I'm glad we added this game to our collection as it's perfect for us to play and bring in the occasional couple of guests to the fun as well. I'll look into the expansions, but for now this game hits a sweet spot for us in terms of time to play, strategy involved to win and ease of play.",5.0,Great addition for my family,1308528000,"06 20, 2011",Toys_and_Games,1.0

I usually play with the 1910 rules substitution that the person with the most tickets completed gets 15 points instead of the one with the longest track, because it feels more thematic.  I don't have 1910, so it's just a house rule to my base set.Really, the game isn't that difficult to grasp and the strategy runs pretty deep.  The longer you can wait before you do something the better off you are, but at the same time the longer you wait the more likely someone else is to do it before you.  Sometimes the game can feel a bit slow when everyone spends turn after turn drawing cards, but on the whole it seems to go pretty fast most of the time.It is a bit frustrating when you need one specific card and you keep drawing over and over and never get it, but otherwise it is pretty rewarding to see how the stuff you are doing is directly accomplishing your goals as you go along.  Overall, luck doesn't have that big of an impact on the game and that makes it a pretty good game for serious game players.Serious game players aren't going to really care what the theme is, but the less serious game players do care and particularly the younger ones and I think the train theme can appeal to a lot of those sorts of players, so I would say that TTR makes for a pretty good mixed company sort of game or for a family to all play together.The most important things you want from a game, though, are going to be 1) doesn't drag on forever, 2) people don't hate each other after the game, and 3) that people don't feel their fates are completely dependent on luck.  I think that TTR does a pretty good job of avoiding all of those pitfalls.",5.0,"Arrived quickly, no damage, great game",1387756800,"12 23, 2013",Toys_and_Games,1.0

A cousin of mine had recommended that we try Ticket to Ride, as she had heard about all the awards and high reviews it has gotten. I must say that we are happy with our purchase. It isn't hard to learn and has a simple, but fun and strategic concept. You try to complete train routes by building lines from city to city, and get extra points for completing destination cards. The fun and strategy elements come from the fact that you don't know where anyone else is trying to get to, so you have to try to guess their moves while focusing on your own, and can even try to sabotage their routes from time to time. They also make a great ipad app for playing this on the go, which I would strongly recommend.

I've introduced several people to this game, including family members that don't like board games, and everyone has loved it. The game goes by quickly, with a full session taking about 45-60 minutes. Each player's turn goes by quickly as well, averaging about 10 seconds for two of the normal actions (drawing train cards or claiming a route), and maybe 1 minute for the other action (choosing new destination cards-- a somewhat uncommon event), so you don't end up in a situation when each player is taking forever to play.The game also tends to be fairly light hearted. No one knows where anyone else is going, so no one can specifically choose to try to block a specific person (likewise, that never seems to be an optimal move anyway). No one's feeling should get hurt by the time the game has finished.The overall quality of the peices of the game are also quite good. The board is very nice (but large), the train peices are a light plastic that holds up (but try not to step on them), and the cards are pretty durable. The box also holds all of the pieces quite neatly, so you don't need to fumble around the box trying to find whatever piece you now need.I would definately recommend this game to anyone interested in the least.

A game lasts between 30 and 60 minutes.You will draw and play train cards in order to build routes connecting cities on your route cards.  Each turn you decide if you want to draw more train cards, play your cards to connect two cities (before someone else takes the route, but be careful that you don't give them the opportunity to block you), or draw more route cards (gaining points if you complete the route, or losing points if you are unable to do so before the end of the game).I prefer playing with 4-5 players, as there is more direct competition, trying to work around the trains that others have placed.  2-3 players is fun as well, but with 2 players, it sometimes turns into a game where each player is playing on their own side of the board with little interaction.For 2-3 players, I prefer theTicket To Ride: Nordic Countriesand the Switzerland (now included withTicket To Ride India: Map Collection - Volume 2) expansion maps.",5.0,Great board game for 4-5 players.

I'm currently addicted to the online version of this game, but I've played the real thing as well. It's a great game for 2-5 people. Honestly, I think it's more fun if you have 3-5 players because there's more potential for your planned routes to be disrupted. When you play a computer, it's not really out to get you, I don't think... people, however, are often out to get you. You know your true friends when they relish the thought of purposefully foiling your perfect train route.I like that it's a relatively quick game with a definite end. Some games (like monopoly)  are great but there's the potential for it to run very, very long. When this game promises to be done in about an hour, it carries out that promise. Lots of replay value here because there are numerous routes. At the same time, it's an easy game to learn, so you can teach a new bunch of people how to play in just a few minutes.The slight downside is that it's only for 5 players. We've played with 6 before by doubling up, but it's not exactly conducive to huge gatherings.Have fun.",5.0,Excellent family or friends game,1385769600,"11 30, 2013",Toys_and_Games,1.0

We have not been disappointed!  Ticket to Ride is incredibly easy to learn, but will still challenge you every time.  There is a huge variety in the strategies you can adopt to claim victory.  My wife and I have now played Ticket to Ride several times together.  We thoroughly enjoy the game, but I suspect it would be even more fun in groups of 4 or more players.  Unlike some of the other winners of the Spiel des Jahres, you could easily start children on Ticket to Ride fairly early (perhaps even as young as 6 or 7).

The game does change quite a bit with different numbers of players, which is nice (variety).We think it has the right mix of luck and skill.  It can initially seem too luck based (draw bad cards), but you realize there are strategies to deal with that.Quick to set up and put away, and well made.  Quick to play (less than an hour).I suspect people who find Settlers of Catan and Dominion fun but too involved might like this.The on-line version is great because it is so convenient.  It shows you the cities you need to connect which is really handy.  It is I think $10 per person for a life-time account.

The winner is not determined by who can go around the board first.  After the format of the came is learned (it just takes a couple of seconds), the rest is simple.  Your given cards that have location on them and the center of the board is a map with the corresponding location to the cards.  The entire point of the game is to make a train track that connects the locations your assigned.  The tracks and cards are worth varying amounts of points that determine the score.  Players can either concentrate on completing their assigned track or try to sabotage the other players by laying tracks to black where they think the other players need to put them.We also enjoy this game because it's difficult to find a fun 2 person game and the game is even more fun with more people.  More people mean more tracks on the board, making it more difficult to complete your own tracks.I give this game 5 stars and it will be a classic in our house, like monopoly (without the fights).",5.0,Hours of Fun,1354233600,"11 30, 2012",Toys_and_Games,1.0

You just cut me off, now instead of destination cards giving me gobs of points, now they all count against me.  There&#8217;s no way around!  My nerves have never felt more vexed than they do now.  That&#8217;s Jane Austin speak for: I&#8217;m seeing red and now I&#8217;m going to do anything I think might hurt your chances for the rest of the game; and the next one we play!Ok, so the first time this happens, there&#8217;s usually another way around, it&#8217;s probably the long way around, but hopefully you have enough trains to make it, because that&#8217;s a constraint you have to work under.Game PlayThis handsomely illustrated elongated board looks has a map of the United States dotted with notable cities that are connected by short and long lines of rectangles (or tracks).  In line of track is one of several colors.You start the game with some cards in your hand that are nicely illustrated train cars of the same several colors.  Each turn you either  take you can draw two cards from either some face up cards or &#8220;roll the dice&#8221; and choose some from a facedown draw pile, or a combination.  If you pick a wild from the face-up pile, you only get one card that turn.  buy a route (lay down your trains on the rectangles between cities)  You buy the track by discarding from your hand the same number and color of cards of the track where you lay down your trains.  Draw three Destination Cards.  You&#8217;ve got to keep at least one.  These give a method to the madness of which routes you buy.As you lay down your trains you rack up points, The longer the track, the larger the gain.  If you successfully complete the route on your destination card, you also rack up points, but those you conceal till the end of the game.The game ends a full round after someone has fewer than four trains- everyone but the catalyst gets another turn.Points are scored as I&#8217;ve said, but those destinations you weren&#8217;t able to complete, yeah those count as negative points.  Oooo.. ouch.I hate to tell you what to do but&#8230;Keep an eye on how many trains your opponents have left, don&#8217;t be stupid and fill your hand with destinations when you won&#8217;t have time to complete them.If it looks like a route you need is one that your opponent might need, you have a vested interest in getting there first, even if it&#8217;s an easy one.You may even consider drawing more destination cards for your first turn or two so that you can spend more time in the game working on more that are related. Than getting those you start with and drawing more in the middle of the game.What does &#8220;related&#8221; mean?  Consider the following routes:LA to Miami (goes from the south-east corner of the US to the south-west corner)New Orleans to Duluth (goes north and south through the center of the US)Salt Lake City to Houston (goes from the western US to the south-center)Because there could easily be much overlap in the first and third route, but not the second route, I&#8217;d dump the second route and keep the other two.ThemeWell, several off-shoots from Ticket to Ride have come.  Not to mention an expansions for the original game that adds several smaller routes.  So there is evidence that the theme can be slanted, but in Ticket To Ride Europe, game play is the same with some twists, like you can use someone else&#8217;s route for your destination&#8217;s sake without getting points for the route, and you route requiring tunneling through mountains are more pricey.  These off-shoot stand alone games are a good way for Days of Wonder to charge full price for what could have been a less expensive expansion to the existing game.I can hear you say, &#8220;Yeah, but they are boards in different venues!&#8221;Yes, they are, but Rio Grande seemed to be able to offer double-sided boards (Yes, that means two new maps) and new rule sets for Power Grid for less than half the cost of the original game.&#8220;Oh...  Really?&#8221;Yup.  But for comments to the theme itself, I think the original game is pretty strong.  Struggling to eek out routes to complete destinations- trying to get there before someone cuts you off can be very nerve racking, especially when two or more destination cards are riding on making that connection.  I&#8217;ve got lots of little trains!  Cool little plastic trains!BalanceWhile I often complain about chance and this game includes card, the fact that you don&#8217;t have to take all the destination cards you draw mitigates it, and that there are several face up cards to choose from also helps.  Anyone can build anywhere beats the imbalance Power Grid shackles you with.  Tit for tat.  Anyway, for having cards, I have no complaints.InteractionInteraction is low.  While verbal congrats are possible, expressions of dismay and indifference often follow someone laying track.  If you can&#8217;t reach the cards, there will be- &#8220;give me those two oranges&#8221; or, &#8220;how about two off the mystery pile of joy!  But as I think of it, this game could be played in silence.  So if you are entertaining that favorite group of mine to pick on- introverts, you already knew what you were in for.Learning CurveLow.  The purchase price card you get tells you how much things cost and the production of a square base on die roll and Robber operation are pretty easy.  Each development cards has what it does written plainly on it.  While the rules are easy, the options are pretty limited and objective is pretty straightforward.DowntimeNominal.  While you do have to wait your turn, there is a possibility that the track you want to buy gets bought on someone else&#8217;s turn.  If you pay attention you can make groans at the time they will pay off the most.What&#8217;s not to Like?I can&#8217;t think of anything bad to say that I haven&#8217;t already said.  It&#8217;s a great game that has done much good for the industry and I trust the makers are raking in mega bucks with all their spin offs.  If people are willing to pay, they deserve it.  Ah, the beauty of capitalism.  I guess there are eccentric people out there, who are happy to shell out another $35 to $50.Collateral EndorsementI haven&#8217;t come across a soul who didn&#8217;t like this game, but you may say that my social circles are small.  You are probably right, but I love growing them with games.  My kids love to line up the trains from here to there, but they have severed my board in one place, so beware, the (read: any) board is best set up on a table rather than the carpet floor where wee feet are wont to walk.",5.0,The Early Bird Catches the Worm,1404172800,"07 1, 2014",Toys_and_Games,1.0

And since there are so many route cards, I've never played the 'same' game twice, although it is easy to pick out some of the more popular routes once you've played the game a number of times.You will need a decent sized tabletop to play this on--we tried on a 3x6 folding table and there just isn't enough room for all the cards, trains, and the board together if you have more than 3 people playing.My only complaint is that the scoring mechanism is pretty cumbersome.

I wanted a new game to bring to our family reunion, and thought TTR was just the, well... ticket.  I watched it on Amazon, and ordered it when the price dropped a little.  The game has been very well received by our family.  Our youngest daughter, 10, is probably the most enthusiastic, especially after winning the second game we played!  The rules are straightforward, and the game play is simple--players choose one of three possible actions for their turn--making the game as easy to start playing as any of the more well known family board games, like Sorry, Life, or Clue.  It's on par with Risk or Monopoly in that developing a plan will help you win the game, but the game is still enjoyable if played more casually.  Game play is fast once you get into a rhythm.  The bright, colorful, and solidly made game components look to last for years of hard play.  It even comes with a few extra pieces of each color, as a protection against loss.  The availability of expansion modules (USA 1910, Switzerland) and companion editions (Europe, Marklin (Germany) and Nordic Countries) means if you like TTR, you'll be able to play variants for years to come.  (My 13 year old daughter has already asked for TTR Europe for Christmas.)  A real bonus is the key that comes inside the game, enabling you to play online at the Days of Wonder website.  You can play solo against capable ""bots,"" or test your skill against hundreds of online human opponents.

It comes with a HUGE board, so be prepared to play on a large table or on the floor.  Lots of little plastic trains, brightly colored, nice graphics.  Game uses small cards, two separate decks, destination tickets and train cards(same size).  Mechanics are simple--take one action (draw 3 destination tickets and keep 1 or more, draw two train cards, or use the train cards you already have to claim a route) and score it (if it scores).  You then compete with your opponent(s) to build the longest route, score the highest points, and connect all of the cities shown on your destination ticket(s).  It's easy to get caught up in finishing routes on the tickets, though.  You can end up pulling lots of train cards trying to get enough of one color instead of building routes and scoring along the way--potentially losing you the lead (especially if your opponent(s) block your way).  Also, if you don't finish a mission, it will detract from your points at the end of the game.  I'd recommend this to anyone who enjoys a fairly laid-back game with simple mechanics.

It is a simple game where you try and get multiple cards of the same color, to match up with the corresponding colors on the routes on the map. You score points for going from one city to another, scoring more for larger routes. You draw &#34;destination cards&#34; that have 2 cities on them, and if you connect them you score bonus points. The game consists of players making their own routes longer, or blocking other players. Not very much to it, and it is really annoying when 5 turns go by and you never get the cards you need. There is a decent amount of strategy in this game, but it is nowhere near as fun as Power Grid, Carcassonne, Puerto Rico, or 7 Wonders.

Here's how:  After a person is down to 2 or less trains, it becomes the last and final round for everyone else and stops back at that person.  The game then ends and calculating the score begins.  For every destination cards that you didn't or were not able to complete, you subtract that number score on the card.  Then the person with the longest train route score an extra 10 points.

The game takes about 1 hour to play.  The only good thing I can say is the artwork is beautiful.  The cover belongs in a frame and should be hung on a wall. I was accused of being vindictive for blocking two other players deliberately, which is not against the rules.  When I suggested modifying some rules, which would make that type of strategy a waste, those two players said no.  I went to bed angry that night for being labeled the villain.  I was still angry the next morning, and I was angry all day at work over the game!  I haven't played it with them since. Two rules I consider most needing to be fixed are: 1. There should be no penalty for incomplete destinations. 2. Allow the use of double paths for THREE or more players. When a player's destination becomes DELIBERATELY blocked, I see the same kind of irritation you get when a player is attacked in the game of RISK, and that attack takes a continent away from them. Also, the small cars are too easily knocked around on the board. If someone offered me some money for the game, it would take 2 seconds for me to sell it.

I was initially concerned because it is possible to block someone's route and with only two people this had the potential to get pretty competitive and personal, but in practice even if your most direct route is blocked, it's usually possible to find another way around.

Basically the game is a map of the USA with train routes connecting cities. You draw train routes (Omaha to Seattle, for example) and try to collect enough colored cards matching the color of the tracks. Usually, but not always, there are a few ways to get to your destinations which is a good thing since other players can block your progress. Nobody knows the routes you have and you can play anywhere you want even if you don't have any trip tickets for a route. We play this game at least once a week and everybody loves it. You can win a game on your second try. It doesn't take alot of extra learning to get better. Obviously you gain some experience playing more but that doesn't necessarily mean you will win. I gave it 4 stars because the cards that come with it are miniature. Don't know why they do this. I bought (maybe that is why they do it) an addition, 1910 which replaces the Trip tickets and train cards with normal sized cards. As mentioned above, I also got the Alvin and Dexter addition wehich adds some chaos to the game, which I love. That addition has to little non-discript chararcters which I detailed painted to make them look better. Some people love that addition others find it too stressful. I love it.

The routes are kept secret until the end of the game.  For every route completed, a player earns an amount of points.  To complete your route, you have to collect cards representing the routes that allow you to ""travel"".

Players can complete more than one route and the longest train receives additional points.  The game ends with a final round after a player gets down to three train cars left to place.

Ticket to Ride is a board game that includes cards and trains; The board looks a little bit like a map. Ticket to Ride is $40.00-$50.00. This game is my families favorite game.I really enjoy this game because, up to 5 people can play, it is challenging, and there are acouple extra trains in case you lose one.I have no complaints about this game. I would say it is more of an adult game but kids do like to play with the trains. My family will play the game while my six year old sister plays with the trains.If you do not like games don't get this one because it may go on forever.

Then I talked with a guy whose family loves all kinds of games (as we do) and he highly recommended it. It's a bit on the expensive side for a game you're afraid you won't like, but I took a chance based on his recommendation.Well, my husband and I love it! The concept is very simple to learn. We had the basic mechanics down after one game. We've had it now about two weeks and have played 40+ games. I will say that our teenager does not love it. He will play occasionally but he says it doesn't have enough of a 'mission' for him.The game is pretty quick with 2 people, 20-30 minutes. The one negative with 2 people is that, after a number of plays, you can tell where your opponent is going because you've memorized the destination tickets. We're looking forward to playing with friends and think this will definitely up the excitement and call for new strategy. However, I have ordered the 1910 expansion after reading many reviews recommending this for more depth to the game.For casual gamers who play occasionally, I think the basic game will give you fun play for a long time to come. If you play a lot, you'll probably want to consider an expansion. We may ultimately end up getting TTR Europe later on. It sounds like, if you're really into games, that Europe has a bit more diversity in the kinds of routes and the types of moves you can make. It's probably a deeper game for 2 people, which is how we usually play. Hopefully 1910 will give us enough depth to keep it exciting for a while to come.As a point of reference, other games that we like are Rummikub, Forbidden Island (although we want to go to Pandemic now for more challenge), Phase 10, Guillotine, Monopoly, Spy Alley, Munchkin, 221B Baker Street, Spades.

Unlike some German-style games, the rule book is two pages and it takes only minutes to set up and learn the game. The rules are simple and not convoluted, yet the game is still complex enough to be interesting.Replayability - because the goals are randomly distributed, this game seems to have almost infinite replayability. We've played hundreds of times, and I can't see a way in which we will get bored; the game changes based on goals, and also based on the cards you draw during the game.Healthy randomness &#8211; generally I'm anti-luck in board games, but in this case the only randomness is what cards are drawn. However, this is mitigated by a face-up area of train cards (decreasing the randomness, though not eliminating it), by a lot of ways to get around needing very specific cards, and by the ability to discard strategy cards whenever they are chosen.Narrative/game play &#8211; the story that accompanies the game is fun, but the game play is the real strength. It moves fast, and though not everyone is involved at every turn, turns are short enough that you are not bored waiting for others.

Using plastic train cards, players attempt to connect cities on cards they hold and block other players' routes. The game can be played in either a friendly non-confrontational manner, or very strategically and aggressively. Ticket to Ride, though designed by an American and published by an America/French company, is an example of a European-style strategy boardgame. If you like this game, you might want to learn more about the hobby. Boardgamegeek.com is a great source of information, though maybe overwhelming at first.

Its one of those games where you never need to reference the rules after the first time you play it.
