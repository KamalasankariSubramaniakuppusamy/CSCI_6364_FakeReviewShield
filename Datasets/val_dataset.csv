I asked why: they said because it has adventure,group play (kids don't play together as much these days I guess), and the game is different every time, not like playing the same level of a video game over and over.

First, I had my first trac ball set in the early to mid 80s so I never experienced the styrofoam balls some are discussing.  So, while the balls from my old set looked very similar - textured, hollow yellow plastic - they weighed quite a bit less than these modern versions.The hardest part to get across to my kids is that you need to be pretty agressive in putting spin on the ball in order for it to curve or ""float"".  But my kids love it and I still find it a ton of fun.  THe quality seems pretty much the same as the old set, which is nice to see.  The ""raquets"" are plastic and it would be pretty easy to break them if you don't take care of them.On a side note:  this goes back a few years, but did any other Trac Ball fans notice a raquet (painted silver) in The Phantom Menace - hanging in the shop on Tattooine where Anakin worked?

B&N; are less than helpful in the their support (48 hrs per response in my two sets of exchanges). I bought the device to do a ""little bit of everything"" but really mostly wanted video support as well as books. I thought I would use the internet more but didn't because it was a bit cumbersome and seemed to be confused by website design (site deciding whether it was a mobile device or not and maybe it was trying to optimize viewing?).This devices falls between an e-reader and tablet. There are plenty of arguments both ways on Amazon so I won't do more than my two cents. I have sold my NC and moved on.Major gripes: it locked up constantly during video playback. I do video and editing and file conversion regularly for my job and the device is very ""low-brow"" in it's use of codecs since it uses the Android OS and there aren't better video players available for the NC at this time. You have to run the simplest of conversions schemes (there are a lot of discussions on this online and you can find the correct converter- I used Handbrake) so quality lacks compared to other ""tablets"". Since this was one of my main uses of the NC, this is a killer for me. It is too frustrating having to restart it all the time.PDF viewing was terrible. There are better descriptions again on Amazon, but my problem was it never kept it's place and it sometimes would only give me the first page and not want to move on.Ebooks read great until the newest firmware, then got a bit ""sticky"" and less smooth on page turning and viewing.Apps are just plain awful right now, but I am sure it will get better.Expansion card access and use was not good, but you get used to it. File management for extra movies or pdf's on the device required a computer plain and simple. This is just seems like lazy programming.Battery life was awful. 2-3 hours of movie watching max with screen brightness at 80% (pretty bright, mind you, but needed for a well-lit room) if you use leave wifi on, it drains it faster. The battery also drains with wifi off and just sitting around. After 3-4 days it gone. Really abysmal. (And yes, I had the battery checked out). Mine was actually better than most.

Bailey ""cbailey139""","[0, 0]","I have bought several Blue Loggers along with some other hardware and software, notably GPS PostPro, DeLorme's software that will postprocess GPS data to make more accurate positional measurements.The point of postprocessing is to use data acquired over minutes or hours, for example by the Blue Logger, and do calculations after the fact comparing these data to data logged at fixed GPS observing stations around the USA or world. You can measure a point to a few inches, when things go well.If you spend thousands of dollars you can get a nice GPS receiver and software for doing this, like surveyors do. The Blue Logger and PostPro let you do the same thing, though not quite as precisely, for a few hundred dollars. You can't use just any GPS receiver - it has to record information separately for every GPS satellite.So, the Blue Logger is the only product out there that can do this unless you spend thousands.On the plus side is the fact that this is even possible. And, the Logger feels like a nice solid little device.On the minus side, though, Blue Loggers just barely work. They're probably the most unreliable and difficult electronic product I've ever tried to use. They keep malfunctioning. To make matters worse, I bet other companies that might have tried to put similar products out there would not want to now, because these things are convincing consumers that postprocessing is difficult.I keep using them because I really want the results, but I curse their unreliability every time I do. And this would have been such a perfect product, if they'd made them work right.I gave them a moderate rating because it's great that there is any product out there at all for doing this. If there were competing products I'd have to give Blue Loggers a thumbs down completely.If you want to see bright people struggling bravely with a cursed and evil product, go look at the Blue Logger Receiver forum at delorme.com.",3.0,Allows postprocessing to get submeter accuracy,1204848000,"03 7, 2008",Electronics,0.0,,

They help tremendously with getting ready in the morning and getting ready at bedtime.  I don't use the tokens that come with the system.  I think the instructions say it won't work without the tokens, but I found them unnecessary after the 1st month of getting used to the system.  Then they became more of a bother than they were worth.  My kids are just expected to do their cards. In the morning they must have their yellow cards done before they're allowed to play or watch morning shows & at bedtime they must have them done before our timer goes off in order to get their bedtime story (they  almost always get them done because that's a big motivator).  Now, my 2 1/2 year old has been requesting chore cards, so I'm getting a set for her. I like that you can individualize the cards.  You can choose which ones you want to use & it also comes with blank stickers so you can make up your own.  It is easy to adapt by age.  For example, my 6 year old has more cards that she's responsible for doing than my 4 year old, and my 2 year old will start out with just a few.  I've actually considered getting one for myself because it is such a good visual reminder of what has been completed and what still needs to be done. It helps me to not have to nag the kids.

It replaces the keyboard on the Kindle with a color touch screen about the size of the iPhone display. This makes it easy to maneuver between  the store, your library, your current book, the daily (with messages, newsletters, and other free content), and settings. The LCD display changes from menu items to images of book covers to a keyboard as needed, and then turns off when reading.You can connect by both WiFI and free 3G to download a purchase in seconds, and connect with WiFi to get content and other offers when you walk into a B&N; store. I'm using the latest 1.1.1 SW release that fixes most of the issues noted in early reviews. Updates are done automatically over the air.The nook feels great in the hand with a slightly contoured back that adds a little thickness for the hand to grip. Controls are provided for equal usability by a left or right-hander person. The back is removable and replaceable with different colors. They are all rubber coated to make it less likely to drop. Unlike the Kindle the battery is replaceable and the memory is expandable. The e-ink display is the same type, but appears to be slightly crisper than the Kindle 2. The nook supports  EPUB (Non or Adobe DRM), PDB (Non DRM), PDF, Graphics: JPG, GIF, PNG, BMP, Audio: MP3, PDB. The online B&N; bookstore has about a million books compared to the Kindle store with half that, the major difference being the free public domain books provided by Google.Summary:While it costs the same as the Kindle, the nook is loaded with extra features: WiFi, color LCD, removable battery, expandable memory, more open book formats.  You can customize your nook with your own photos to create personal screen savers and lend between nook, iPhone, a PC and a Mac.",5.0,Nook is the best e-reader yet,1261526400,"12 23, 2009",Electronics,1.0,,

I was surprised at how easy it was to pick up and start playing.The object of the game is simple: the players take the role of a character and go into a dungeon to kill monsters to get loot. Whoever gets sufficient loot (this depends on the character, with more powerful characters needing more loot) and makes it out of the dungeon first, wins the game.Combat is very straightforward. The non-wizard characters are all basically the game, merely determining what number the character needs to roll to kill a monster. If the roll fails, the monster strikes back, possibly missing, dealing wounds (forcing a treasure drop), or even killing the player making them start from the beginning of the game.Every fight has a very small chance of the player getting killed, sending the character from the game and having all his/her loot claimed by the monster. The player can start over with a new character on their next turn (and will probably make a beeline for where his old character died, hopefully reclaiming the loot before another player grabs it).Overall for the price, and for the nostalgic factor for those who played the original back when it released in 1975, this is a great buy for any tabletop, rpg gamer, or those just getting into the genre.",5.0,Review,1400112000,"05 15, 2014",Toys_and_Games,1.0,,

It is very easy to create your own profile and not see all the junk your spouse has but, at the same time can pick what you want that they have.  No need to repurchase what they already have.What Barnes and Nobel doesn't really want you to know is that you can put Amazon's Kindle app on the nook and read Kindle books (both free and purchased from Amazon).  I also noted that, with the Kindle app, you can adjust the fonts and resize PDF documents that you cannot do on the nook when reading PDF's.Lets not forget its a 9 in screen.  Battery holds well at 10 hours.I bought a 32GB SD card and so far have put 15 movies ( and stiil room for many more) on the card to watch in HD. I choose to save the memory on the nook for books or other apps and watch my movies from the tiny SD micro card. Buy ""DVD Catalyst"" ( really cool program for $9.95)(can try it for free)on line to compress those movies from DVD and then it automatically puts it on the micro card.I seen some gripes about them adding Google store.  Not sure how you can complain about ading a whole another facet of apps.  IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT THEN DON'T ADD ANY GOOGLE APPS. Its still a free country.So for reading ebooks, movies, games, apps and many others all for $179.00, for me it hit my tickle spot.

We were the most impressed with the fact CS is located in America with English speaking reps who we could actually understand!The Nook Color is a lot more than a book reader. Frankly we wouldn't have bought it if that was all it was. Since the Nook is built on an Android platform there are a few thousand apps to keep you busy between books. The screen colors are very crisp and the video is blu ray quality. We haven't owned either of ours long, but we haven't had to charge the battery yet. It has a very long life.Since we don't own a smartphone, the Nook is the next best thing. Apart from not being able to take a call with it, it will do most everything a smartphone will do without the $100 per month bill. We look forward to taking it on our long drives to use as a way of figuring out what is in the next town, checking gas prices and finding discount hotel rooms on the fly. It will save us a lot more than the purchase price.I'm sure we will find a lot more to do with the Nook over time. We are especially excited to use Netflix when it is released for the Nook. The only reason we gave it four stars instead of five is because there is always room for improvement. Maybe they will find a way to add a phone to it.

I'm also not sure why everyone here is complaining about freezing and having to restart so often; I've never had any problems with that!

If you go with the kindle, you're stranded going to online retailers that sell the MOBI format, whereas most places garanteed carry the epub.

The first time I used it, this plastic piece broke, which allowed the anchor to become much flatter which then allowed it to squeeze through the door.  I have to admit, this was an internal hollow core lightweight door that does not lock or secure very well.  When the plastic piece broke it also jarred the door allowing the latch to open, the anchor then shot forward and smacked me very hard in the center of my back.  I posted a picture as well.

My plan was to carry them back and forth between work and home (on public transportation) so I needed something that would be small, light, and unbreakable.  I had tried theTupperware Midget Salt & Pepper Shaker NEW Rare Purple, but found that the 2-ounce size of the container was too big, and that it took up too much room at the office and in my tote bag.  This smaller, 1-ounce size was much better for meeting my needs.Luckily, Tupperware makes their products so that the same size lids will sometimes work on similar containers, depending on the size of the lip of the container.  These two products looked like the lids would be interchangeable, so I took a chance and placed the order.  I'm happy to report the shaker part of the original set I bought fits perfectly onto this container.  By the way, the salt and pepper lids work on this set, too:Tupperware Smidget Container 1oz Each Assorted Set 5I have been hunting for a good set of portable salt and pepper shakers for years. By combining these two products, the mission was accomplished!  Note - I plan to re-post this review, with minor variations, on these two other product pages, so if you see it over there, you won't need to re-read the details.Any Tupperware container with a round lid is leak proof, so you can fill them up with small quantities of shampoo, conditioner, mouthwash, toothpaste, etc., and take them on the road, without worrying about leaks.  I have NEVER had a problem with a leak from a Tupperware container with a round lip.  As an added bonus, the containers have a lot of uses.  You can use them to keep your spices fresh.  My mom used to use them to store Wilton icing coloring dyes. They would be good for small quantities of craft products.  They are perfect for maintaining order over the small things that get thrown into a junk drawer.  These things are handy, so this list could go on and on.From my experience with Tupperware, sometimes the lids are a bit tight-fitting when they are new.  If you soak the lid in hot water for a couple of minutes, it will expand slightly, and will easily fit onto the container.  You should only need to do this one or two times; after that, they should fit without pre-soaking.Color - 2 starsThe color is ugly, and I would not call it pink.  It is more of a watered-down version of a coral-like (or maybe salmon-like) tint than pink.  When I saw the color on the computer screen, I thought the color difference between my idea of pink and the reality would be chalked up to the virtual world.  But the reality was worse than the monitor.  :p  Saying this color is ""pink"" isn't even as accurate as saying that ""aquamarine"" is ""green"" or ""blue.""  I'm glad I didn't plan to keep these out on the table.Value Analysis - 3 starsIn the past, it was always been worth paying a little extra for Tupperware because of the superior quality of the Tupperware brand, as well as the lifetime guarantee.  With this order, however, I noticed that the plastic feels slightly thinner and more brittle than the Tupperware containers I bought 20 years ago.  I actually took some of the older containers out and did a side-by-side comparison, and I liked the older ones better.  I'm afraid the containers may not be as durable as they used to be, but they still seem to be very durable.  Tupperware is still superior to most plastics, but the quality of Rubbermaid has improved over the years, and Rubbermaid is much less expensive.  If my Rubbermaid fails, I just throw it out and buy a new one.When I have used the warranty, it has provided a needed replacement for a favorite piece of plastic, and I've been very pleased with the results.  Balance this against the fact that, if I want to return a Tupperware product that fails, I have to pay shipping to send it back to them.  This is often just as expensive as the cost of the item being replaced.  I also have to pay shipping and handling for them to send the replacement back to me.  According to their web site, this is currently (May 2013) a flat rate of $5.75.  (And this assumes that the item can still be replaced, and you don't end up with a substitute.  You may wind up with a replacement of a different color, so the set you have no longer matches.)  I have a few pieces of Tupperware that need to be replaced, but have decided it's just not economical to do so.  So the pieces sit there in the back of the closet while I wait for the pile to grow large enough to make it worth the cost of sending them in and getting them replaced.  I have tried to convince myself to just throw them out, but they don't take up much room. ;)Is Tupperware worth the extra cost?  Yes, but only for especially useful and/or unique pieces.  Personally, I'm planning to seek out this brand only if nothing else will meet the need I have.",4.0,Is Tupperware Worth the Cost?,1367712000,"05 5, 2013",Home_and_Kitchen,1.0,,

If you screw the bolt of the wheel tightly against the backboard, the spinning wheel comes to an abrupt halt after you spin it, instead of slowly rolling to a gradual stop like the wheels you see at carnivals. That takes away the fun and excitement of participants who would otherwise watch the wheel slowing down as they hope it stops on their prize (or number). Conversely, if you screw the bolt in too loose the wheel becomes all wobbly, causing it to bang against the backboard and affecting the turning of the wheel so that it's spin seems unnatural, the last thing you want in a game with any kind of prizes where people might wonder if it's somehow rigged. The dry-erase surface is a bit odd and hard to make look professional when you're just using dry-erse markers unless you have perfect handwriting. The manufacturer says to email them if you want to find out where to get pre-fitted word documents that you can customize, but I emailed them and didn't get a reply. I don't see how cut up word documents would fit on the wheel without tape or glue so I didn't pursue it. And yes it's relatively easy to assemble even without instructions, but for this kind of money the least they should do is include some type of written directions so you wouldn't have to do it by trial and error. Also, one of the four corner pads on the bottom of the base was missing, so I took the other three off to make it level. Overall it seems sturdy but even so, it is way overpriced.

All of these points will improve our sense of well being.I like this particular Mandala coloring book by Marty Noble because it is a bit more complicated that her other mandala coloring books.  These are very traditional type designs that exhibit ancient sacred designs that span across several spiritual traditions.  They are easily removed from the book to work one at a time.  Four Star:  The designs are on each page, front and back.  This means you cannot use alcohol markers or markers that will bleed through the paper and ruin the other side.  Use high quality coloring pencils for best results.Creative Suggestion: Is to put your favorite design on an overhead projector, shine it on a chosen spot on a blank canvas and trace it. Then fill in with acrylics or oils or even water colors. Or you could complete this same process and project on a wall. This is sure to make an inspirational, yet soothing statement to your surroundings.",4.0,"Creative, soothing and inspirational spiritual mandalas to enjoy",1388620800,"01 2, 2014",Toys_and_Games,1.0,,

I'm currently addicted to the online version of this game, but I've played the real thing as well. It's a great game for 2-5 people. Honestly, I think it's more fun if you have 3-5 players because there's more potential for your planned routes to be disrupted. When you play a computer, it's not really out to get you, I don't think... people, however, are often out to get you. You know your true friends when they relish the thought of purposefully foiling your perfect train route.I like that it's a relatively quick game with a definite end. Some games (like monopoly)  are great but there's the potential for it to run very, very long. When this game promises to be done in about an hour, it carries out that promise. Lots of replay value here because there are numerous routes. At the same time, it's an easy game to learn, so you can teach a new bunch of people how to play in just a few minutes.The slight downside is that it's only for 5 players.

Not only is it a snazzy red color, it works great: it freezes the ice cream fluffy and firm in 20-30 minutes and creates 1.5 quarts of ice cream from about 3 cups of liquid.  It's incredible!  It's also very affordable.  We're going to give it as a gift this year to all our friends!Our previous ice cream maker (a different brand) wouldn't freeze at all but just made the liquid warm and frothy, no matter how long we left the basin in the freezer beforehand.  This one freezes great as long as the basin has been in the freezer ""overnight"" ... roughly 12-15 hours.  So make sure to plan ahead before you make ice cream.  Also, make sure not to fill the basin full of liquid ... a little over 3 cups of liquid sometimes overflows the basin with ice cream!Our previous ice cream maker was also side-dispensing and had a hole for the mixing arm to come through the basin, which is messy for cleaning, etc.  The top-dispensing is great, as you can remove the basin to serve ice cream from it easily, without worrying about it spilling out a hole in the bottom made for the mixing arm in a side-dispensing model.Overall, it's a fabulous product.

This is basically the users input interface, besides being the ""just the screen"". The usefulness of a tablet is directly proportional to the quality of it screen. This is one thing that manufacturers and users or buyers should always keep in mind.I bought this Coby Kyros last April 2011, and so far I haven't actually enjoyed it. It is slow, period, there is no question about it. But I can live with it, I got what I paid for, I expected it.My main difficulty is using the Coby Kyros touch screen. For example if I want to manage my applications, naturally I will have to scroll through the list of applications. In doing this, I really have to be really really soft with my finger or stylus swiping, because one very little unintentional touch on an application will open it! And that is not what I want, I only want to scroll through the list.I wish there is a real ""scroller"" at the sides of the screen so I won't have to touch the screen when I just want to scroll either vertically or horizontally. As it is, this simple scrolling becomes so messy, and giving me a lot of frustration. This touchscreen is so sensitive to pressure. And you can't read the screen out in the open, there is so much glare!This problem must be addressed. This is really important because with this problem, a user cannot really run anything happily on this tablet. Maybe some calculator apps  are ok, but why not just buy a real calculator. The AMAZON app itself for this table t sucks. It just gives me product recommendations, where is my wish list, etc.? Well, you go to HELP and then login again, and then it will bring you to the amazon website. For me, this is simply like giving me a link to the website, and not a real app. I just deleted that app, listen guys, it sucks! I have a 7-inch real state, that app logo would occupy some of it, and it doesn't give me anything but ""offerings"" to buy?! This app is a bad example, but I should say that even if an app is good, you won't probably enjoy it on this Coby screen, it boils down to that.This Coby product is not good. My experience with it seems to give me an impression that I wish they did not make this a touch screen tablet! Because, they did not make it right anyway! I know this is a resistive screen and not a capacitive screen like those of iPods or iPhones, and my expectations should be lowered, but man, that expectation shouldn't be so low that it should almost be touching the ground. That simply won't do it anymore. I couldn't sleep tonight without writing this review.

Ashtanga is a difficult, style of yoga. If you are not familiar with it but want to start this style, it is best to take a class, not use a video. (a video can be great for getting an idea of what to expect, but you will not get the correction and instruction that meets your individual needs from a video)2. Each series in Ashtanga(first, second, third, etc) is always the same sequence of poses. It is designed that one masters each pose and then moves on to the next, eventually completing the series. When one masters the first series (and this might take many years) one moves on to the second.3. Three months of yoga, no matter how many days a week you do it still makes you a beginner. One of my instructors has said you are a beginner until you have 10 years of consistent daily practice. Maybe that is a bit of an overstatement...but maybe not. Part of yoga is letting go of ego and being present where you are, wherever that is.So, yes, this is not a video for someone brand new to yoga. But if you are familiar with Ashtanga and want a tape to practice with at home, between classes, this might be exactly what you are looking for.",5.0,"Re: ""Mr. Freeman..."" review",1156809600,"08 29, 2006",Sports_and_Outdoors,1.0,,

I spoke with the owner Dan Weidner pertaining to some questions about the bands and the man is an absolute professional. He was very polite and answered all my questions and told me I could contact him anytime. He sincerely wanted me to feel happy with my purchase.I'm a 55 year old man with several medical conditions that now prevent me from work. I'm on social security disability due to a 38 year chronic back condition, 13 years of fibromyalgia and recently diagnosed with several bulging degenerative discs. This has resulted in several misaligned discs causing me multi-level bi-lateral foraminal stenosis of the spine. I have moderate to severe numbness in both my legs. Since I was a teenager, I have done some form of exercise, swimming, running, bodybuilding, elliptical and Nordic Track. It is only after I turned 52 that I really began to have major medical problems due to the combination of the above. I lost the ability to lift weights which has always been my physical therapy. I need to keep active and keep my muscles active and strong to support my spine and reduce the muscles spasms caused by Fibromyalgia.I thought I'd give these resistance bands a try and I couldn't be more satisfied customer. I have been lifting weights for 35 years but can't use them anymore, that is, unless I want to end up in the emergency room. These bands are very easy to use. I find them to work my muscles better than weights and weight machines because they stretch the muscle throughout the movement, really great for my Fibromyalgia condition. Of course you should use the appropriate band(s) and do the exercise fluidly and slow, no jerking or relaxing upon completion of the movement to get the full effect. These bands remind me of the bands I used for swimming team practice.I would recommend purchasing these resistance bands sold by BLACK MOUNTAIN as they are well worth the money. Take this review from someone who has been into fitness for most of his life and who has used a variety of gym equipment; and if you have a muscular/neurological conditions like me than these are for you.The bands are well made and the hand grips are very comfortable.I've altered several exercises in the manual to fit my condition and added a few of my own as follows.SEATED ROW - IX and XIVPlace door anchor about 18 inches above floor.Put resistance bands into door anchorSit down on floor with legs flat on floor at a 45 degree angle facing door (opposite angle from door anchor.)TRICEP EXTENSION - IIIPlace door anchor in top middle of door.Put resistance bands into door anchorPush down and back with BOTH hands bending at the elbow.LAT PULL DOWN - XIII (standing as in instructions does not work for me)Place door anchor in top middle of door.Put resistance bands into door anchorSit with back against door and legs straight out on floor.Pull resistance bands straight down to where handle is parallel to shoulder.(This gives better support for my back and allowing for a better stretch).The following are exercises not in instruction booklet.SITTING LAT CHEST PULLDOWN(This builds lats in upper back and intercostal rib cage muscles.)Place door anchor in top middle of door.Put resistance bands into door anchorSit with back against door and legs straight out on floor.Keeping arms fully extended, pull resistance bands straight down (palms facing floor) to 12 to 18 inches above knee.FOREARM CURL(This is similar to exercise V the curl but builds forearm muscles instead of bicep.)Place band under feet.Curl band with palms facing down towards floor, instead of palms up as in bicep curl.FORWARD LATERAL RAISE(This is similar to exercise VI side lateral raise but gets deltoids at a different angle.)Place both feet over center of band.Keeping arms straight, raise arms forward and over head.",5.0,One of the best investments that I've ever made,1370736000,"06 9, 2013",Sports_and_Outdoors,1.0,,

Not to mention it wasn't really that hard either. The simplicity, muffledness and lightness in the background music really leave something to be desired. The vocals on the other hand are as loud as ever. In fact the lead singer seemed to be focusing more on singly loudly then singing well on a lot of the songs. The lyrics aren't that great either. They have the same lyrical flaw that a lot of their earlier work did. That flaw is that the lyrics really only apply to people in New York. Not everywhere. If you don't live in New York, most of the songs have nothing at all to do with the society you know of. Either that or it is about being a skin head which also doesn't apply to me.

After Bondi Digital put out the great Rolling Stone magazine compendium and the first edition of the Playboy decade series (the 50's and now the 60's), it was time to get to digitizing the whole collection. Playboy is the perfect subject for the Bondi treatment on so many levels - culturally, politically, aesthetically and yes even the advertising! (we love seeing ads from the 60's for things like the AMC's Javelin car, Hai Karate aftershave and a full set of Jack Nicklaus golf clubs for $199!)It's all there, every issue from Hef's famed Marilyn Monroe debut cover to Joanna Krupa's final cover of the first decade of the new millennium. One is stuck by many things, the calibre of the photography, the nature of the political times, decades of interviews (from all the legends you know, Norman Mailer to Woody Allen, Salman Rushdie to Bill Maher), even the print quality (a bit dot-screened in the early days to a much glossier look today.) Not to mention, of course, decades of beautiful babes from Anna Nicole to Pamela Anderson and virtually every Hollywood starlet of the last half century.The main thing, of course, is the functionality which through the digital domain allows the reader (viewer?) to browse every title by cover, date and decade, search for specific content (we read it for the articles, remember?) and view pages in full screen, double page and multiple levels of zoom formats. There are advanced search tools to even pare down your search across multiple parameters. One drawback: in keyword search you will be taken to the page of the word but the search term is not highlighted and your computer's `find' function may not work as well (at least on the Mac version we tested.) One nice feature is that the system supposedly allows you to create reading lists so you can add articles to a list for future reference and even export the list as well, (though we weren't quite sure how you get that feature to work and found nothing mentioning it in the documentation.)If there is a negative, it is perhaps that technology has advanced past the original CD-ROM curve that this series is based on. With the touchscreen, page-flip world of today (iPad, Kindle) and the shift towards cloud computing, it is only a matter of time before a new version of these compilations are expected by consumers. With this content already now digitized, it seem that such an item should be coming down the pike in the not-too-distant future.

Picked this up in order to give my Omega Seamaster a break (needs to be sent back to switzerland to get polished up). This watch is big, but very, very light. At the store where I picked mine up, I had the Seamaster in one hand and the Yachtsman in the other. The Yachtsman has probably twice the mass, but less than half the weight. It is good looking, and will be a conversation piece when worn with a suit at business meetings.The good: Time, stopwatch, barometer, thermometer, compass, and race timer. The race timer is essentially a countdown (you synchronize with race committee gunshots) followed by a stopwatch, with split time viewing and one-race memory. A couple good features: it can only be stopped by hitting the stop button twice in two seconds - good for those of you that wear sailing gloves. Beeps are audible unless the wind is howling above 20 knots. If you aren't a racer, you might do just as well with the x-lander, which excludes the racing timer but includes an altimeter, all within the same aesthetic package. The barometer includes a 1 hour interval memory (remember, 3 mbar change in under an hour and you're probably in trouble) and a thermometer. All units can be changed between imperial and metric. I haven't changed the battery yet but the compartment is opened with a coin, and looks very easy. Also, its a great looking watch if you can pull off the large size, and its relatively inexpensive.The bad: The contrast could be a little darker, and the backlight could be a little brighter. No seconds display on the standard time view. You can toggle seconds display briefly via pushing a button. Reading the manual (twice or three times) is an absolute must, because the buttons are unmarked. The thermometer doesn't take accurate readings while strapped on due to the heat from your wrist. The compass reading is a little jumpy (though in my experience, accurate). Lastly, I already knicked the aluminum bezel reaching into a closet... when I'm rolling around on the foredeck and trimming sails, its probably going to get pretty beat up.Overall, good product.

Recentley i purchased a tablet and really enjoyed that you could read books with a backlight and in color, beacause of that i went on the hunt for a color ebook. Now when Barnes and Noble started to come out with their ebooks I did not like them, I didnt like the desgin, when i would mess with them at Barnes and Nobel they just seemed redundant and to annoying to work with.  So When the Nook HD came out i researched and fell in love, I am soo happy i made this purchase.  I did not buy it from amazon as my local Kmart had it for 199.00 and you were able to put it in lay-a-way.  Some of the features this product needed to have were expandable memory, and screen functions to turn down backlight and make font bigger when needed. The screen resolution on this item in really nice, the touch screen is super responsive and the quality of the reading and easyness of use makes this an everyone can use product.  It is called a tablet and can be used that way, as you can get on the internet, access email, and also watch netflix if you choose but i wanted a color ebook not a smaller tablet so i really cant tell you how well it works as a tablet. I can tell you if you are looking for a good color Ereader this is the one i would recomend, like i said it is easy to use litteraly two pushes to open a book or access library page flipping is easy and controlls to make fonts larger or smaller, change paper color, even change font appearence are easy.  Also Barnes and Noble stores books on the cloud network for you when you take them off of you shelf. Magazines are interactive, and picture books for children are vibrant and enjoyable.  You can add up to 32gb of extra memory in micro miny memory card slot and the battery i have found if you turn off wifi can last you up to 2-3 weeks.  My sony lasted me about 1-2 months on a single charge so the two to three weeks is not that bad for me.

I was under the mistaken idea that a direct connection to my PC could be made and pictures transferred to it directly if it had a Wireless 802.11 N adapter which it does. However, this connection had to be configured through my home router to get to my wireless connected PC. Here's the line that led me to believe that; ""Photos and videos can automatically land in date-based folders of your choice on your computer or even directly into iPhoto for Macs."" (Yeah, if you have your PC connected to the router it can)! Then it does not support transfer of RAW format imagery and only transfers JPEG images. Even to get to that point, I had to set my camera's AUTO-ON CSM Mode to 30 minutes to allow the images to be transferred to the PC by way of the router (Nikon D80). Without that battery draining feature, the image transfer gets cut off in mid stream as the camera shuts down to save the battery power. Although it does transfer relatively quickly, it is very easy in this mode to forget you still have the power on and the batteries are being drained! My recommendation is spring for a high quality SD card and skip the transfer crap and move them onto your PC when you get the memory card plugged-in directly to it. Not enough versatility in the product for the money. Let me know when you've got the card to PC direct transfer done and then maybe I'll try them again.

I do, however, have my perspective, and my experience with the album.Since I got into music heavily some six years ago, this has been the album I have listened to most.  Though I would call Pearl Jam my favorite band, STP has undoubtedly received the most stereo play in my house.  Why?The answer lies in the sheer excellence of this album.  It is no where near as heavy as most of Pearl Jam's work (conceptually, as in the lyrics, as opposed to instrumentation), but still manages to be relevant, heart wrenching and encouraging.  Try to hear &quot;If you should die before me ask if you can bring a firend&quot; and not feel some flicker of emotion run through you.  Ponder that line.  Would you want to be dead alone?The album is not without its faults, though.  For one, I rarely have gotten past the eighth or ninth track.  I do not know whether this is because I at one time deemed the second half unworthy, or because STP stacked the best parts of its line up at the beginning.  I do know that the end of the CD might be as foreign to me today as the day I bought it.Returning to the high points, I love the sound that STP puts across here.  They sound as if they are travelling in a direction that had not been explored much at that time.  They are climbing out of grunge and into somewhat of a nuclear fallout:  they combine grunge, classic seventies rock, and their own stylings to liven up their record.Buy this album!",4.0,What is Left To Say?,1001376000,"09 25, 2001",Sports_and_Outdoors,1.0,,

I have assemblied two of the Polar Light Mercury/Ford kits and have found them to be challenging.  I have many years experiance asembling Monogram's stock car kits but this kit was a challenge due to some of the parts not fitting well.  The instruction sheet is very basic and you can figure out how the parts are to go together but it is best to test fit everything before gluing the part in place.  Also a trick I developed from the Monogram kit is to glue the roll cage together then let it dry on the chassis so it will fit properly (in other words use the chassis as a jig).  You don't have to glue the roll cage to chassis at that time just let it dry there.Another challenge is assembling the engines.  They give you a 427 cu in engine and a Boss 429 cu in engine on separate spruces but the instruction uses the same part numbers for each engine so you have to be very careful not to mix the parts.  The engines are not similar to each other so the parts will not fit right on the blocks.Once the chassis is assemblied with the roll cage, engine, exhaust, and drive train it is very authentic looking.  The body slips over the chassis and is held in place by the curve of body.  The decals are first rate, are easy to apply and will not bleed thru.  One tip I can give you from my research of NASCAR in the 1960s is that the sponsor decals on the front fender do not have to be in any particular order so arrange them as it pleases you.  The order changed from race to race as did the number of decals applied.So although the kit is a challenge to assembly, it produces a very nice model for you to display on a shelf.

The pieces are large enough for little hands to easily manipulate, however they do not lock together as securely as they could and they are not as thick or durable as the comparable Ravensburger.

I have only had it for about a week so I can't speak for it's reliability but I have loaded lots of free ebooks (what I bought it for) from various sources, some audio books for my kids, and some music.  I like the web browser and the sudoku game.  The only thing I would change if I could is to have an option to combine the ""my b&n library"" with ""my documents"" because when you get books from anywhere else besides B&N, it goes to your documents.  I would like to be able to pull up my ""mysteries"" shelf and be able to see all of my mysteries not just the ""documents"" set or the ""B&N"" set.  I think it would make it more user friendly to have that be an option (only an option since some people probably like it the way it is).

It was the voice recognition I was leery of. Though I've studied two languages through classes, I have no aptitude for speaking languages at all. The languages I'm most familiar with are the Teutonic/Germanic gutteral sounding languages; I have such problems with the romance languages. I married into a Portuguese-American family and they still howl with laughter when, after 21 years, I attempt the language.In addition, I've broken my ear drums a couple times, and have suffered loss of hearing as a result (compounded, could be, by age!).I am very happy to say that I have had no problem hearing or understanding the Rosetta program.  The included headphone/microphone combo fits comfortably and I forget it's on while going through a lesson. In addition, I've only had a couple times where I had to repeat a phrase because it was so off-base the voice recognition program didn't think it would pass as Italian. Now, granted, this may be because the bar is set really low for how authentically I speak Italian; but I would think that with a program teaching Italian as a second language, it would have to be. For most people, it isn't teaching you how to pass as Italian, it's teaching you how to pass IN Italian. And, if the voice recognition program was too fussy, I would get discouraged and just throw it away.Lessons start out with pronunciation, one syllable at a time, spoken and written.  Then vocabulary, spoken and written. Then phrases.  Total immersion, everything is shown on the screen in Italian and spoken in the program in Italian. Occasionally, you have to type in the answer to a question, rather than say the answer.  Everything is accompanied by photos. So your learning is reinforced in three ways:  you hear the phrase spoken, you see the phrase written, and you see a photo illustrating each phrase (a boy running, boys running).  In later lessons you dive into conversations with full sentences.Your Main Menu shows you which lessons you've completed. Based on that, you can access Rosetta Studio, which is practice with real people. Your main menu will tell you if any Rosetta Studio sessions are available at any point in time. You schedule a session and you and other students take part in a session lead by a native Italian speaker.You get a two-disc CD set for additional practice when you're not on the computer. I have used mine in the car, only occasionally feeling silly for ""talking to myself"". There's no voice recognition, of course. You are only repeating what is said on the CD.  The CD is divided into the same chapters as in the computer program, and each chapter starts with pronunciation, then vocabulary and phrases. Good reinforcement, though, I have to concentrate so hard on what is being said on the CD, that it's a little distracting for driving.If you have an iPhone or another iTouch device, you can download a mini-version of the computer program, including photos. I haven't tried that as my phone is a dinosaur.Included with your program is three months access to Rosetta World OnLine. I haven't tried this yet. From what I understand, after you've completed each chapter on the computer program, you are told how many games, stories and activities are available to you on the OnLine center. You can play individual games, or games with other players (learners) logged in, or with a native Italian speaker. Unfortunately, Rosetta World OnLine is only available 8am - 8 pm for me in Pacific Standard Time zone.  Many times I've sat down at the computer after the kids are in bed, and then it's too late.  If you're in the Eastern U.S., it's available from 11 am to 11 pm. After the three month introductory offer is over, you pay a fee, but I actually can't find what the fee will be.Incidentally, Rosetta Stone offers a six-month unconditional money-back gurantee, but according to their website, you have to order it direct from Rosetta Stone. I only checked the price for Rosetta Stone Italian Level 1 and as of writing this review, the price is the same as the price on amazon.I am using this program on a PC XP with no problems.",5.0,Voice Recognition Really Works!,1318464000,"10 13, 2011",Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,1.0,,

There is only one ten-sided die, not two. The actual game box lists the correct components.I think the components are well worth the money. You get a nice set of miniatures (including a dragon), some colorful map tiles, and a few basic dice. The rules booklets are a different approach, and I think an improvement, from the previous versions' use of character sheets. Each player gets their own character information, plus the basic rules, in one booklet. The Dungeon Master gets a booklet for the first adventures and uses the Advanced booklet after that.This game will most likely be reviewed in comparison with its predecessors, the earlier D&D; Basic Game and the D&D; Adventure Game. In comparison to the earlier Basic Game, this set has, on the con side, four fewer miniatures and less interesting-looking dice. On the pro side this set has booklets with more information for each player than just character sheets, character sheets for level 2 in the Advanced Rulebook, and a bigger, bluer dragon.On the true neutral side, the adventures in this set are presented as a series of one-shot excursions, between which the characters return to town. I haven't played them yet, but I'm guessing this will give players the chance to learn more incremently, take breaks, and talk about what just happened in a different way than with the previous set, which had one, long dungeon. But, even the previous set advised a return to town before encountering the final monster.Given the quality of components in the Adventure Game, which has a glossy paper map and counters instead of miniatures, and originally sold for just under US$10, this current set is a bargain at the current price.I like the Adventure Game and I like both versions of the Basic Game. I do not see the Basic Game 2006 as an improvement or enhancement of either of these sets, but simply a different approach. Although you get fewer miniatures and dice without flash, you do get another way to learn the rules. The change from character sheets to booklets, the inclusion of level 2 character sheets, and the separation of the game play into shorter adventures leading to a final, longer adventure are the major changes I see in this latest set. All of these changes give new players a slightly different way to learn the game.As I am interested in games as learning tools, and love to see games whose creators seem to care about making the learning process easier, I thought this Basic Set's focus on changing the pacing of the first adventures and the amount of information given to players was worth the purchase in itself. And, now, my black dragon has someone to fight.For slightly fewer components and an interesting, new approach to learning the game, I give the Basic Game 2006 four stars.Happy gaming.",4.0,"Comparisons are odious, but inevitable",1159401600,"09 28, 2006",Toys_and_Games,1.0,,

Eliot threw a bunch of unconnected quotes and social commentary onto paper and called it The Waste Land, it was hailed as genius by a bunch of literary critics who probably had no clue what Eliot was talking about. When my English teacher tried to teach it in highschool, I fell asleep. Some eighty years later, NOFX pulls together different musical styles and their own social commentary and creates the 18-minute ballad The Decline, which is unlike anything I've ever encountered in punk music. This is punk rock poetry, a melodic hardcore musical masterpiece, and other contradictions all wrapped up in one. In true NOFX fashion, the band went out of their way to be as confusing and surprising as they could possibly be, putting the entire album in one track on a mostly clear CD (that's right, as in see-through). Lyrically, it's loaded with plays-on-words, metaphors, and inside jokes, and even the music has some instances where the band mocks its old material. Covering every range of speed, melody, and sound, NOFX accomplishes exactly what they're best at: being completely unpredictable. The album opens with the same hardcore tone that &quot;So Long and Thanks...&quot; did, but manages to wrap around and apply tons of different styles that the band has tried, and even some that they haven't. Even though I'm biased when it comes to NOFX (if they took a poop in a jewel box I'd probably give it a good review), the album seems to be getting a good response from those who have heard it, and it seems safe to say that this is a step up from their two most recent albums.

I noticed when I was punching out the tiles, there was a lot of debris on the table. Maybe a poor cut in the sheet, but annoying in any event. They also are prone to tearing if you aren't careful when taking them out. But once they are punched out, they seem to be pretty solid. The playing cards are also a bit thinner than other games. Not too big of a deal since most players buy sleeves for all their cards, so that I can live with. Lastly, the adventure book and rule book are pretty flimsy.The minis are of great quality and there are a lot of them. Wizards of the Coast never disappoints in this department IMHO.All in all, if the punch outs are carefully taken out and the cards and books are stored properly, there should be no issue.For a sale price of $38, I couldn't pass this up, but I would be VERY hesitant to pay full blown retail price.Definitely worth picking up for solo adventures or a good solid game night.",4.0,Great dungeon crawler with a few minor complaints.,1372982400,"07 5, 2013",Toys_and_Games,1.0,,

When it finally appeared in 2004, a couple of years after Sackson's death, it went on to win Games Magazine Game of the Year award in 2005, and many consider it a ""modern classic in the making"".  This particular edition is the Face2Face edition, and a deluxe edition also appeared in 2011 courtesy of Gryphon Games.Let's be honest that the genre of word games isn't everybody's cup of tea. But this one is different, because it introduces a simple economy to the game. The letter tiles in the game have dots on them, and the amount of dots in a collection of tiles will determine its buying and selling price. Players first must buy tiles, and then try to sell them at a profit ideally by making large words with lots of dots.The economic element that Sackson has incorporated presents an interesting twist on the traditional point-scoring model associated with most word games, and works really well. It avoids some of the pitfalls associated with Scrabble, which can reward players for knowledge of obscure short words. The game is also very accessible for non-gamers, and has a very broad appeal. It also works outstandingly as a solitaire challenge. In BuyWord, Sid Sackson has produced a word game that deserves to be a modern classic among word games. - EndersGame @ BGG",5.0,A clever and classic word game with an economic element,1327276800,"01 23, 2012",Toys_and_Games,1.0,,

If you get Rosetta Stone you will need to use a Greek Dictionary and have a tutor to help you interpret what is going on.  If you just wing it without, you will never really understand what you are doing.  You have photo's and sentences and words, but there is no explanation as to what Rosetta Stone is doing or why.  In my humble opinion, it would not be too difficult to make a better product than Rosetta Stone.  All you would need to do is offer some explanations as well as use a different format in some cases.  An advantage is found in the use of the text to speech verification.  However, as for the photos, it is a nifty idea, but the TV is a better visual medium then this, and it is no help at all. So photos alone are not the answer, although it is good idea.  Rosetta Stone also has various glitches.  For example, there will be a sentence, and you have to match it with a photo.  After you get the answer correct there is no way to *easily* check to see what was said in writing without going back where all the sentences are flashed off in the beginning.  They also use the same format for every language, I really question how committed they are to teaching the best way for each language.  I hear they throw in TV and other such things in Latin.There is a WIDE MARGIN for improvements here, so keep your eyes open for the next product, I know I will.  In the mean time get some Greek friends and purchase  Total Greek.  When you finished THEN I would say you can go back to Rosetta Stone.  For example to do it the other way around would be such a waste of time I cannot even make a compassion.",1.0,In comparison to Total Greek Michel Thomas,1357603200,"01 8, 2013",Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,0.0,,

While they do stretch fine for moves like an overhead press the bands are very tight which makes each band's weight resistance not accurate when doing these moves.

It says that you can freeze it for 6-22 hours, or until you shake the bowl and can't hear any liquid sloshing around. So, I froze the bowl for 6 hours and sure enough, no sloshing. But, this is simply not enough! My strawberry ice cream tasted wonderful, but in the machine never made it past a thick liquid stage. I had to put it in the freezer for hours to get it hard enough to eat. The texture suffered, but the flavor was still great.The next time I made ice cream, I froze the bowl for two days while I was out of town. I got some really great Kaluha ice cream out of it, and I've bought a second bowl so I'll always have one ready to make frozen treats.When used correctly, this ice cream maker is wonderful!

If you are looking for an all purpose ePad or IPAD alternative, buy another product!  That's clearly not what Barnes and Noble designed this unit for.  It's not intended to surf the web, check email, etc.  It is an eReader...PERIOD!Having said that, in my opinion, it is the best out there right now.  It is incredibly light weight - much lighter than even a typical paperback.  It is easy on the eyes for extended reading periods and can be read in basically every lighting situation you could read a real book.  The clarity is sharp but not overpowering on the eyes like an LCD type display is after a few hours.The battery life is insane.  If you turn off WIFI, which should be normal unless you are looking for another book, the battery doesn't need recharging for weeks on end.  Page turning is a simple touch to the left or right of the screen.  Assignable buttons are also provided for pagination but they require a rather firm press.  I found most of the time I don't use them.It has a very responsive touch screen for all your navigation.  I had a 1st generation Nook and this one is far easier to navigate through books which is a big plus for Bibles or Reference books.

Far too much inconvenience having to undo straps to get to pockets, etc., to be really ergonomic.The materials/construction issues have already hit BOTH packs- and I haven't even gone on the hike yet!!!The 5200, the hem ripped off the water-bottle pocket when I was holding it to push the bottle down further.  The stitching was just too close to the edge of the material, and the border just tore right off.  The 4000, one of the buckles just shattered when I was tightening a strap over the rolled-up sleeping pad.  Clearly not nylon, some kind of more fragile plastic.So, I guess you get what you pay for... maybe these are still a good choice if you just can't afford the higher-end brands... a shame, as some skimping on ergonomic thought, careful construction, and good materials could I think have made these good packs.

While good in concept, this is a poor quality toy. The cardboard pieces may be advertised as ""sturdy laminated paper on board construction"" but they rip easily. Very easily, even with gentle and proper play by age-appropriate children. Also, the scale of the pieces is smaller than you might think.We purchased ours through Land of Nod but it is the same exact Painter's Palette set. I have not yet asked the manufacturer (Mudpuppy) for a replacement but will be sure to update any resolution here if I do.*I will rate 2 stars because somehow the kids still play with this--even though almost all of the pieces have been broken in half, there are still some slots for fitting together--and because encouraging creative building is to be commended. But ultimately, and if I had it to do over again, I would have purchased the similar-in-concept but better-in-execution set from Pottery Barn Kids. It was made of wood and larger in scale, and cost (I think) forty-nine dollars.* UPDATE *September 22The company sent me a refund check even though I said more than once that I would be happy to receive the ""new and improved"" set. My guess is they knew the new set would break just as easily (if there even *is* a new set). Still, I appreciate the refund.

They are great construction quality and they are quite inexpensive as compared to some competing products in the same quality category.I owned other products in the past and while I am not the Schwarzenegger type for sure, I have managed to break through cheap resistance bands causing pain and/or cuts in various areas of my body. Usually the metal rings would give in under tension and the whole band snapped unexpectedly. That's why at first I was a little hesitant to but this brand and was thinking to settle on more expensive product to assure build quality. I was even more worried after closer examination of the pictures, where I've noticed that what keeps the tube connected is nothing less than the infamous metal ring that likes to fail. However the reviews were good and people mentioned that the customer support is good, so I took the plunge.When I received the product, it wasn't packed in any extravagant box or anything like that, so I wasn't sure my OEM tubes would be good after all. But, after inspecting all elements I've realized that the quality seems good overall. The metal elements appeared to be sturdy and of good quality (I would say B+ quality); the tubes looked good and smooth without any defects, and they streached evenly too; and the handles were OK.So far everything seems to be working fine and I'm slowly regaining trust in resistance bands workouts again, just rarely worrying if something will snap again and hit me.... Maybe this time a piece of the doorframe.What I like about these particular bands is that you can stack them in various combinations to create different tension. So as long as your doorframe is sturdy and you look up few exercise ideas on YouTube and other places you can pretty much work out most of your muscle groups with various exercises. It's also less straining on your joints and creates more resistance throughout the whole movement unlike working out with dumbbells.If you never worked out with the bands, then you should know they are big advantage over dumbbells. I think they work better, are more fun to work out with, are easier to store and are defiantly lighter and more portable.

These reviews should be about the learning aspect of RS, not technical difficulties. I have had a couple of minor glitches, but RS customer service was responsive.I understand the methodology. In a nutshell, I feel that even minimal information on verb tenses or sentence structure or article usage would be incredibly helpful. Fortunately, my Austrian friends are there to help me (although they seem to think I'm silly to try to learn German when they are happy to speak English to me when I visit!). One friend sent me to this [...] to help me understand. It was very early on in Level 1 that I was confused by all the endings added on without explanation. Yes, you may pick up the patterns at some point, but a bit of explanation would be easier.That said, there is so much repetition, you need not fear the next lesson. And it is pretty enjoyable on the whole. I grew up hearing a little bit of German/Yiddish, so the pronunciation has been easy for me. I am a bit fanatical about accents, so I want to get it right. I am bugged that occasionally the voices will differ during the lesson. Ex.: the pronunciation lessons for 'und' and 'fahrrad' make clear that you hit the D pretty much like a T; but when the female voice says 'fahrrad,' she says it like a D.  Same with 'und'--the male voice says it as a D in one phrase.It's hard to imagine becoming anywhere near fluent without the rules and such, but I'm reviewing Level 1, so that's not for me to say.The headset is very nice and solid.

They are good, solid quality pieces and the tiles are great stock pieces. If there was one thing I would improve on with this set, it is that the miniatures, while good pieces, could be a bit sturdier. They are normal miniature stock, but for my own personal taste, I prefer the pieces to be a bit more rigid (like in the 1990 MB game Heroquest). That is the only real complaint I have. I ordered the Wrath of Ashardalon and the two Dungeon Commander sets to go along with this game. As an avid RPG player, having the miniatures and the tiles is great, and on game days when we can't think of where to go next, the adventures in the book that comes with the sets can be a great jumping off point to segue into the game session.Overall, I give this game 5 stars and congratulate WotC for putting out a fantastic game.

WIth that said, I am very happy with my purchase thus far. I purchased these bands a little over 3 months ago and have been using them with the P90x exercise videos among other workouts. The bands feel sturdy and well-made. I admit the first few weeks using the door anchor I half feared the bands would break anyway and snap back to slap me in the face (paranoia anyone?), but they held up beautifully. I find myself putting more and more stress on them now (getting further back from the anchor creates stronger resistance) because I know they can take it. I love the option to stack bands on the handles - there are several leg exercises I do that simply require more weight than a single band in this set can give me. Thankfully, the stacking option works great - the bands feel balanced and like I'm getting even resistance from all of them. I would like it if it were easier to attach and detach the bands from the door anchor, but at the end of the day, I'd rather have an anchor that I know will hold up.There are certain exercises that free weights really are better for, but for the most part, I've done great with these bands and just some 5 lb hand weights as a backup. It is also really easy to switch between bands during a workout, which I appreciate since my workout routines tend to move through several muscle areas and then repeat, and it involves a lot of weight switching.

Okay, so not ""Silvergun Superman"" or ""Meat Plow"", flat reworkings of the Core sound. Neither have much personality. I don't really like the slash-and-burn punk song ""Unglued"" either.

It goes from slide-driven delta blues to hard-rock in the verses and choruses. You not only get a dynamic shift (which everyone was doing back then), but a stylistic shift, too! And ""Army Ants"" is a psychedelic hard southern rocker. They even go for a winding, four-minute epic (with hidden track attached, of course) on ""Candybars and Kitchenware"".

If you put them side by side, you notice that the kindle is a fraction of the thickness, turns pages faster, is easier to navigate (mediocre touch screen on the nook), has several times the battery life, and has much better contrast than the nook. The nook does have a slight advantage in terms of ""extras"" with a mediocre internet browsing feature and some small applications like sukdo or chess. However, and this was the real killer for me, the kindle can display word documents natively while the kindle can not. Also, the prices seem to be slightly better on amazon for most of the books I have looked at (Sci-Fi) and amazon's website is much easier to navigate then B&N;'s.The biggest problem though with the nook is barnes and noble. They shipped me a unit with a defective battery and agreed to replace it but never sent it. Three months later, 6 promises to send a battery, a complaint filed with the BBB, and there is still no record of them ever having shipped the battery on their computers aside from the one they sent ""somewhere in colorado"" but can't find any record of what address that might be too. Of course, they stock the batteries in every physical store but you could never simply walk in and pick up the replacement no matter how incompetent their phone support is. From all of my interactions and my friend's experiences with B&N;, this is a common experience with them and undermines whatever they manage to accomplish in terms of producing a decent product.Bottom line: The nook beat the 2nd kindle, but is terrible compared to the 3rd generation of kindle.*note: All software was up to date as of March 2011 on the nook, but still performed worse than the kindle",2.0,Good until compared to a kindle,1301702400,"04 2, 2011",Electronics,0.0,,

That's just fine with me, the flavor is best this way. After freezing whatever is left of the batch, the consistency is like store bought ice cream. I do not do anything fancy with it, just follow the directions in the included booklet for basic vanilla ice cream. In fact, the recipe calls for heavy cream and whole milk but I substitute 1 cup Half & Half and 2 cups low fat (2%) milk to keep it lower cal, and the consistency is still plenty smooth!Like other reviewers have said, be sure to freeze that container for plenty of time before using. Otherwise the ice cream will be real runny. I try to freeze it for 24 hours before use. As long as the directions are followed on this machine, it makes great ice cream every time.

No configuration has been able to get this item to work on the S4.  Every time my GS4 gives a message that it is ""unable to mirror due to hardware failure.""  I have a different MHL adapter that works just fine.  So I know the problem is not with any other components.  It appears that everyone posting reviews has had the same problems and has been unable to get this item to work on the S4.  This item simply does not work.  You have been warned.  If you ignore these reviews and buy this item, then do not complain when it does not work and you have to return it.Buy your MHL adapter elsewhere.*** UPDATE ***I purchased my item from the seller ""ConneVity."" I asked for authorization to return the item and get a refund.  (Most sellers would just approve the authorization, I would ship the item, and they would refund my money.  Not so easy in this case.) ConneVity, to their credit, was very prompt in their responses and their communications were very polite.  However, they were not very helpful.  I feel like I was getting the run-around.  When I asked for a refund they offered an exchange.  They tried to explain to me that the old S3 MHL adapters are the same as the new S4 MHL 2.0 adapters, just that the packaging is different.  When I pointed out how incorrect that was, ConneVity responded with reasons why the old S3 MHL adapter was useful.  Such as how the old S3 adapter can be used on the new S4 and the older S3.  I pointed out that I still wanted a refund because I don't have an S3 and it does NOT work with my S4.  Initially, ConneVity also tried to tell me that nothing was wrong with the item and it was the settings in my S4 that had to be changed.  Twice they said the S4 is not set up to mirror using MHL by default.  I pointed out how that was not true.  My other MHL adapter mirrors with no setting changes, just plug-and-play.  All the video and written tutorials online also demonstrate how the S4 mirrors using MHL by just plugging in the adapter.  I even linked to a written tech tutorial.  Finally, ConneVity admitted that it sounded like the MHL adapter I got was bad.  Now this is when things went from bothersome to truly aggravating.  ConneVity sent me an email containing the following procedure for obtaining a refund.""Requires 100% feedback so I can prove to Amazon it works andthey let me force full refunds for future customers.  Then, I email aprepaid label, you return it, email when sent in the mail and I'll issuea full 100% refund, no Amazon penalty, refund issued within 2 businessdays of return shipping confirmation.""They require that I give them 100% (positive?) feedback in order to get a full refund on an item that does not work.  They say that I need to prove to Amazon that the item works in order to get a refund when I am returning the item BECAUSE it does not work.  (And no one who left a review has been able to get this item to work on the S4.)  They seem to imply that otherwise I will be penalized by Amazon.  Is that a threat?  You read the message and decide for yourself.  Either way, I do not trust this seller so I went directly to Amazon to verify the truth of the procedure given to me.  I just wanted to know if any of this was actually true.  The Amazon representative who responded was kind enough to file one of Amazon's ""A-Z Guarantee"" claims for me and is contacting the seller directly!  Amazon also filed a claim with their Seller investigation team because ConneVity's return policy violates Amazon's community rules.At one point, ConneVity was even signing their emails as ""Amazon.com for ConneVity"" to make it look like I was actually dealing with Amazon employees.  Amazon representatives assured me the person I was talking with was the seller.  Just constant tricks and dishonesty.Just trying to save everyone else a headache.***UPDATE***Again, seller was ConneVity.  Amazon issued a full refund in the form of a gift card, told me to throw out the adapter, stop all communication with the seller, and let Amazon handle it.  (Amazon can always be trusted to do the right thing for customers.  Thank you Amazon.)  Yet seller still contacted me and tried to trick/scare me into editing and removing my feedback.  I contacted Amazon, and Amazon representatives informed me that pretty much everything the seller told me was false.  Sara, ConneVity's owner, emailed me that ConneVity (and I paraphrase) ""deserves better feedback under Amazon's feedback agreement and Amazon expects me to remove or edit my feedback.""  Amazon confirmed there is no such thing as a ""feedback agreement"" and I do not have to remove or edit anything.  In fact, the Amazon representative filed another claim with Amazon's seller investigation team because ConneVity's communications violated Amazon's community rules.ConneVity spent 3 paragraphs trying to make me feel guilty and trick me into removing my negative (but deserved) feedback.  Long-story-short, Amazon assured me nothing ConneVity said was true.  Amazon said the communication was cause for investigation and could be cause for ConneVity's removal from Amazon.  Most importantly, be very careful when dealing with this seller.  I advise just shopping elsewhere.",1.0,BUYER BEWARE - POSTING IS A LIE!,1369872000,"05 30, 2013",Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,0.0,,

After freezing the bowl, you simply pour in your ice cream base (generally milk, cream, eggs and vanilla) and turn it on. It is loud, but it IS an ice cream maker...besides, for 15 minutes, can we not just deal? About 5 minutes before finishing, you add your goodies--chocolate chips, candy pieces, etc. I recommend freezing your creation another 1-2 hours afterward because the consistency can be somewhat like ice milk right away. The ice cream is even better 2-3 days letter if left frozen and covered.Ice cream recipe books are a good compliment, but plenty of recipes are also available online at various places. Overall, I give this my highest recommendation. For the price, you can't beat it. The finished product is excellent and easily created.

I had images of ice and rock salt in my head (I wasn't very excited about it).  I knew there had to be a better way to make ice cream.  My sister had given me a book with homemade ice cream recipes in it last year.  My husband and children love ice cream, so I decided to go for it.  Sure enough Cuisinart had a ""better"" ice cream machine.  The Cuisinart ICE-20 is SO easy to use!  The ice cream recipes vary from simple (combine ingredients and chill) to slightly more advanced (heat some ingredients to make a custard, then chill).  It's SO much fun watching the ingredients go from liquid to solid, and tasting it along the way.  The machine itself has only 4 pieces (no ice or rock salt), and is EASY to assemble.  It's also quiet enough that my children (ages 7 and 5) sleep through it on hot summer evenings when I decide to make a batch to surprise them with in the morning.  So far I've made Vanilla, Strawberry and Cookies and Cream.  I keep the bowl in the freezer so I can whip up a batch whenever I want.  The homemade ice cream disappears so quickly that I just keep making more and more.  I'm looking forward to the next flavor to try - coffee, mint chocolate chip, lemon sherbet - so many to choose from.  This machine also makes sorbets, frozen yogurt and frozen drinks - Mmmm!

My other Suunto watches are still going strong, easily after ten years - just wanted a change of look really.I'm not sure what problems other users have had with their watches and water, but I've had this watch for several months and had no problems with the waterproof of it (even swam in the ocean, lakes, and pools and had no problems at all). I was afraid of this when I read their reviews, but mine is great and don't worry about it too much.Contrast face is a little harder to read when compared to other faces, but for me it's worth the cool look and not a problem overall. The straps are a little less thick and stiff when compared to my ten year old Advizor, wish they were more stiff so the tail strap doesn't come out as often.Overall GREAT watch for good price, got what I expected from a great company like Suunto.

On paper, I consider it the best 7"" tablet for the price. A wonderful display, quick and responsive, micro SD slot...up to 32 gig and 16 gig on board with an Android OS and only $250! Now, the reality, at least according to me. I was very happy with the screen quality and the responsiveness of the unit. 16gig of on board memory...ha! 15gig of that memory is reserved for ONLY material purchased from Barnes and Nobel. You only have 1 gig to install your own media. That's about 200 mp3s or about 45min of mp4 video. That's right! Even though you bought 16gig of data space, Barnes and Nobel is holding 15gig of it for ransom! Now for the micro SD slot. The Nook manual says it supports class 6. I tried a 16gig class 10 and a 32gig class 4 card and had video playback problems with both cards (less with the class 4). I also had some mp3 playback problems with the class 4 card. The Nook had occasional problems even identifying the class 4 card. I have yet to track down a class 6 card at a local vendor. I have no conclusion on this matter, though there are possibilities. There is no flexibility, a class 6 card is the only option (good luck finding a 32gig class 6 card...I am aware that a class 10 card should be compatible, just function as a class 6 card...that's just the tech side of me talking, I know it doesn't always work that way). It is also possible that the micro SD slot is just crappy and there'll be problems with any card. As for the Android OS...not really. This ia a Barnes and Nobel custom version of Android. That means that ONLY apps found on the Barnes and Nobel site are available. The Nook will block apps from any other source. All preloaded apps cannot be deleted. Look over the apps on the Barnes and Nobel site to see if you're satisfied with the choices, I wasn't. That's about it.",2.0,The Nook Tablet,1322611200,"11 30, 2011",Electronics,0.0,,

I should have paid more attention to the negative reviews that seem to be quite consistent.  The lack of a truly grippy rubber surface is disappointing.  Especially since this feature, i.e. not sliding off of a smooth surface, is one of the main reasons I selected this case model.  Well the rubber is not only less grippy and thin than I'd like, the back of the case is arched in a slight but noticeable ^ that means the most of the surface area that contacts is actually slick and smooth, thereby negating the traction altogether.  Even worse is the distortion from the flash while taking photos.  The shot is completely hazed.  What idiot designed this?  Who needs a case that must be removed every time you want to take a flash shot. And its not easy to remove at that.

This is just as easy as running to the store and buying a carton of additive-packed ice cream. Freeze the bowl, mix your ingredients, fire it up, add your mixture, blend-blend-blend, ice cream. The owner's manual comes with many recipes and with sites like Pinterest I have discovered many more. One of my favorites is 1 cup frozen pink lemonade concentrate, 3 cups milk, and 3 tbsp Splenda for a tangy frozen treat. I use fat free milk, so I tend to get 'icier' blends than using full fat milk for creamier results, but softening at room temp for a minute or two makes it very easy to scoop and a batch lasts about a week (mostly because it is my daily treat). A tip: do not use a metal sppon to scrape the bowl, it will leave unsightly scratch marks.

I seen this game on Amazon and although it's from 2006 I just had to have it for the price, (under $[...]).

I learned that the world of D&D; seemed to have more than one variation of D&D; games, and this game was geared to teach you the basics of ""D&D; Miniatures"" and comes with everything to get you and some friends a good base to start at. You get a 12 miniature figures of Heroes, Monsters and a cool Blue Dragon. 4 booklets for each Hero and a basic Dungeon Master booklet, dice, dungeon tiles, 1 sheet of counters - doors, chests etc. made of glossy cardboard, a getting started 1pg sheet and an Advanced Rule book. This being my 1st D&D; game I think it has everything to get you started and if you like it you will have a good foundation to move on to other versions of the game. I also bought this game:Dungeons & Dragons Roleplaying Game Starter Set (D&D; Introductory Game), which is similar except it starts on the new version D&D; 4 and has cardboard discs instead of the minitures. I have been reading through each set and I think for the price I got much more than I expected, and look forward to get on with playing them.

You also need to have a stud finder).- Well fabricated- Mount does everything advertised (i.e. articulates - you made need to loosen up some nuts)Con's: Really stretching here since this is a good deal: Instructions could use some help for the ""novice"" DIY'ersInstall tip:  It really helps if you have a second person assisting you for the final step of mounting the flat panel to the TV mountInstalled a 15.5 lbs, 26 Inch Flat Panel LCD (VESA 200mm X 100mm) to this mount. Mount works beautifully! I originally had the TV sitting a little high on a stand, but then the picture was not as good because of the upward viewing angle of the screen (inherent problem with cheaper LCD's - not being directly in front of a LCD screen) - this mount corrected this issue by allowing me to ""tilt down"" the screen.  I would strongly recommend this mount if you are in the market.",5.0,Outstanding Articulating Wall Mount!,1347494400,"09 13, 2012",Electronics,1.0,,

Thankfully, I'm not like most people my age.For a brief moment I wanted to get the iPad because of one reason, I wanted to read magazines. Then I realized that a device the could carry all of my books as well as my stacks of magazines would be a ideal for me. That's where the Kindle and Nook Color came in...Some people think it's a matter of either or when it comes to these two products, but I think we need both on the market. So this is what it comes down to:If you are a serious, die-hard ereader who wants to read for hours on-end without getting tired or outdoors without glare, then the Kindle is the best choice for you. It's eInk looks so incredible you will find it hard to believe it's a tablet and not a real page. And if that wasn't enough the battery can last up to a month!I came VERY close to getting this great product, but then I tried the Nook Color...The Nook Color can only be described in one word, PERFECTION! Some people don't like the weight of it but I actually do, it might be heavier than the Kindle but it's more durable and better to hold this way. To be honest, the Kindle was so lightweight that at times it feels like it will snap in half. The Nook Color's screen is unbelievably beautiful, it's clear, crisp, and simply stunning. Book covers look amazing sitting on the shelf in your library and magazines will blow you away. This is why it beats the iPad on every level; its better for reading ebooks, better for reading magazines, and it's much more portable. As a student my messenger bag is already heavy enough because of all my textbooks, the last thing I need is a bulky, 9 inch, heavy tablet like the iPad. Not too mention it's insane price tag, I can barely afford textbooks so throwing $500 at Steve Jobs is not an option. That's why I decided I'd rather have an ereader under my tree this year instead of an over-sized, glorified iPod Touch (especially when I already have an iPod Touch.) But ereaders like the Nook Color and Kindle are perfect for people like me.The Nook store has every book the Kindle store does, (so far from what I've seen), and they get more ebooks and magazines on a regular basis. And the interactive children's books are great for reading stories to my nephews and niece. Plus the Nook Color designer covers are the perfect addition to you Nook, they can be a bit pricey but they are attractive and well-made, a great investment! And for those of you who think it might be hard/tricky to figure out just hang in there, the set-up vids that play straight away are really helpful and will explain whatever the instruction booklet might have left out.So if you want to read books, look at magazines, listen to your music, read interactive children's books, view your photo albums all in a tablet that's actually the weight and size of a real book then buy the Nook Color! So might have to sacrifice the eink and the long battery life, but trust me it's well worth it, you won't regret getting the Nook Color.",5.0,$250 = eReader PERFECTON!!!,1293753600,"12 31, 2010",Electronics,1.0,,

That was about the extent of my D&D; experience and my wife didn't even have that much.To make it short, we love the game! We played it nearly every night for about a month and our lack of experience with D&D; gaming was not an issue at all. We loved it so much I bought the sequel game Wrath of Ashardalon and we started playing it last night.It's a brutal game and we lose a lot, but that's what makes the victories worthwhile. The rulebook is kept fairly simple, which is good for the casual gamer. It might frustrate people who want to have every possibility covered in the rulebook, but we found that this lack of specificity encourages people to come up with their own ""House Rules"" that cover some of those special circumstances that aren't covered in the rules. We enjoy the creativity that this allows the players to use while playing. In addition, the game is different every time you play it, making the replayability a huge plus. It also allows you to create your own adventures/scenarios.On a final note, all the game pieces, cards, etc are excellent. They are very sturdy and durable, much more so than the average board game.If you like cooperative games in a fantasy setting, give this game a chance.",5.0,Lots of fun and don't have to be an RPG gamer,1330214400,"02 26, 2012",Toys_and_Games,1.0,,

However, that is no problem -- I made thick, fluffy mayonnaise and nearly accidentally pureed some celery and onion by just pulsing with the blunt blade.

Cutler ""DM for 30+ years""","[7, 10]","This ""miniature"" is one of the biggest ever that is still to scale with the standard D&D; sized minis. The construction is well-done, as is the paintjob, and it depicts a truly massive red dragon quasi-rearing up as if to strike downward or to breathe a gout of flame (more on that in a moment).I've already had the chance to pull this big boy out and use it in game (a PC shapechanged into a colossal red dragon), and it is quite impressive when actually placed on a battle mat and set against other figures. The weirdest thing is that it makes the gargantuan black dragon, which, when I first got it, seemed immense, now look positively puny!Those are the good points of the mini. But there are two bad points. The first is important IMO. For reasons I cannot quite understand, they made the mini the wrong size. Yep. A colossal red dragon is supposed to be 30 ft square. This one is 40 ft square. Now, as some have pointed out, the definition of colossal in the Monster Manual says colossal creatures are AT LEAST 30 ft square, but can be bigger. But the red dragon entry in the Monster Manual only lists 30 ft square as the proper size of a colossal red dragon.Can I, as a DM, rationalize an extra 10 ft? Yeah. But it is still an annoying thing...and sometimes even more. As a DM I might have designed a cavern or dungeon to fit a colossal red dragon and made the halls 30 ft wide. Oops! Now my red dragon mini doesn't even fit in my dungeon! It also distorts the reach of the dragon. A 30 ft square dragon with reach threatens many fewer squares than a 40 ft square dragon with reach. This can make a large difference in combat.But really, the increase simply seems unecessary. Why did WOTC make it bigger than the proper size? What compelling reason was there to do this?

Pulling a boa constrictor snake named Mathilda out of your backpack can make a remarkable first impression! This book is about three best friends Elias, Honoria, and Shohei, who are united against ""That Which Is The Peshtigo School"". Their goal is to make it through the annual school science fair, but things don't always go as planned.Elias is part of a family made up of science fanatics who would do anything to win a science fair. Elias isn't exactly what you'd call the ambitious type, especially when it comes to science fairs. So he becomes like Galileo and ""retests"" one of his sibling's past projects. Honoria loves to be ambitious, especially when it comes to being a legal counsel extraordinaire. But when she faces a bigger challenge than beating Goliath Reed or getting a piranha to become vegetarian, she doesn't know if she can make it. Shohei is an all around slacker who tries to mooch off Elias instead of creating something on his own. His adoptive parents are constantly encouraging him to start ""hearing"" his ancestors. His mom has even turned Shohei's room into what looks like a walk-in Japanese museum exhibit!This book is laugh out loud hilarious and the more you read, the more exciting and unexpected it gets. I love the title on this book because it really made me laugh and want to read the book. I also like how people so different from one another can be such close friends.

Hendrex ""Rubicon""","[2.0, 2.0]","This is a simple and quick solution for converting Computer Video and Sound to an old fashioned cathode ray tube TV.I own an old Sony Trinitron TV, which was tops in it's day, but completely obsolete in today's world.  Although this TV has been left behind by technology, there is actually nothing wrong with it - the picture and sound are as great as they always were.  It sits in our basement entertainment center, connected to an old DVD player, and an even older VCR.  I mainly used it for exercise videos and to allow my grandchildren to watch movies without disturbing the entire house.However I thought we could get better use from the Old Sony and wanted to use it for streaming Amazon Instant videos.  I didn't know exactly how to accomplish this, so I took it to my local office store and asked one of their computer tech guys to recommend something to convert PC to CRT, making it possible to view computer tv programs and movies on the old Sony Trinitron.  They didn't have the correct set up in the store, so we went online right at the service desk and searched Amazon for a solution.After reviewing several possibilities, we decided that this gadget would do the trick, and I ordered it online there and then.  I didn't know if it would really work, but at this price it was worth a try.  It arrived within a week, and was simple, straightforward and effective!  Everything was included, and it was all very easy to do.  The instructions were brief - they didn't need to be longwinded because the set up is so seamless and idiot - proof.  First, I found an unused input on the TV and plugged in the red/white/yellow plugs on the converter.  Then I attached the appropriate connections to my laptop and turned everything on.  Voila!  The TV became and instant computer monitor and speaker for my computer.  I proceeded to play a movie on Amazon instant video and everything worked like a charm.Now when anyone in the house wants to watch a computer movie on a big TV screen, all they have to do is connect to this great and inexpensive converter!  The flat screen TV we have in the family room will do this without a converter, but who wants the whole house filled with the noise of movies and TV programs playing all the time.  It is nice to have a place that is not so central where people can watch programs without disturbing everyone in the house.  And I like having access to the exercise videos that are available online.This is everything I like in a computer device - it is simple and reliable.

The screen resolution and quality was really gorgeous, more pixel resolution than most, a great value considering how cheap this tablet now is! The dual core processor was noticeably a little slow, not nearly a s fluid as the Nexus 7 I now have with it's quad core processor. People who say that quad core is only necessary for gaming are mistaken, it effects everything, such as waiting time between opening and closing apps, returning to the home screen, loading web pages, even how fluid you can navigate from page to page of your apps.At $150-180 this is still a great value even with a slower processor and the exclusion of the Amazon App store (which is home to the majority of my already purchased apps) The real shame it the heating issue.Within a week I returned my first Nook because it kept overheating and force shutting down. I returned it for a new one in hopes that it was a fluke, but two days later had the same overheating issues. The XDA Developer forums seem to agree that many Nook HD + tablets have heating issues due to it's microprocessor in the lower left side of the device...exactly where mine would heat up before shutting itself down.This was obviously a pretty huge design flaw. I tried two different tablets and both were force shutting down just about every other day due to regular use....not playing graphics heavy games.

The top of the line goes to about 3000mAh, but the price jump for such quality is substantial, search for Panasonic 18650's and you'll see what I mean.  These have 1850mAh tested capacity, which is actually pretty good for this price. Your price may vary, see dealer for details....  ;)I went through 14 different vendors/brands and only found FOUR that were 1800mAh or above, the rest were counterfeit. What does counterfeit mean? It means that if you cut it open (don't do that) you will find a bunch of sawdust (or similar filler material) and then you will find a very tiny AAA sized battery stuck inside this huge empty 18650 shell, with leads soldered to the positive and negative terminals. No kidding.

Lets take a look.COMPONENTSThe board is completely functional.  Your player markers are completely functional.  The cards are OK.  Some of the text on them is a bit small and difficult for people not right next to them to read.  Money is cardboard chits and are a bit weird, but once you get used to which shape/size is what value, it's good enough.  Everything else?  Cubes.  Warriors?  Cubes.  Wizards?  Cubes.GAMEPLAYYou take turns placing your workers which let you take quests or resources to complete those quests and/or draw/play cards, and then if you can/want to, you then spend resources to complete one of your quests.  Completing a quest gives you points and many times, more resources to spend later.  Additionally, you can take an action to &#34;buy&#34; a new action space to be put on the board (which you can take or, if anyone else takes it, you get a kickback for owning it).Additionally, there are some hidden bonuses for completing certain types of quests (each player has different hidden goals).  What it really ends up meaning is, if you're lucky and can get goals which don't have a lot of competition (so others aren't taking your quests) and are lucky enough for your type of quests to show up as being available, you get a few extra points.  It's generally not game-altering.All in all, the gameplay is very solid.  My only problem with the gameplay is the cards.  Far too many of them are very &#34;take that&#34; play against one other player.  So if you're in the lead, get ready to get &#34;blue shelled&#34; quite a bit.  As a lighter game, that's not the worst thing in the world.THEMEThe theme is recruiting a small army to go on quests and do cool things, which will look familiar to those familiar to the D&D; lore.  In reality, the game always seems to come down to people paying attention to nothing but colors of cubes to collect and colors of cubes on the cards.  If the cubes were meeples of what they were representing, it would be much easier to feel the theme.  If the different types of quests actually felt different, that would help as well.  As is, it just feels like collecting resources to complete your shopping list.  The theme is a major letdown.CONCLUSIONIf you look at the reviews on Amazon for this game, you'll see literally nothing below 3 stars.  And you know why that is?  It's impossible to hate this game.  Unfortunately, if you know the better options for this type of game, you'll realize it's not easy to love, either.  The mechanics are mostly sound, but there's nothing that stands out anywhere.  The theme isn't there.  And there's better options for simpler worker placement games (The Manhattan Project, Alien Frontiers) to use to teach newer board gamers.

His biographies inform us that a young Glenn Gould was mesmerized upon witnessing Josef Hoffmann in concert, and walked around in a kind of trance days afterwards. Well, I shared this experience during Cherkassky's concerts in the 80's, Hofmann, one of his teachers, could have been proud.Unfortunately, Cherkassky's quality of tone, about which libraries could be filled to little avail, is poorly reproduced in most of his recordings. His Nimbus discs are disastrous, his concert discs on Decca, Orpheo and BBS legends are decent, but offer very little in the way of the Cherkassky live experience. Fortunately, there is this disc that should be able to give an uninitiated listener at least some impression of the singing tone that the master could produce on any hall's standard issue.Just like Jorge Bolet, whose late Liszt cycle has endowed him with a distinctly better chair in the pianist pantheon, Cherkassky found his highest acclaim towards the end of a distinguished career. He started out a prodigy, found fame, was forgotten and survived under humble circumstances as the BBC house pianist, to reemerge in the 1980s and find well deserved acclaim.Whereas the likes of Ivo Pogorelich and Bruno Leonardo Gelber never failed to express the attitude ""my audience, I despise you""; never more so when one attempted to even approach their dressing room, Shura was the very opposite. He knew who he was and was the most pleasant of after concert personalities. I remember discussing the Beethoven/Liszt symphony transcriptions that Katasaris was recording at that time with him. He responded ""o, that is such a bad idea, those works don't work at all on a piano; and, ""the Liszt version of Berlioz' Symphonie Fantastique, now that is a much better idea"". However, my question ""have you ever played it"" only got one of his gentle ""are you crazy"" smiles in response.In his Cherkassky obituary Stephen Hough wrote: ""no one who heard him play or met him will ever forget his unique personality, both on and off the stage. His golden tone, like sunshine melting a bowl of the richest ice-cream (two of his 'favourite things'); his contrapuntal voicing, like a child wandering into all the rooms he's been banned from; or, for that matter, his walk to the piano - as if treading on crushed velvet. We will try to keep our memories fresh with his recordings (particularly the 'live' ones), and will treasure amongst ourselves the many anecdotes which have now become part of musical folklore. Although he never taught (""I wouldn't know how""), perhaps we can all learn from him the lesson that elegance and entertainment have their place in the concert hall as well as education and elevation; and that there is no shame in loving and cherishing the piano for its own sake.""And, although Cherkassky could wrap his arms around a Liszt sonata, the Tchaikovsky Sonata included on this disc, or other large scale works, his mastery was best attuned to both smaller scale works, or segmentable works like variations and paraphrases.It was in one of the after concert conversations that in response to a tease by what appeared a longtime friend Cherkassky responded ""well, look at my repertoire, it ranges from Lully to Stockhausen, and a lot of what is in between"". That was interesting, and after spending quite some time in those pre-internet days, I was disappointed to find out that there were no such things as Lully solo keyboard works. Two decades later, this disc came to the rescue.Technically this disc is so, so. It's a live concert with a lot of audience noise. There is tape hiss. Dynamics at the macro level are ok, on the micro level leave a lot to be desired, but timbre wise this disc is not bad at all.The concert starts with Lully. Now, in the internet age, I found out that the ""suite de Pieces"" that Cherkassky played is in fact the pianist's selections from an early 20th century transcription of Lully Opera pieces for the piano. Those interested should be able to find the score as a free download without trouble.In many interviews Cherkassky has admitted that sitting on a podium in front of an audience took him to a places that he would have never imagined during practice sessions, and that relistening to concert recordings often resulted in a ""did I really play it that way?"" response. Well, his Lully here is a fine example. Fine that is, for those who do not suffer from HIPP hang ups, since they may counter that Cherkassky's trance-like performance channels good old Beelzebub. But, and this is very relevant for Lully, the French state ""c'est le ton qui fait la musique"", and it is his pretty much unmatched tone control that enables Cherkassky's to open emotional doors, that don't budge for the great majority of his colleagues. Sure, one could remark that this performance -remember Hough's ""his contrapuntal voicing, like a child wandering into all the rooms he's been banned from"" - is pathologically anachronistic. But, that gently perfumed ""Air tendre"" represents the composer more credible than many a card carrying HIPP vinegar factory. To me, this Lully is amazing. And, admiration for this interpretation really blooms when one climbs behind the 88 with the score. Talk about artistic imagination.Mendelssohn's decidedly third-tier piano trifles were popular in Cherkassky's generation. He makes out of it what he can, but this Scherzo and Cappriccio has never impressed me.Next, we get to the meat and potatoes of this disc, the nowadays mostly forgotten Tchaikovsky sonata. It's sad Pjotr wrote so much great music, and yet when it comes to the piano all we hear is that mediocre 1st Piano Concerto war horse. In many respects, this sonata is much more interesting. Of course, a Hammerklavier it's not, but judged on its own especially melodic merits there is a lot to enjoy. The pianist has this music running through his veins and in all likelihood offers us a very close approximation of what Tchaikowsky had in mind. Not surprisingly, the interpretation is approached from the inside out, from detail to the whole -Leslie Howard offers an engagingly opposite approach. And, the romantically inclined among us will find a lot to enjoy in this neglected work.Next, there is Chopin's Op. 61, which may be considered among the composer's very best and most dramatic works. Although I don't want to imply that it represented a certain dislike of the dramatic, Cherkassky's performance here is in a much lighter vein than Ivan Moravec' standard performance. Just like he did in his Salzburg performance of Bach's 6th Partita, Cherkassky provides a more laid back approach that does not lack in validity. Chopin's masterpiece does lose some of its bite, but this lyrical approach successfully highlights the more subtle of the composer's modulations in a beautiful tone.Then there are two encores, an old school Chopin waltz that defines the word ""charm"" concludes the affair. Before that there is Hoffman's Kaleidoskop, that has been revived by Marc-Andre Hamelin. The Canadian is linear and metronomically incredibly perfect. Just like in Lully, Cherkassky dives into the piece, and uses his exquisite sense of coloring to get to this composition's true essence.Bolet and Cherkassky both enjoyed the label ""the last romantic"" at the end of their careers. Comparing them to today's highly homogenized lot turns even me nostalgic. Fortunately, this disc seves like the madeleine in ""&Agrave; la recherche du temps perdu"".",5.0,An adequate representation of a unique pianist,1401926400,"06 5, 2014",Sports_and_Outdoors,1.0,,

I've had my Nook for 7 months now and this problem has gotten worse over time.  I spoke w/ a tech support person once who was no help, then a second who said I needed a replacement.  A few days later I received a replacement, pretty quick, impressed; until I opened the box and found a CERTIFIED PRE-OWNED NOOK.  When I called customer support, they couldn't give me a straight answer about why that happened but with all the nonsensical things they told me, I deduced that it is Barnes and Noble policy to send certified pre-owned replacements to replace a defective unit. After several attempts I finally was able to talk to a manager who confirmed that policy.  If your Nook malfunctions beyond 30 days of purchase, you will receive a used Nook.  Even w/ an extended warranty, which by the way, in the store, I was told I'd get a brand new replacement, apparently the extended warranty only covers you for a certified pre-owned previously defective Nook.The Nook Color is great, as long as it is working properly.

I remember that we never succeeded at making ice cream.  The result of a half hour of concocting and endlessly turning the crank was an unfrozen milk mixture that had many large frozen ice crystals in it that was hardly recognizable as ice cream.  It was more like what you get when you accidentally let store bought ice cream thaw completely and then re-freeze it.Naturally, I was a bit skeptical about this when I saw it showcased on Amazon's front page.  After reading many rave reviews and checking out what else was available in the ice cream maker arena, I gave it a shot.  I was pleasantly surprised when after about 25-30 minutes of spinning I got ice cream that was about the consistency of soft serve.  The amazing thing was how good it tasted, especially if you knew how limited my cooking skills are.  The ice cream maker is still my favorite way to mate dessert even after a year.  Definitely worth every last dollar.A few suggestions:  Ice cream and any frozen dessert you may make freezes best if you either use chilled ingredients for recipes that involve no cooking, and when they do need heating it helps quite a lot to thoroughly chill the mixture to near freezing before transferring to the device.  Being a chemist, the approach I naturally took was the same as in lab: put a smaller container (mixing bowl) with the hot ice cream mixture inside a bigger container (slightly larger mixing bowl of the same shape) filled with about two or three dozen ice cubes + water.  If one stirs the mixture every few minutes, it's ready to freeze in no time.If the result of the ice cream maker is not solid enough in the suggested freezing time of 20-25 minutes, I've found that letting it mix up to about a maximum of 40-45 minutes continues to harden your frozen dessert. (Coincidentally, there seems to be an auto shut-off at that same time - presumably to prevent burning out the motor) Beyond that sitting 2-3 hours in the freezer will give you completely solid ice cream.Also I suggest taking the time to try to cook a custard.  It may take more than one attempt to get it right, but if you do the treat is well worth it.  Vanilla custard is by far my favorite ice cream now and no store bought ice cream can compare!  There's a recipe for Philly soft serve that's great as well and is not as tricky (recipes for both were found in a book called Frozen Desserts by Caroline Liddell).  A friend of mine apparently found the ideal way to cook a custard with such an ice cream maker.  He apparently got his hands on an old hot plate with a magnetic stirrer that was being tossed at his lab.  He says it works great: you set the thermostat to the right number, turn on the stirrer and it maintains a constant 180 degrees Fahrenheit just like in lab.  And your custard is done cooking in 15 minutes with virtually no risk of curdling by overheating.  Now if only I could find one of those on its way to the junk yard!",5.0,Who needs Ben & Jerry's anymore?,1029110400,"08 12, 2002",Home_and_Kitchen,1.0,,

These knives are not stainless steel as advertised. The knives have been treated with care and used as per manufacturers instructions (not put in the dishwasher). Not what you expect from this type of product. I bought the knife End Sept and they started staining within 6 weeks of use.Update : I called the manufacturer at Shun. These blades have a high carbon content, any residual moisture (from cleaning or food) left on the blade they will result in them rusting and staining. The knives need to be completely dried after use. The manufacturers warranty does not extend to rust and staining. As such the stainless steel is not stainless. When asked if this was a common problem they didn't deny it. They have advised me to send the knives back for inspection but do not guarantee a repair on the staining. Shipping would be at my cost but Shun will return at their own cost.From the Shun website FAQs:SHUN KNIVES ARE STAINLESS STEEL, SO WHY IS THERE RUST ON MY BLADE? IS RUST COVERED UNDER WARRANTY?Stainless steel knives can still develop rust. Rust is caused by moisture left on the blade. Rust is not a manufacturing defect and is not covered under warranty. To remove rust from steel, we recommend a product named Flitz. Flitz is a blue gel which helps remove rust, stains, and corrosion from steel. If you decide to use the product, use it only on the areas directly affected by rust. We recommend not letting the Flitz sit on the blade steel for any length of time. After applying the Flitz and removing the rust, please wash your knife thoroughly with warm, soapy water, completely dry it with an absorbent material cloth or towel, and finish with a light coating of cooking-grade oil on the blade and handle cap of the knife. Specific instructions on how to use the Flitz product are available on the Flitz container. Our instructions are not intended to either supplement or surplant the directions of the Flitz manufacturer.I have owned Zwilling and Global knives for over 15 years and never had a problem with them (similar to the above).Best avoid these knives unless you can show them the necessary care and attention.

Biggest disappointment, they want you to charge the batteries 12 full hours before using. I'm sure everyboby is doing that, ha ha. Even though I followed instructions the best play time I've gotten is appr. 3 hours. They send you a second set of batteries, but they have to be charged in the unit so I usually keep recharging the same 4 over and over unless I have say 16 hours between uses. I've got 1400 songs on mine and still have appr. 300 mg left. It plays beautifully, the sound is great, downloading is a snap. The biggest quirk I have found is when setting up a playlist I spend a few minutes doing that, it plays the first song or so and then says the playlist is empty. Other times it plays for hours so I haven't figured that out yet. Each time you gear up it takes more than a minute to load the library, a bit annoying. One of my biggest deals is with Creative, I have e-mailed them a question a month ago and have yet to receive a reply. The unit runs on 12 volt DC. The AC adapter puts out 12.29 volts DC. I ask them if I could run the unit on a standard cigarette lighter wich puts out appr. 14 volts wth the vehicle running. Haven't tried it yet, don't want to burn up This $500. toy just yet. I recommend it, but it needs longer battery life, tech support that will answer your questions and it will be hard to beat.

He couldn't to get it to work properly after he bought a book online.  He made numerous trips to a Barnes and Noble retail store where no one helped.  Finally, after going back yet again to see the Nook ""expert"" they made some software upgrades and it sort of worked.  He was so dissatisfied that he was ready to throw it out.  So I said I would take it.  I then had a similar experience--trips back to B&N;, nice staff who tried to help but couldn't and a dysfunctional product. At my last visit, I was told that if they were really going to help me I needed to bring it in WITH my computer. I use a desktop for my downloaded books.I still have the receipt, but they won't let me return it because the various efforts we made to get it working took so long.  They say that the device isn't defective--it just doesn't really work.  It works much better in the store than at home.  I think they have a much faster wireless connection in the store, which explains why it seemed to work there, but it doesn't work with my desktop or our laptops via WiFi. Not only is it hard to download books, when I do download older books they are usually unreadable because of problems in rendering the .pdfs on the screen.I wasted another day trying to get library books to work--setting up accounts and files, tinkering with the settings etc.I finally gave up and got a Kindle DX.

It was required as an annual donation to the temple. During the time of Christ, Jerusalem was occupied by the Romans and they circulated their own coinage, but Jewish authorities required the half shekel of Tyre as payment of the temple tribute.

I actually think it is more comfortable to hold my S4 with this case on than without. The little kickstand seems flimsy, so I don't use it in fear that it will break off. The battery on this case will do about a 70% charge, they make cases with bigger batteries but those are also bulky and heavy. The battery is only rated at 500mAh, so it does take a while to charge the phone. You can charge the case and battery at the same time by switching on the power for the case while it is plugged in, but ONLY do this with a 500mA charger!! If you use the S4's stock 2A charger, it will get extremely hot, which can destroy the battery or possibly damage the phone. You can also connect the phone to your computer through USB while the case is on, you just have to turn on the battery with the power button. My only complaint is that the LED's are extremely bright. I like to lay in bed and read the news on my phone, and I have to turn the case off because the lights are blinding/distracting.Overall, it is a great product for the money, it is sturdy, comfortable, and best of all it gets me through the entire day of heavy phone use!

It is a moderately complex game, particularly for players who have never played a fantasy role playing game.  After playing a solo adventure and a group adventure, the game mechanics and rules are straight forward and easy to remember.  It is still a hard game to win.Castle Ravenloft is a very large game with lots of pieces.  It comes with more than 40 unpainted miniatures as well as dozens more dungeon tiles, cards, tokens, etc.  There are more than a dozen adventures in the adventure book.  With the random dungeon creation and the various hero arraignments, it has great replay value.The quality of the game seems first rate.  The dungeon tiles and tokens are made of thick cardboard.  Take care in punching the pieces out of their cardboard frames and they should last a long time.  The unpainted miniatures are made of plastic.  A few of the miniatures have bent weapons or other parts that should be straight.The rules are spread across the rule book, the scenario book and the various game cards.  It takes a few plays to get the game play down.  If you don't know what a particular marking on a dungeon tile means, ignore it, as it most likely is explained/used in a later adventure.This game seems to be designed for future expansion and customer content.  Following the pattern of the existing adventures, heroes, monsters and villains, it's fairly easy to create your own adventures.If you find the rules too hard or too easy, modify them or create your own.  For example, we play with two house rules.  First, if two or more heroes flank a monster/villain, the flanking heroes get a +2 to their attack role.  Same rule applies if two or more monster/villains flank a hero.  Second, if you have not moved your maximum squares when uncovering a new tile, you can continue moving into that new tile until you use up your speed and possibly get the drop on a monster if you have not already used your attack.This is a great dungeon crawl game without the time, preparation, and number of players required for a full D&D; RPG adventure.  No dungeon master is required.At $65 MSRP, the game is a little expensive, although, if you enjoy Dungeons and Dragons type games as well as miniatures, the game is well worth the price.  With the size and number of pieces required to play Castle Ravenloft, a large table is required.",5.0,Gothic Horror Dungeon Crawl,1293494400,"12 28, 2010",Toys_and_Games,1.0,,

Nelson ""Amazon Lover""","[8, 8]","I just bought this ice cream maker (Cuisinart ICE-20) and it was a nice surprise to see the ice cream it produces!  I got the promotional deal that just ended where you get a free $30 1.5 qt. replacment bowl - what a steal!  & Free shipping, how can you go wrong!?This is how the ice cream making process works plain and simple:1.) freeze the freezer bowl for a minimum of 8 hours, the longer you freeze it the better.  I'd say 24 hours would be best.  The more frozen and cold the bowl is the better ice cream you'll get.2.) When the bowl's completely frozen (shake it and it should be silent), start your ice cream mixture preparation.  It usually takes 5 minutes to make the mixture (of course it's going to be liquid - it usually includes sugar, heavy cream, milk, vanilla etc).3.) Take the frozen bowl out of your freezer, put it on the ice cream maker, insert the handle/scraper, turn on the machine, put your mixture in the machine, and put a timer on or make note of the time. 25-30 minutes later your ice cream will be ready.  If you wanted to add nuts, fruit etc, you do that in the last 5 minutes.Pros:Easy to use, easy to clean, no ice/salt required (too messy!), quickly makes ice cream after bowl is frozen, great tasting ice cream, you know you're not eating nasty preservaties etc, easy to make at home when you need it (always keep these staple ingredients on hand though!)Cons:  You really can't be in a rush when you make ice cream, something we early figured out.  The bowl really has to be completely frozen, as eager as you may be, it just won't work if you do it to early AND it'll waste your ingredients.  Also, the ice cream comes out not as hard as your typical ice cream from the store (just freeze the ice cream - more waiting, yes!) for 2 to 3 hours and it'll be just like your typical ice cream (this isn't a con of the machine, it's more a con of store bought ice cream and how they add too many preservatives).  You really need 2 freezer bowls if you're making ice cream often.  Keep one frozen while the other one's in use or being washed.Another con - recently tried the chocolate fudgesicle ice cream recipe they give you - total flop.  Stick to the recipes under ""basic ice cream"" for best results.  Slushies turned out well, but next time I'll add sugar.  I guess those 7-11 slushies have a ton of sugar in them!Also, be prepared to buy an ice cream recipe book, as the manual only includes a dozen or so recipes. If you have egg allergies, make sure you don't try the decadent ice cream recipes - they normally include eggs!So far our ice cream has turned out great - best of all  ""Strawberry"", and we tried Regular coke slushies (you can't use diet/sugar free soda)...that also turned out well.Overall, GREAT buy at a great price!  If there's a promotion going on that gives you a free freezer bowl, MAKE SURE YOU GET IT, read the entire page!Good luck and happy ice cream making! :-)",5.0,Great Ice Cream Maker - Unbeatable Price!,1070236800,"12 1, 2003",Home_and_Kitchen,1.0,,

It would freeze while reading a book, or browsing the B&N; store or wouldn't load up from the screen saver. The only way to reboot it was to plug it into the wall and it would reboot. My final straw was when I could no longer unplug my Nook due to it freezing. The second I unplugged it, it would freeze on me and I'd have to repeat the process of plugging it in and waiting for it to start up for me. I called the company, they arranged for me to pick up a new Nook at the closest store and I drove down to get my new Nook. Apparently, as you might have guessed, my Nook had a faulty battery. There was no hassle returning the Nook and the guy even let me test drive the new one before walking out of the store to make sure I was happy with it. The first thing I noticed besides the fact that it didn't immediately freeze up on me was the fact that the power button was secure and didn't jiggle at all.So since I've gone through two separate Nooks, the latest showing minimal signs of problem, I'd say this is a decent product. Maybe I just happened to get the lemon of the lot? I still enjoy reading from my nook. It's a light weight device and small enough that it fits in my purse with ease. The e-ink screen makes it easier to read for extended periods of time without having to take a break due to a headache. The long life battery (when not a dud) lasts long enough for my 20 hr flight and a week without needing to be charged or turned off. Since I've gotten the replacement Nook a month ago, I've only needed to plug it in once. I also like that when I take it outside to read, there is no glare on the screen. It really is as if you are reading a book, except less bulky. I like being able to highlight and make notes in the book, it makes going back for references much easier. With a book, I would take a strip of paper and put it between the two pages, to later go back and reread them to figure out why I put the paper there. Even though I had a less than ideal experience with being a Nook owner I do enjoy the device. I always carry my Nook with me everywhere I go.",4.0,The first one was a dud,1341964800,"07 11, 2012",Electronics,1.0,,

Connolly III ""Father/Husband/Gamer""","[4, 4]","I'm a big fan of games with good theme, so I was a reluctant to pick this game up after reading other reviews that were saying the theme was just added on to the mechanics.  But... I'm fan of worker placement games... and I'm a D&D; player from way back.  So, I pulled the trigger...so to speak.I'm glad I did.  This game is fun, has good design elements, and great production value.Production:The box and insert for this game are just awesome. I have lots of games where the insert seems to be an after thought (I'm looking at you FFG).  The box is unique but functional and the insert is one of the best I've seen.  The insert holds all the bits and makes them easy to get to and easy to store and even has beveled sections that allow you to easily remove the components. The manual also has a section dedicated to showing you how to store the pieces.  One of the best box designs ever.Game Play:There is plenty of player interaction unlike many Euro type games.  Simply put, you are placing workers to collect resources that you turn in for points.  However, you can see what every other player is attempting to collect and you have the option to delay and interfere with them if you want.  Every turn has plenty of options and I didn't really get the feeling, like I do with a lot of Euros, that the game was playing me.  The game is simple to teach and moves along pretty quickly.Theme:The theme is just a layer on top of the mechanics, but I did enjoy it.  The resource collection aspect of the game manifests as ""quests"" that you complete/turn in.  The resources are your typical D&D; types: Clerics, Rogues, Wizards, and Fighters.  As I was playing I found myself looking more at the items I needed to collect and not the quest itself.  The game takes place in the very popular Forgotten Realms city of Waterdeep.  I've read a number of the books and have enjoyed roleplaying in this campaign setting so I think that helped fill in some of the gaps that a tightly integrated theme normally fills.Final Thoughts:This game will have a permanent place on my shelf.  It's easy to teach and play.... and I immediately wanted to play again after my first game.  We are four months into 2012 and I think this is one of the best games of the year.",5.0,Not DEEP...

My son has used it, off and on, for about 6 months and it shows no signs of wear. My son started playing with it when he was 12 months old. He loved it right away and would laugh as he crawled through it. It's not too much trouble for me to crawl through now and again, which I do because my son thinks it's hilarious.We used this outside sometimes. The wind will blow it away really easily, so watch out not to leave it in the yard if you don't have a fence.Some of the reviews complain about the ties. This tunnel doesn't come with ties any more, it comes with velcro straps. This makes it really easy to open or close up. I haven't had any trouble with the velcro sticking to the carpet, but it's too bad that they don't make the velcro strap have a section at the end where you can fold it back over on itself (to keep this from happening).I keep the tunnel folded flat behind the door in my son's room.

While building in Germany I used to use these Bahco hatchets for setting timber rafters and splitting kindling for Granny. There is not another hatchet being sold on Amazon that is of this quality in this price range. I brought two back to the USA in my luggage. Damn it! Can't do that any more.The metal has a very distinctive ring to it when chopping. The nice contoured radius edge is easy to maintain and sharpens up well with a few passes of a file. On the hatchets that I own the handles appear to be made of a tight grain beech. The hatchet overall tends to be a tad head heavy which I prefer for splitting wood. Let the tool do the work. I would say that these Bahco hatchets are lifetime tools. As in - they will last you your lifetime.Not really suited to be used as a belt hatchet and does not come with a sheath.Act now and buy two Bahco hatchets before those German wholesalers figure out that they can get more for this product.I've used mine for over 20 years and have only replaced the handle once.Don't waste your money on Fiskars and the China made hatchets.,5.0,Smokin' Deal!,1400112000,"05 15, 2014",Sports_and_Outdoors,1.0,,

Has better graphics than Cobra 7"".  It does have lane assist which is important when in large metro areas and need to be in correct lane for exits, etc Atlanta, GA.  I have read some of the negative comments written earlier and I do not have those problems.  Sure, sometimes it does not give the fastest or the simplest route but it has never sent me down a non truck route like all the prior gps i have had in the past.  I am a car carrier so I set truck size at 13' 8"" and it has kept me from going down roads with 13'6"" bridges.  The only negative comment I have is that it constantly changes map views from city to county to state way to often.  Other than this, I love the fact that:  1) it shows mileage to destination, arrival time (which you can change to time left),  2) shows the city, county and state you are current located (how often we truck drivers pull over at a rest area or truck stop and wonder what city we are located).  3) large 7"" color screen for easy viewing and screen changes automatically for night time driving  4) list truck poi and non truck poi (wish Rand McNally had a feature that would let us send them an update for poi, maybe when we get at a Loves that use to be a Pilot, just tap on the screen and edit info, then when I connect gps to computer for weekly update the map will get updated.  5) able to update construction info by linking gps to computer and get updates given to Rand McNally by the states.  Unfortunately like usual  the states are mostly behind on updates given to Rand McNally.  This is where we the consumer should have the ability to tap screen and make corrections and send it to Rand McNally.  Many times I have gone into areas that it said ""Construction Ahead"" and no construction is being done because it has been completed.  6)  speed limits of highways and Interstates and shows your current speed just below it (also shows truck speed limits in red) Still the states have to report these limits to Rand McNally and as usual they are slow on reporting.  But still most of the time 95% it is correct.  7)  great truckers tools like driving hours left.  It automatically changes to driving when truck has moved for more than 1 mile and changes to off duty if it is idle for 15 minutes.  It lets you know when you have 1 hour left to drive and that driving time has expired. You reset every day manually.  Also have total hours worked for day and hours left to work for the week. You will have to manually override this sometimes because it doesn't distinguish off duty and on duty hours well, you have to manually tell it you are on duty.  I just manually configure at the end of the day.  The important one is driving hours and end of the week hours.  8)  service reminders for your perimeters you set, such as 8000 and 16000 services.  You reset manually when completed.  9)  able to set many multiple stops set and ability to add more stops in route  10) loud enough to hear spoken text to speech street names over engine noise (and believe me my truck is loud)  11) ability to save your own poi (I do it all the time)  12) it tells you when you are 3 miles from approaching a weight station (you can configure it up to 5 miles)  13) it tells you when you are 1 mile from state border and tells you when you cross border and what state you are in.  14) it tells you all mileage you driven that day and mileage by state and mileage by day.  saves info for 1 year.

I think it is great, but a few things made me change my mind about the nook and I just bought a Kindle HD. First, the page numbers shown in the book are not accurate compared to a paper copy of a book. I do a lot of research for school and it makes a difference to my research and even pleasure reading if I know what an exact page number is so I can go back to a paper copy if I need to and know my place instead of using a search tool to find it within a 30 page estimate of where it is. Most pages in the Nook seem to be about thirty pages off from the real paper book.Second, it had somewhat poor customer support--for example finding the free books that are supposedly offered and easy to locate! I had to call Barnes and Noble after searching webpages on Barnes and Noble for ""free books for Nook"" to find a list of recent free books and the answer I recieved was you have to type in a product title ON THE BARNES AND NOBLE WEBPAGE and then the awkward number, 0.0, to find a free book! So, Barnes and Noble makes customers pretty much look up a book in order to find out it is free, but what is the use of that? On a Kindle you can browse easily what is free! I actually typed in 0.0 without a title on the Barnes and Noble webpage and it brought up about 40,000 titles that were almost all trashy fiction books or kids titles.... So at least with a Kindle you truly have a source of titles that are interesting and New York Times Reviewed in some cases that are not hidden in a mirage of kids books and boring fiction novels. On the nook, I only got about two books for free because I could only think of two titles that did not have a copyright that I wanted to read, and they need to make the process of skimming the ""free"" books a little easier than typing a 0.0 in a search bar because if you get more specific than that you also pull up titles that do cost money.There are a few customer service problems I have come across trying to figure out parts of my Nook programs. For example, when I download a book JUST ON MY PC it won't even add it to my library unless I uninstall the entire program and re-install it! I tried figuring it out with two different customer service representatives and had to problem solve myself after they dropped the phone calls! And that was unfortunately on a night I REALLY needed access to a downloaded book just on my PC for school.So, a Kindle will actually drop a book in the Kindle library on the PC without having to re-install the entire Nook PC program, which is a precious waste of time that should not be a problem on a pretty nice Sony laptop that was fresh out of the box in the summer of 2010! Furthermore, I am amazed that every time I install a new version of the nook PC application, it has the same problem no matter how updated the software became. Also, unfortunately, my Nook PC and my Nook itself are pretty disconnected with each other, so if I add a book on my nook it never shows up on my Nook PC unless I uninstall everything and waste 30 minutes of my time including computer restarts!Finally, I think Kindle's connection with amazon and all of its benefits means something about its product appeal. Amazon negotiated deals with Netflix and many companies to help its customers and allows them to use their products anywhere that includes a television, mac, e-reader, and PC anywhere on Earth--but Nook won't even allow customers to BUY a book in a ANY PHYSICAL LOCATION other than the United States . . . and that is just a bummer. I have only been outside the U.S. four times, but I also want to travel and use my  e-reader abroad and cannot buy titles abroad with a Nook. The Kindle company managed to negotiate the entire Harry Potter books and make them available from JK Rowling who did not want to even allow the books to be sold on a Kindle or a Nook  . . . yet nook is not willing to pull enough strings and work enough boardroom tables to allow customers to buy a book abroad! I just think Amazon looks out for its customers more and am putting my future electronic books on a kindle, unfortunately, after being a faithful Nook reader for more than 18 months and despite losing about ten books I bought electronically through the Nook programs.I think the Nook can be great, but its perceived benefits don't appeal to me anyway . . . and customer service is terrible. In addition to everything I just mentioned, they even did not send me a ""welcome pack"" of coupons for my Nook and when I called after six weeks to find out what happened they were a tiny bit ungracious about sending it out when it was supposed to come with it anyway . . . and when I got it the coupons were pretty worthless and nowhere near the ""100"" dollar value they supposedly advertised unless you are interested in a gender-specific and even kid-targeted titles. So I think the Nook has a few duplicitous ""offers"" that are not really real and do not make it worth buying a Nook. I think the most duplicitous advertising campaign associated with the Nook is its perceived video usability! The advertisements for the Nook Color clearly show short videos on it, but it really only handles extremely low-quality viewing and short videos... so that is another reason I think Barnes and Noble needs to be a little more transparent to its customers given that all of the Nook Color advertisements clearly showed moving animations and a couple videos... but you would have to ask a store representative after you bought the Nook about why 95% of short videos on the internet cannot be played on a Nook Color, unfortunately.",3.0,"Outdated, Literally Failed to Deliver, and has More than a Few Glitches with Usability and Customer Service Offers",1358121600,"01 14, 2013",Electronics,0.0,,

We let the bowl sit in the freezer for a few days (it's a new freezer which is set at 0 degrees). All of the other ingredients were very well-chilled (our fridge is set to 35 degrees). I mixed up the stuff & poured it into the ice cream maker. I turned it on & set our timer to 25 minutes. After 25 minutes of that horrid noisy machine, I checked it and the stuff was still a soupy mess! I let it go another 10 minutes. By that time, the base of the machine was extremely hot and the stuff was still soupy. We poured the wannabe ice cream into a bowl, covered it & let it set in the freezer, overnight.

All the books I buy are from Amazon, and so with the nook it won't sync those which is unfortunate.  But where it shines is when I refuse to buy a book because the publishers are being greedy (eg, Dance with Dragons by George RR Martin, game of thrones series...  The ebook costs more than a physical copy.  It even costs more than a physical copy translated into another language!  Give me a break!)  So anyway, when it comes down to piracy to keep the publishers in check - the nook is great.  You plug it into USB, it shows up as a drive on the computer.  You type in the name of a book into google and add ""epub download"" to the end, and somewhere on the first page of results is a working download (at least with every book I've had to try so far.)  Download that straight to the nook's drive letter and you're done.The main reason I wanted it originally, before I found out how incredibly easy the above was, was because of the shape and feel.  I love the shape and feel over the kindle.  But other than that and the simplicity I'd probably go with a kindle for legit purchases (also I'm pretty sure the nook has been officially abandoned by B&N;, which will of course make any syncing that may have existed even more problematic in the future.)",4.0,"Great size and feel, great for non-purchased books",1363996800,"03 23, 2013",Electronics,1.0,,

As long as your expectations are adjusted to these, you will not be disappointed.We received the monitor three days after I placed the order.  Shipping beat up the box quite a bit, but it was very well taped (it took quite a bit of work with a box cutter to reveal the seams) and the contents were undamaged.We're running it in a home-office environment, so it gets better than eight hours per day use, as well as more limited use on the weekends.Others have mentioned that the monitor and external power supply run hot -- this is not our experience.  The PS brick is sitting at the rear of my desk and is at 121F (measured via an IR gun), which is pretty warm but not hot.  The monitor itself is no hotter than you'd expect considering the large backlight area involved.  Certainly a lot cooler than our 60&#34; Samsung TV!We're using it with a 2007-vintage MacBook Pro, via a newly-purchased Apple Mini DisplayPort to Dual Link DVI Adapter, which retails for $100 -- I purchased a new one on eBay for $58 shipped and it's been working flawlessly for the past three weeks.  The MacBook is pushing 2560 x 1600 resolution to the monitor just fine.When I attempted to use this monitor on another computer (WinXP) with my aged NVidia GTX260, I do not see a boot display.  I have not pursued this issue, but if I can get that combo working, I'll be purchasing a second YAMAKASI 301 Sparta for use on that computer as well.At the vantage point of three weeks, my only concern is longevity; I see a reviewer had his similar model die at 14 months.",5.0,"Beautiful display, no hand-holding",1397174400,"04 11, 2014",Electronics,1.0,,

I didn't buy from Amazon but from a toy store on impulse. It basically consists of good quality magnetic dinosaur parts, poor quality scenes and a below average quality tin box. Basically the child lays a scene sheet (thin paper with double-sided printing coated with a glossy wax layer on both sides) on the inside of the tin and assembles the dinosaur pieces on it. Each of the 2 sheets crumple easily and don't look durable for destructive kids. Mine crumpled on first use. I generally love Mudpuppy products but feel this magnetic series could have been better designed with the scenes made magnetic so that each side may hold pieces from a different dinosaur. Right now, because the scenes are not magnetic and that the tin is pretty small, the magnetic dinosaur parts have to be jumbled together as not every piece is able to fit on the tin and makes it so time consuming to sort out which parts belong to which dinosaur.

I've been using them in concert with Tony Horton's Power 90 program and find them to be perfect.It is very easy to connect/disconnect them from the handles which brings me to one of the things I like A LOT about them.  I had started by using the Green (10-12 pound) band.  Then I got to the point where I really needed to move onto the next (Black - 15-20 pound) band for most of the exercises (but not quite all).  Rather than move onto the Black I simply combine the Green I had been using with the Blue (4-6 pound) band.  Then for the ones for which I need the lighter weight I simply and quickly disconnect only one side of the Blue and I'm back to Green.

We are trying to do it more for the kids (10 and 8) but most games are too kid oriented to hold an adults attention or too difficult for the kids to enjoy. This meets the whole family and not just by meeting in the middle. It is challenging enough if you want to apply a lot of strategy but it is simple enough in theory that it need not be difficult at all. What really impressed me is the quality of the game. So many of the games we have purchased have cheaply made boards, all the pieces in cellophane bag that can not be reused and thrown in the empty box, etc. This came with a huge board of great quality, thick game cards printed on a decent stock  rather than thin paper, nice pieces and I love the way the inside plastic organizer for the pieces has well thought out indentions that makes storing the pieces securely possible while also making it possible for you to get ahold of the pieces easily.I have a feeling this is going to be a family favorite for awhile. I enjoyed it so much I spent money on the app so I could also play it on my phone solo but the whole family is always wanting to play that too.",5.0,Wonderful game for the whole family,1389225600,"01 9, 2014",Toys_and_Games,1.0,,

You have to loosen all the nuts required for getting the range of motion, and it seems that the nuts were all tightened at the strongest-man-in-the-world competition. It was VERY difficult to get them to loosen initially.The other installation issue is that the extensions that are included to mount different size TVs did not align properly and the screws provided were the wrong height. The mount comes with a bunch of different screws with varying lengths and thickness, but none of them worked without modification. As a result of those two problems, I had to come up with a jury-rig solution to getting the four expansion pieces attached to our 400x400 TV (Sony Bravia). It's not a bad solution - putting the screw through one of the slats rather than an actual screw hole along with adding a couple washers to create tension with the too-long screws - but I'd rather it be truly universal as the description claims.But even with the installation difficulties, I'd still buy the product again because it's great quality for a low price.",4.0,Works great...once you go through the pain of getting it installed,1361750400,"02 25, 2013",Electronics,1.0,,

My son loved the game so I bought this board for him. The construction seems quality, the pieces are sturdy.  I'd definitely recommend it to someone looking for a board.  The two shortcomings, in my opinion, are minor but enough to warrant comment.First, the many pieces (most of which I don't yet know how to use) come in a plastic bag that once you open it, it doesn't close again.  The board does not include a box for either the board or the pieces.  I realize the board itself is big and a box might not be necessary, but until I put all the pieces in a big zip-lock bag, I was constantly losing rings and pegs.  And even still, the two sticks don't fit into my bag.Second, the included direction book has an extraordinary number of games and variations, which is awesome, but some of them are so vague and short or incomplete, they aren't as helpful or clear as you would like when you are learning new games. I had some questions about the rules when playing Crokinole and the short little directions included did not answer my questions.Overall, I'm happy with the product.",4.0,"Well built, quality materials, but a few shortcomings",1373241600,"07 8, 2013",Sports_and_Outdoors,1.0,,

I thought this would be a great device, especially since it received such positive responses from reviewers on several sites.I've had the Nook (3 of them, actually) and am returning it before my 14 day window is up.First, the buttons are annoying to use. I like having the option to tap the screen, but I'd rather keep it as clean and clear as possible. Simply hard to press the buttons down. They don't seem to be getting any easier after finishing a book.Second, and most importantly, is the contrast and quality of the screen. Different letters are darker than others on every page, within words, and they change every time I go to the next page and back. I thought it might have just been something weird with the files, or formatting, so I played around and did the troubleshooting. Nope. It's just horrible to look at.After having 3 with the same problem, I'm going to just send it back. No need to go through that cycle and then be stuck dealing with the awful customer service.

I use it to make non-dairy ice cream with Vances Dari-Free which is a powdered milk substitute made from potatoes. It works absolutely brilliantly and for the first time in a decade I actually had 'ice cream'. With Vances you must pre-make the ice cream mix in a pot and heat it. The mix must be allowed to cool in fridge for a few hours. Then simply place it in the Cuisinart and turn on. In a half hour you end up with a soft serve ice cream that tastes just like the real thing. The device is so easy to use and clean we've been using it every day! This is one of the greatest items I have purchased in a long time and I only regret that I waited so long to get one. Here's my recipe I developed:In a pot add:9 tablespoons of powdered Vances Darifree (or any powdered milk)3 tablespoons of tapioca starch flour6 tablespoons of sugar3 cups of waterTurn heat on medium and whisk constantly to combine the dry mix with water and to prevent sticking to the pot. The mix will begin to thicken after a few minutes.Now add:1/3 cup of any butter, margarine of choice+1 or 2 teaspoons of Vanilla or other extractContinue heating and whisking until the mixture is completely combined and thickened. I do this until it begins a low boil - bubbles and steam begin.Cool in fridge and follow ice cream maker instructions.* If you want to use soy milk, rice milk or other milk simply eliminate the powdered Vances and water and replace with any 3 cups liquid substitute.* If you want to make Carob or Chocolate ice cream add 1/4 cup powdered cocoa or roasted carob to the dry mix.",5.0,Makes perfect ice cream - even non-dairy!,1182470400,"06 22, 2007",Home_and_Kitchen,1.0,,

She'd much prefer to write a short story, complete with her own illustrations.  After having a few completed masterpieces sitting about the house, my daughter lamented that she wished she could have it published 'like a real book'.  So my search began, and ended, with this product.  She received it as a Christmas gift, and almost immediately began working on her story (titled 'I'm a Superhero!').  Following the simple, clear instructions in the package, we were able to send off our manuscript for publication.  It did take a little bit to receive the completed product back; in fact, I even emailed the manufacturer to inquire about it as I was worried it may have gotten lost.  Never fear, though, it arrived shortly afterward, and my daughter was thrilled with the hardcover book which she had written, illustrated and designed (by choosing the book color, fonts, etc.)  I love the 'About the Author' page too, and it's so worth it get it printed with your child's picture.  Imagine her face when she sees it!  We even purchased a second one to give to her on her birthday, and this time we tried the internet option.  The advantage here is that you can make the text of each page as long as you want, instead of the rather restrictive 20-word limit per page on the mail-in version.  The drawback, though, is that the drawings will not have that kid-drew-it innocense since the illustrations are also made on the computer.  Having done both versions, I think we'd stick with the internet version from now on, so she can write more and more complex stories as she gets older.  For a child who loves to write and draw, what better gift could they receive than the ability to publish their very own hardcover book?

The kit comes with everything that you need to create the book: worksheets for the brainstorming and outlining process, a place to record the author's information and dedicate it to someone special, pages to create your story, and a special page to design a cover with your own artwork.  Your child writes the story (HINT: you can use more words per page by creating a word template with the correct margins and typing the text yourself), draw the pictures, and send the completed packet in to the company.  You can pay extra for special features and additional copies, but if you just want a standard, hard cover copy of your book, there is no additional cost after purchasing the kit.  The book arrives in your mailbox looking like something you'd see in the library, except that it's your child's special work!We use an Illustory every year as a homeschool project during the spring semester.  My son's stories often revolve around something fun that happened during the year or something that we studied.  Each year I can see how his sentences grow more complex and his vocabulary improves compared to his previous books.  I can also see the development in his fine motor skill through the details in the illustrations on each page.  We love looking back at the books that he's made, and we always order an extra copy to give to the person that he chooses to dedicate his book too.We highly recommend Illustory for any child who struggles with writing and needs a fun and creative way to make writing a positive experience.",5.0,Fun Way to Track Writing Development,1382832000,"10 27, 2013",Toys_and_Games,1.0,,

Rosewarne,"[0, 0]","This watch was great while it lasted, but be warned, the bezel will fall off and SURPRISE it turns out that this is not covered under the warranty. Designed in Finland, but made in China and it shows and it is clear to me exactly why it is not covered under the warranty.I should have known better from the start since 30M water resistance on something that is being marketed as 'military' is a joke. Military in this instance just refers to the black coloring/cosmetics and only serves to support the fashion aspect of it as some kind of mil-spec piece of equipment, which I can assure you it is not. I have dive watches, so this wouldn't have been used in the water that way and so I purchased it anyway......much to my dismay.The watch was decent while it lasted, it just didn't last that long. So much for Suunto 'sports' watches. Their image as a maker of high quality outdoor gear type stuff is all just a marketing ploy and has no real basis in their products or their support for their products. They are just big fashion accessories for people that want to look outdoorsy.I snowboard, mountain bike, dive, windsurf, trek, surf, climb, camp and pretty much do everything you can do outdoors and so when it came time to get a new watch, a Suunto was an obvious option. At $350 the X-Lander Military seemed it would be a ruggedly built watch and be able to stand up to that kind of use pretty well. Wrong.The first thing that went after about 4 mos. was the loop part of the watch band that holds down the extra strap portion when it is on your wrist, so that it was always sticking up. Rather than buying a new band, I just started using my girlfriend's black hairband/rubber bands for that and it worked better than the original part. The band that comes with this watch is just cheap plastic, plan on getting a different one if you buy the watch. I wish I had just returned the watch at that point.I typically only used the watch when doing stuff outdoors b/c it is too bulky for regular daily wear, so I imagine it was used maybe 50-60 days in a little under 2 years. One day, while not doing anything too taxing (driving actually), the face bezel just falls off. I snap it back on and was thankful that it didn't come off and get lost. The next time it came off, it did get lost.No problem, I assume that Suunto would have an adequate warranty and being used to dealing with companies like North Face, Patagonia and REI all the time, I assumed they would stand by their product. Wrong again. Suunto is NOT like that.I called Suunto and was informed that the warranty DOES NOT COVER the face bezel falling off. Huh? The customer service rep informs me that these are connected when they leave the factory and therefore not covered b/c they are not supposed to come off (I responded with 'that much we can agree on, they should not come off). He then goes on to tell me that it will be at least $90 to send it to them to fix it, because they have to also replace the inner metal casing part of the face. Again, huh? $90 for what would be about $7 (if that, they make the damn things after all) in parts and perhaps 30 minutes of labor? Are you kidding me?I bought a Tag Heuer Kirium watch back in 1999 and I took that everywhere and did EVERYTHING with it for years, including diving and that included a 2 year stint backpacking throughout South America and all manner of outdoor adventures and that thing has never skipped a beat. Ever. And it isn't even a sports watch AND I still wear it constantly for regular use.I told Suunto customer service person there is no way I'm going to waste $90 fixing what turns out to be just a BIG WATCH fashion accessory when they can't even guarantee me the bezel won't just fall off again and will just leave it in the gear bag as a semi-functioning backup.They won't post my review on their website for obvious reasons, so that should tell you a lot about how much they care about their customers right there.",1.0,"Initially a great watch, until it fell apart that is",1392768000,"02 19, 2014",Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,0.0,,

Rosetta Stone claims to design their software based on the idea that you can learn a second language the way you learned your first one, through so-called immersion. First of all, using Rosetta Stone hardly qualifies as immersion. Secondly, anyone who has studied second language acquisition knows that adults do not and should not learn language as if they were children. It may sound easy because most of us don't remember much about learning our first language, but if you think about it from a common-sense perspective you will realize that even a ten-year old native speaking child still makes many errors. Do you want to spend ten years trying to learn a second language? Second language acquisition programs should take into account the fact that adults have many more language and cognitive skills that they can employ in their language study than children do. A well-developed program would account for this and use this to the learner's advantage. Rosetta Stone does not do this.From a motivational standpoint it is also a very discouraging program. As others have said, it doesn't teach you how to communicate. Pimsleur's audio programs, while still limited in some ways, have the advantage of teaching you language that allows for immediate conversation (or immediate conversation with people you don't know well.) I found it very encouraging that I was able to use the Turkish I learned in my first lesson to strike up a conversation with a Turkish man I met at an international dinner at my university. All I did was asking him if he was a Turk and respond that no, I am American when he asked me if I was Turkish. (You can imagine how please I was to be asked.) But with Rosetta Stone you won't be able to do this. You'll be able to say hello and then point to the people at another table and make the astute observation that they are eating a meal.It is unfortunate that the program is not more useful because resources for Turkish study are quite limited. But until Rosetta Stone learns to incorporate some conversational skills and sound SLA theory into their programs I would suggest avoiding them unless you have money to burn.",1.0,Poor Pedagogy,1296259200,"01 29, 2011",Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,0.0,,

Skiing, hiking, trekking, snorkeling, running. It's great. I bought an X-Lander just for the metal case, but if it wasn't around, I'd get another Vector. After all that time, the only things wrong were that the liquid in the face bubble evaporated (it was there until two years ago)and the bezel compass markings have worn a bit.The X-Lander is just very cool looking with the metal case, a better rubber wristband, wider and a better keeper.

The repellant softened the plastic of the battery to the point where the impressed lettering wore away and I could scratch the surface with my fingernail. The rest of the case and the strap were fine. I called Suunto about it and they told me that the manual says not to expose the watch to chemicals. I replied that soldiers and Marines use insect repellant much of the time, and that they should make the cover from Aluminum as they do the case. Apparently, this fell on deaf ears. They are sending me a replacement cover. I noticed in their accessories that they sell replacement covers, which are also available on Amazon here, so this seems to be their solution. But the case and plastic strap were not at all affected, just the battery cover.

One notable that is lacking is Buddy's ""Whenever I'm Lonely"" which is one of my favorites.  For some reason Jimmy Bowen recorded a very mediocre version of the song which is on his section of the CD.  I'm not sure there was any reason for Buddy to remake ""Mary Lou"" & ""Maybelline"" since they were far better done by the original artists, Ronnie Hawkins & Chuck Berry.  But overall, considering all the Knox classics included, it's a nice collection.Jimmy Bowen's offerings were in my opinion fair to poor.  I really couldn't get into any of his songs.

Why he decided to make his own version of Knox's ""Whenever I'm Lonely"" is a mystery.  While I'm sure that Jimmy can pick a guitar with the best of them he just doesn't have the voice to carry any of these tunes.  Fortunately he later found his nitch as a successful record producer.",3.0,Knox rocks! / Bowen doesn't!,1123459200,"08 8, 2005",Sports_and_Outdoors,0.0,,

We now have all of the faction packs including this release, which is the newest.  It is definitely noteworthy that ALL of the miniatures included in this pack are completely NEW, not re-releases from the old D&D; 3.5-era miniatures booster packs.  The previous Dungeon Command faction packs (Cormyr, Lolth, Goblins and Undead) all featured old miniatures, although many of those creatures have new color schemes.  To some tabletop RPG enthusiasts, the miniatures alone will be well worth buying this pack.  They are EXTREMELY well designed models with VERY nice paint.  We spent about 10 minutes marveling at the figures before we even thought about checking out their matching game cards.Dungeon Command Veterans: The creatures/order cards from this pack add lots of fun new elements to gameplay and strategy and match well with any of the other faction packs.  In our first game, we pitted the Orcs of this set versus the Undead.  There seemed to be a very nice balance between the power of both factions, playing them right out of the box without customizing warbands.  Now that we have all of the faction packs, I think we'll probably start doing some customization.If you are new to the Dungeon Command game, this is a very fun strategy board game / Trading card game hybrid where you essentially battle your army versus your opponents creatures until one warband proves victorious.  You draw cards in to your hand during your turn to bolster your creatures basic attacks/abilities.  The game takes about 2-3 minutes to set up, once you know how to play and a match can run anywhere from 30 minutes to 3 hours depending on how serious you get (kind of like chess.)  One of the best things about Dungeon Command is that you can easily put it away/set it back up if you need to take a break in the middle of a game.  My boyfriend and I usually play an entire match in two sittings during the weekdays.  If you are in to the D&D; world and/or role-playing, you can definitely add as much RP and dialogue as you'd like.  If RPing isn't your thing, don't worry-- there's no dice rolling or paper and pencil requirement for Dungeon  Command, just lay out the board, draw your hand and you're ready to play!",5.0,Another great Dungeon Command set!,1363737600,"03 20, 2013",Toys_and_Games,1.0,,

Throw it in!""  And as for the lyrics, there are some patches that are just brilliant (""Where are all the stupid people from? And how'd they get to be so dumb?""), and a lot that sound too much like some high school student railing against the evils of the government like he just found his first philosophy textbook.But random yelling at the establishment is kind of to be expected in this style of music (otherwise, the more thuggish fans wouldn't approve, and we can't have that can we?).

We purchased it for a Santa present and instead of constructing it for him, we thought it would be great for Daddy and my son to do it together Christmas day. It was a good activity, but it took about three hours for my husband and my son to put together and a few of the parts broke during assembly. Mind you, these two build things together all the time. My five year old can construct snap circuit into models not even listed in manuals on his own. Now that the toy is constructed, it is a lot of fun and my two year old likes it too, but pieces are always falling apart and breaking. Thankfully there are a few extra pieces in the kit. Also, there are a few gears that provide a function in the marble run, but those gears in the front are just for decoration--so a little deceiving. All in all, it's a decent toy, but expect some time to assemble and some frustration, even with parental help.

Eventually we purchased a Kindle too so we could each have an e-reader.However, the Nook Simple Touch slowly began to start freezing, requiring a restart every single time. Because we like the device, I have tried researching everything online to see how to keep it from freezing (carefully dusting it off, charging it, reseting it, etc.) Sitting down to read is hard enough to do at times (am I right?), so I don't need my e-reader to freeze on me when I finally make the time to sit down and read. Based on my research, many others have the same problem with this model. In fact, many people had the same problem with the previous model. They have exchanged theirs at Barnes & Noble, only to report a couple weeks later that their replacement does the same thing!!!  Hmm, I wonder if the new generation of the Nook Touch is going to have freezing problems too???I have been in conversation with Barnes & Noble management (""object key"": 28817953) and they have refused to offer a valid solution to my problem.In short, don't purchase a Nook, they freeze all the time.

It's perfectly usable, but I was always taking it in and out of the pouch.  I wanted something that would protect the Kindle while I was reading.I purchased the Moleskine cover with notepad because I liked the idea of having a place to jot notes.  It arrives beautifully packaged with two notepads.  You have to unwrap the notepads and insert one into the inside front cover.  There are 98 un-lined pages per notepad.  Only a subset of the pages can be easily detached.  The notepads have a black cover and first page is stiff with space to write contact information in case the Kindle is lost.There is even printed text that reads ""As a reward: $___"".  I thought this was interesting; what if I choose not to put in a dollar value?  Would I offend a potential Good Samaritan if I didn't put in a number, or worse, if they felt the number was too low?  In the end, I wrote, ""reward if returned"".The construction of the Moleskine cover is very good, with rigid front and back panels and ample folding space.  You can clip a pen to the spine and not feel like you're squeezing it in.  A pen is not included.When closed, the cover has a quarter-inch elastic band near the right edge that's used to keep the front cover closed.  To my eye it seems a little flimsy, but in practice, it's worked well and has been easy to use.The Kindle itself is held in place by half-inch wide black elastic bands at each corner.  The bands are tight and double-stitched.  I fumbled a little while putting my Kindle under the bands, but once there, it's held securely with no play.It's these bands that cause my only complaint with the Moleskine cover; the on/off sliding switch at the top of the Kindle is partially covered by the top-left elastic band.  I fiddled with the position of the Kindle to put the band to the left of the switch, but it makes finding the left-edge of the switch somewhat harder.It's not a huge problem, but has put a little wrinkle into turning the Kindle on and off.  A similar issue exists with the volume up button on the right.  It isn't as much of a problem as you just have to press down and not slide a switch.  All the other buttons and controls are accessible.Overall, I'm very pleased with my purchase and would recommend it to others.Pros: Attractive styling, excellent construction, good feel without adding significant weight.Cons: Placement of elastic bands at the top left corner can affect how easily the Kindle is turned on/off.  Also, I wish this product was available in other colors, such as brown.Special Note about Left vs. Right handed:  When I wrote this review, there was discussion regarding how the notepad is placed to the left of the Kindle on the inside of the front cover.  Right-handed people wonder how useful that would be.As a left-handed person, I cannot give an opinion on that.  However, I can say that it's not possible to flip the cover around to put the Kindle on the left and the notepad on the right.  While the Kindle could be rotated and mounted that way, the notepad itself is secured by sliding its back cover into a slit near the top of the inside front cover.  The notepad cannot be inserted ""upside down"".The economies of scale make it difficult to market a left-handed version of a product.  The market is 90% right-handed (generally).  Manufacturers have to decide whether or not the cost of producing a variant of the product will be offset by additional sales.  Many times, a left-handed person adapts to the right-handed product.While I suspect right-handed people are not keen to the idea of adapting to something that seems inherently left-handed, that doesn't mean they couldn't adapt and find similar value in it.Looking at how the Moleskine cover is constructed, I think they could change the product so that the notepad could be inserted from either end, thus making it ""flip-able"".  The slit at the top of the inside front-cover is the only limitation currently.",4.0,"Looks great, works well",1276992000,"06 20, 2010",Electronics,1.0,,

It's height requires us to place it in only one spot on our counter where it doesn't bump under the top cabinets, and even there it slightly pushes under on the top lid when setting it back - I think that must be due to a flaw in the evenness of our counter. Our top cabinets are about 14 3/4"" high.But the main pain is the cleanup between pots. You have to break down the inside into the three main pieces - the grinder top, the water system, and the basket/grinder cup combo. Each piece becomes crusted with wet grounds and it's a mess to rinse off. And of course you have to make sure the parts are completely dry again before making another pot. I'm also not sure that the grounds that wash out are good for our septic system. So, if you are having company and making 2-3 pots, it's a lot more work than just dumping the filter and refilling as in conventional machines.I also agree with the person who mentioned the grounds (and we have beans) in the water tank. Your hand won't fit in and there's an additional 4th plastic piece that goes in there which I haven't figured out what it's for.I also read in another review that you can program the shutoff. But ours didn't come with any built-in shutoff, so there's a definite risk that you could leave with the unit still on. This also results in skanky coffee - if my wife gets up early on the weekend and I get up later, I'm often getting an aged cup of caffienated acid from the bottom of the pot. If it were a normal two-hour auto-shutoff, at least I'd be forced to make a new pot first. I'll have to see about programming a shutoff, but then of course if the power goes out or you remove it, you'd need to reset it.OK. That's 4 things. On it's plus side, it does make a good cup of coffee, but frankly I'm not enough of an aficionado to distinguish between freshly ground beans vs. the beans I grind in the store and bring home and use up in a week +/-. I just want a good cup of coffee or three when I get up and easy cleanup.This machine would be good if you have high top cabinets or a space to put it, make one pot of coffee per day, like to buy exotic beans, and don't mind washing several tbsps. of grounds down your drain every day.If you want to make multiple pots, and don't want to spend 5+ minutes cleaning and drying equipment between them, and want an auto shutoff, you'd be better served getting a simpler machine (and maybe a separate grinder).Oh yeah - the carafe does always drip as another review mentioned.",2.0,for the one-pot aficionado,1080604800,"03 30, 2004",Home_and_Kitchen,0.0,,

I prefer my Audio Technica QuietPoint ATH-ANC7Audio-Technica ATH-ANC7 QuietPoint Active Noise-Cancelling Headphonesover these but I got them for their small size.The ear buds are extremely prone to popping out of your ear canal if the cord is at all moved; which was not my case with the stock iPod ear buds. The input connector of the headphones seems to be the weakest hardware aspect as I found them to be scratchy if the body behind the jack is bent in anyway.Sound levels of the headphones feel muted and dull. I tried changing EQ on my iPod to various levels and I never felt the quality matched the AudioTechnica's.

I discovered the film when I was nine, and I was in love with it from that moment on. I read the book at the same age and so went through a stage of daydreaming about free bootin' and playing hooky. The songs are surprisingly good in this film. All of them are catchy, memorable and have clever lyrics. I don't know why this movie is so obscure today, seeing as how it has a stellar cast including Celeste Holme as Aunt Polly, Johnnie Whitaker as Tom, and a young Jodie Foster as Becky. Whitacker is perfect in the role with his wild red hair. I especially love the famous white washing scene, which, in this movie, has a great song called ""Gratifaction"" to go along with it. The film is full of laughs, too, due to great supporting characters like the lovable drunk, Muff Potter, the local busybody, the Widow Douglas, and the trouble-making Huck Finn. Thisnmovie so encapsulates the carefree mood of childhood that it brings tears of nostalgia to my eyes just to watch it.

That is when it decided it would return.  More often than not it would get stuck and sit until someone tapped it with the putter.  The background of the Putt 'N Hazard is a hologram, but nothing that will hold up if it's hit frequently.  The sand and water hazards would catch the ball readily and would guide the golf ball into the chute.The return was never consistent and that's where I feel it would be frustrating if any of us were going to use it for practice.  As a form of entertainment, it was fun, but was soon put aside.  I don't think I'd recommend it for practice because of the totally inconsistent ball return.

It comes with a template showing where to drill the holes and states quite clearly that the holes should be drilled using a 1/4&#34; bit.  I carefully placed the template where I wanted the shelf, and drilled four 1/4&#34; holes.  I inserted the plastic anchors mounted the two brackets for the shelf.  It turns out that the template was not 100% accurate in positioning the holes,  The space between the top and bottom holes was just a fraction of an inch too small to line up properly with the holes in the mounting brackets.  I was able to screw the brackets in place, but the screws did not go into the anchors perfectly.  I went to mount the glass shelf in place and found that there was no means of supporting the weight of the five inch deep, 1/4&#34; thick glass shelf other than the two small set screws which held it in the wall brackets.  There is nothing to extend out under the shelf to support its weight. This revealed the final problem, the anchors were too small for the 1/4&#34; holes the instructions specifically instruct you to drill.  The weight of shelf pulled the upper screws and anchors partially out of the holes. The shelf did not fall, but it is at enough of an angle to that anything placed on it slides to the front.  I am going to have to remount the shelf using larger anchors than those provided, and find a piece of angle iron that I can mount under the shelf to support the glass.

I really enjoyed the exercises--lots and lots and lots that start you out slow, with good step-by-step instruction, and then work up to the larger and more complicated projects.  The only thing, if you are new, I would not spend a fortune on materials.  Student quality paints (like Cotman) are fine to start and it won't break your heart when you have to start a project over and toss your first attempt.  (Do avoid the boxes of 20 tubes of paint for $12).  Experiment with brush sizes and types; I was not comfortable with a #12 brush which the author suggests.

It has so many really irritating quirks and problems.  I've never used any other brand, so I can't compare, but I definitely don't recommend getting a Nook Color.The biggest problem is that the battery life is abysmal.  After just a couple months use, I now only get about 2 hours of use on a full charge, even with the screen dimmed quite a bit.  Since I want to use this when I'm traveling and don't usually have access to an outlet, this is a HUGE problem and extremely limits its usefulness.Besides that:* It has a tendency to turn itself on.  This happens whenever I put in or remove the power plug and sometimes just when it gets jostled.  Sometimes I don't notice because the cover is closed. Turning itself on after I remove the power plug definitely doesn't help with the already abysmal battery power.* When I'm using it while it is plugged in and charging, which is most of the time because of the poor battery, it repeatedly displays the battery charging message, ever 10-20 seconds for a second or so.  This is VERY disruptive when trying to read, forcing me to pause and wait until it disappears.*  While reading, the menu at the bottom pops up A LOT too, for no apparent reason, covering the lower text.* Sometimes books get stuck on one page and won't advance or will skip pages.  It takes quite a bit of finagling to get it to show the missing pages.* There are a few spots on the screen that don't respond to touch, especially near the upper and right edges, which is where webpages usually have critical navigation buttons.* The zoom feature is very hard to use, and the zoom level doesn't stay the same  when moving from page to page, especially on websites. I try to zoom the webpages so I can access buttons under the dead touchscreen spots, but the page won't stay zoomed in when trying to move the page to get to the desired spot.* The touchscreen doesn't work well on webpages, often selecting a different item than the one touched.  This often sends me zinging off to undesired links.* The on-screen keypad doesn't always pop up when trying to type something on a webpage, and there's no way to manually make it show.* The Nook's book filing system is rudimentary and hard to sort.  I would especially like to be able to sort by rating, but it doesn't allow that.  I'd also like to be able to tag books, but can't do that either.* The B&N; online store search is terrible.  You can't do a dual search to narrow down long lists, and it will only list the books alphabetically by title.  On the tiny Nook screen, it takes forever to scroll through long results.  You can't exclude tags.  When I search for mysteries, there's all this paranormal stuff mixed in that I'd like to exclude but can't.* I can't look through my own reviews on the Barnes and Noble website using the Nook Color.  It doesn't support that feature.  I can only access them on my regular laptop.  Dunh.  I read a lot of books and can't keep track of all of them.  It would be handy when I'm thinking about buying a book by an author I've read before to be able to see what I thought of the author's other book.* Some Google apps and Flash Player apps don't work on the Nook.  I subscribe to NFL Game Rewind, something I enjoy when I'm on the road, but I can't watch it on my Nook Color.One thing I do like is that there are a lot of really good, free books for the Nook Color available through the B&N; online store.And I like that I can watch Netflix.",2.0,"abysmal battery life, plus lots of really irritating little problems",1397692800,"04 17, 2014",Electronics,0.0,,

Chocolate chip, peanut butter chocolate chip (my favorite), banana, and coconut ice cream, and a batch each of strawberry and raspberry sorbet. Everyone of them came out great and my family loved them.Making ice cream is as easy as whipping the eggs & sugar together, adding COLD milk and COLD cream, plus what ever other flavors (vanilla) you want to add.  Then pour it into the mixer, wait 25-30 minutes, place the ice cream in the freezer, wait 6-8 hours for it to harden, then chow down on what is probably the best ice cream you have ever eaten!Like other reviewers, I bought the Ben & Jerry's book.  The book is well worth the $10 price, as it has a lot of great recipies and the history behind their ice cream empire.TIPS FOR GREAT ICE CREAM AND/OR SORBET:1) Make sure all of your ingredients are COLD (most important).  If you are adding mini chocolate chips, freeze them.  Every wet ingredient should be refrigerated before attempting to make ice cream or sorbet.2) You have to put your newly-made ice cream/sorbet in the freezer for 6-8 hours to let it harden.  While the booklet that comes with the ice cream maker states you can eat the ice cream once it is done mixing, that's not really true.  While technically, you could eat it, the ice cream has the consistency of very very soft (almost melting) ice cream.  After you mix it, place it into another container (with a sealing lid) and freeze.  Once the ice cream has a chance to freeze, it will look just like ice cream you buy in the store.  In reality, places that make ice cream do the same thing: ice cream does not go from mixer to mouth without a stop in the freezer first!3) Almost as important as making sure all of your wet ingredients are cold is to not remove the freezer bowl until you are ready to mix the ice cream.  Typically, there is less than a minute between when I remove the bowl from the freezer and pour the mixture into the bowl.4) When you first get your ice cream maker, freeze the bowl for at least 48 hours.  After that, I always wait at least 24 hours in between batches, to let the bowl freeze again.",5.0,Great tasting and easy to use !!,1143504000,"03 28, 2006",Home_and_Kitchen,1.0,,

One cautionary note: When they say &quot;one generous quart,&quot; they mean GENEROUS. Particularly if you plan on adding mix-ins. I followed the chocolate chip cookie dough directions exactly and used a batch of the sweet cream base and a cup and a half of cookie dough -- and then had to shut off the machine fast before it overflowed completely!I should've known something was up with the Ben and Jerry directions when the base ingredients included three cups of liquid, another cup of sugar and eggs, AND a cup and a half of cookie dough -- I mean, even without any air mixing in, that adds up to almost a quart and a half. With air mixing in... I ended up with closer to two quarts of ice cream from a theoretically &quot;one generous quart&quot; recipe from that book. So I'd recommend people cut the ice cream base recipes in half to start with if they want to use mix-ins!Other than that, it was a great experience, and I'm looking forward to being able to invent my own variations on things.

However, Rosetta Stone made it easy and fun to learn very basic Italian. This allowed me to keep the travel book with frequently used phrases in my pocket when asking questions at shops and for directions, mainly.The main problem was once I asked in Italian the person usually would speak to me in Italian and I had to confess, in Italian, that I only knew a very little Italian. So at least they could understand what I was able to say! Thanks to Rosetta Stone I was comfortable not only listening but also speaking Italian because I had so much practice doing both.I'd give yourself at least 2-3 months before trying this in-country, but the pace in which you learn is really up to you.

This year, however, marks the first time I've used their line of holders.I was seeking a product like this because this year marks 100 years of the Lincoln penny and 200 years since Lincoln was born. The honor these milestones, the Government has released four different pennies. The first penny marks Lincoln's birth and childhood in Kentucky; the design shows a log cabin and his year of birth; this penny was released in February. The second penny symbolizes Lincoln's formative years in Indiana. The design shows him on a log reading a book; this penny was released in May.The third penny represents Lincoln's pre-presidential years in Illinois. The design shows Lincoln standing outside the state capitol building in Springfield; it was released in August. The fourth penny symbolizes Lincoln's term in office. The penny shows the unfinished Capitol dome. This symbolizes the division between North and South and Lincoln's effort to save the Union. This penny was released earlier this month.After having a bad experience with Whitman's folder for the Westward Journey nickels of a few years ago, I opted for this holder. So far it has done a good job holding each penny with holes for each describing each design. A fifth hole at the top is for the obverse (""heads"" side) of the penny. The holder is also very sturdy as well. The design features a montage of photos that shows the statue of Lincoln from the Memorial, an image of a medal with Lincoln, the US flag, and a painting of Lincoln. On the bottom is a quote from Lincoln's second Inaugural Address. Overall I'm impressed with the design.For someone who doesn't want to collect the entire Lincoln series and just wants these four pennies, this is a great little holder.

With all the buzz, I, of course, ran out to BN to see the Nook when it first came out and was incredibly disappointed at that time as it was painfully sluggish and I had almost crossed it off my list for purchase. However, I went back and saw it again at the store after about 6 weeks from my first viewing and what a difference! Barnes and Noble has made great strides. A friend showed me her Kindle and I got to play with it and I looked in stores and saw the Sony reader as well. Did MUCH research online as well on some of the others such as Jetbook Lite.As much as I LOVE Amazon and shop here more often than I probably should LOL. I decided on the Nook seeing the improvements that were already made in that short amount of time. What sealed the deal for me was the SD card option to expand memory AND you can change the battery yourself as opposed to having to send your device back over a simple battery change.I am not regretting my decision to go with the Nook at all. I have to admit that it did freeze up on me twice, BUT it only did that when I interrupted the charging process. So, I don't know exactly what caused that. No problems at all while reading. As far as reading on the Nook, its a great device. Downloading books is fast and simple to do. Page turning is fast now. Its a dream come true for an avid reader like me.The only con that I've noticed so far is battery life. I think its a huge stretch to say the battery lasts 10 days. However, the wi-fi turns itself off after being idle for a minute or so, so you don't have to manually turn it off. When you activate the menu, it will reconnect to the network. So, BN is making an effort to increase battery life without much manual interaction.I highly recommend the Nook. With BN updates coming as quick as they are, I think this device is proving to be THE superior ereader.",5.0,Giving other readers a run for their money,1265673600,"02 9, 2010",Electronics,1.0,,

Might not be so bad if their walled garden economic model was viable but the product was rushed out before the garden was planted.  It is impossible to sort choices by avg customer rating so you have to wade through it all which is thankfully meager.  There is supposedly an advantage in that you can visit any B&N brick and mortar store and the staff will gladly help you, they are cheerful but in the end not very helpful.  After suffering through a common problem of the micro SD card getting stuck after two weeks of minimal use I asked to exchange it and was told to send it in at my expense and that it would take a minimum of 3-4 weeks.  There are no advantages to purchasing from one of their stores, the removeable storage that distinguishes it from others is a problem and with customer service like this they should be out of business soon.

Caruso ""The Happy Aspie""","[6.0, 10.0]","We (my husband, son, and I) are Toy Story and LEGO fans, so this seemed like a perfect choice for a family activity and toy.LEGO thoughtfully puts the pieces in little bags with one for each car, which makes navigating the visual assembly diagrams a little less frustrating.Assembling this was a lengthy affair and there was more than one mention of the time it took to build the transcontinental railroad. It took my husband (he has been an avid LEGO fan for at least 30 years) and I (I'm the person that doesn't read the manual and likes to figure it out on her own, though I do have limited dexterity which makes LEGO a challenge for me) almost 2 hours to assemble all of the cars.Once assembled, the train and the cars are pretty cool.  Though due to the intricacies of the construction, this doesn't seem to me like a set you would really take apart and build something else (which is what I loved do do as a kid)...All of the main characters are represented and I like having our favorites (Buzz, Woody, Hammy, etc) in our general LEGO man population. I do wish they looked more like LEGO interpretations of the characters though (like in the LEGO video games of Star Wars and Indiana Jones), but they are still pretty neat to have.One of the cars has a trapdoor mechanism which is fun (my 7 year old had a ball making the LEGO guys disappear)...This is a train made out of LEGO and I was surprised that once it was assembled, it is pretty sturdy. After playing with it for a little while I feel like I can appreciate the epic instructions, all of the tiny pieces, and the lengthy construction.The one thing this train doesn't have is tracks.  For some reason, the image on the box made me think it was more of a train set than just a train.  Not that you need the tracks, as the wheels do just fine on tile, but I was hoping to add a motor and have it circle a track of some sort like a more traditional train set.All in all, it is a nice set and perfect for a Toy Story and LEGO enthusiast.  The construction is challenging though, and in my humble opinion, the construction is too challenging for the age group that would really play with this, and I feel that maybe this is more of a collector's item.  For our family, it meant that we spent 2 quality hours working together toward a mutual goal, and then all of us were proud of the results.

As a result of luck only, no one was in its path. Customer service had no real response; they suggested that I pay $20 to replace the broken parts.An examination of the broken blade shows that this is likely to be a recurring problem with this model and any other Cuisinarts using a similar blade. It is clear that this structural failure is due to a lack of reinforcement of the blades at the point of riveting. The removal of material for the placement of the rivets, the thinness of the material, and the large amount of leverage placed upon the rivets by the longer blades led to the structural failure of the part. This failure could have happened at any time, and could have caused severe injury to the user. The tempering necessary to create blades that stay sharp is the same tempering that makes it impossible to have such thin, un-reinforced parts. The blades should either be made of thicker material, or have a wider section in the area of rivet contact to avoid failure.",1.0,DANGEROUS,1263254400,"01 12, 2010",Home_and_Kitchen,0.0,,

Learned that in the first 5 minutes. :)Ok, overall the program is good. This was my first experience with Rosetta Stone software and I like it. They really did one heck of a job making learning fun and easy. I highly recommend the software if you want to learn a second language, it looks like it is a good product. I would definitely try other languages after seeing just how easy it is to use this stuff.What didn't I like?For starters the headphones and microphone that came with it are NOT quality, they are not comfortable and my ears got really hot. It was like wearing styrofoam balls over my ear[...]. Sure wish they headphones were at least padded better. The microphone seemed to work well, my only gripe here is the comfort of wearing it. And if you follow this program you will wear it a lot!Second, it took nearly 30 minutes for me to install the software. I understand software piracy but between the lengthy install process, having to scratch off a 28 digit code from a little plastic card and manually enter that and the several updates I had to download it was a bit dull. I sure would have like a faster, easier program to install. So don't think you can just pop this in and you are good to go, you need to first install the application, then install the language pack, then update it (if updates are available) then you need to scratch off the secret code and activate the product, then you have to setup your user profile and THEN you can finally get started.Overall the product is good, I give it 4 stars out of 5 because the software is really the key here. The headset is low quality and that takes away from the experience. I would almost they NOT provide a headset then provide the one they did. And second the install was lengthy. I got the french lesson, I don't want to have to install the application and then a language pack. The software should be smart enough to install both the app and language pack together to make the process even easier.And yes, I am a software developer so when I review software I look at it from a complete implementation standpoint.

They are a great way to learn field marks and identification in a way that you will remember them when out in the field. The Peterson Field Color-In Guides are not meant as a replacement for a regular field guide, but they are an excellent supplement for them. With the winter months coming on, you will really enjoy having these Peterson Field Color-In Guides at home to color and learn when the weather will not allow you to get outside and hike, kayak, or explore nature.I purchased the Peterson Color In Book Wildflowers during a visit to the Bosque del Apache Wildlife Refuge Gift Shop last week. (Actually I had quite a little coloring book shopping spree, so I will be reviewing more of them later this week!) I have been wanting a copy of one of the The Peterson Field Guide Color-In Books for a while, and this gave me a chance to make the purchase in a way that benefits a wildlife refuge that I use and enjoy. (I will be writing a blog entry for my main blog about our visit to the refuge later, and will be sure and link to it here in case you are interested)What I like about this coloring book for adults is that it has detailed drawings to color of the wildflowers, along with a few facts about each of them. There are four pages of colored stickers at the front of the color-in book for reference. You can place the stickers next to the line drawing for reference, as they suggest, or leave them where they are and peek back and forth (that would be me) or even use them to decorate something completely different.The book overall is divided into four sections by environment. Three related wildflowers are featured on a page, with some facts about each of them, for several pages.  There are followed by a two page spread to color showing the flowers in their natural environment. The pages are good quality, but printed front and back. Like many of my coloring books, I will probably scan all of the pages and print out and color the ones I want to work on at any given time. I can't wait until the people who print coloring books figure this out and start giving us a CD-ROM of the pages along with a printed version of the book. The fine line, detailed and intricate drawings beg for colored pencil to work them, although the introduction suggests you might also want to use watercolors. Crayons can be used, but are probably much too blunt for many of the smaller details.In conclusion, I am really happy with this coloring book for adults. It is an excellent way to learn to identify the wildflowers, shells, or animal species, while also being fun. I think it would be a great addition to a home schooling program, or for any older child or adult who is very interested in nature.",5.0,An excellent way to learn to identify wildflowers,1352678400,"11 12, 2012",Home_and_Kitchen,1.0,,

They're 8 and 11 years old and I was excited to see them tinkering with what seemed like a ""brain"" toy.The ball is well constructed and provides a fair deal of entertainment as you mess around with how the pieces fit together. The packaging includes a nice booklet about the ball and certain shapes one can make. Unfortunately I found these 2D pictures to be next to useless. What's more is that every shape they showed was very similar to the fully assembled ball. And this brings me to the chief complaint.There just isn't much you can do with these! I tried and tried again with my younger cousins, I'd sit down and say ""Alright, we're going to make something totally different from the ball"" but quite literally every time I tried, I'd come back to the same shape. This is because the pieces are naturally pretty odd and unfortunately don't fit together in lots of interesting ways. And like the other critical reviewer said: if you attempt to make something that doesn't ""lock together"" but is only held together by the magnetic attraction, it will be so slippery and flimsy that you can't do anything with it. The magnets are generally very weak, designed only to pull each piece together for the ball.At this point, I would immediately recommend my favorite desk toy, a cube of neodymium magnet spheres. However, they're very dangerous for young children prone to swallowing them, and not really worth it for any younger kid that can't keep very good track of all 216 magnets (which is very necessary). So, I'll put the decision on you. If you're an adult, I promise you'll enjoy a magnet cube more. If you're buying for a young kid though, this is a good first foray into the world of magnetic tinkering toys. Just keep the cube in mind when they get a bit older.Popular cubes include: Neocube 216pc Magnet Puzzle (Keep Away from Children - Age 14+) and Buckyballs, also available on Amazon (but seemingly not in the catalog of links).",3.0,"Only worthwhile for very young children; otherwise, go for real magnets",1293494400,"12 28, 2010",Toys_and_Games,0.0,,

No problem with the Blue Logger GPS but my complaints are as follows:1. Delorme did not include the Blue Logger Manager software on the HH. Now they want to sell it separately for additional $39. Very Weird marketing strategy indeed.2. The software for the pocket PC is very difficult to use, not very intuitive. It seems the hand held software was developed as an afterthought from the software for the pc. It is poorly designed, and appeared was not fully tested by normal users prior to releasing to market.3. It is very cumbersome and slow to determine a route. Even with a 620 MHz Axim, it is slow. Worse yet, the route is often wrong. FOr example, this afternoon I use SA2005 to determine a route to a friend's house. Had I followed that route, I would come to a dead end street and have to back track about 10 miles to get to another correct route to my destination. Luckily, I decided to use my paper map. Later, I tried Microsoft Mapping on the internet and it actually gave me the correct routing. Last week for another location, SA2005 found the wrong location for a given address which would take me about 4 miles off. Luckily, I knew where it was and ignored the routing from SA2005 HH.4. Many other mapping softwares for HH will allow one to use it with 1 hand and often with the finger. But not with SA2005 HH. After 2 weeks of using it, I found myself going back to my old paper map. For example, if I had not calculated a route and just simply use the GPS and map to travel, the software only show the street I was on but no name given and no street name shown for upcoming cross streets. It does not help when you are lost.5. SA2005 maps seems to be several years old and not very up to date. I guess that's why Delorme does not want to clearly advertise this issue.I am seriously considering giving up SA2005 and consider this as my $50 learning mistake, and looking at Microsoft Street & Trip 2005 or later in 1Q 2005, IGuidance who is supposed to have the latest map.I am not alone in this as several other users have also complained on delorme user forum. I wish I had read that forum before buying Delorme software. Well, Live and Learn.",2.0,Street Atlas 2005 HH provides wrong route and hard to use,1103328000,"12 18, 2004",Electronics,0.0,,

Smooth alloy, black matt plastic, mineral crystal glass and an excellent band make it an unusual looking watch and it's comfortable to wear. The dial read out is BIG and very clear. Some of the indicators are tiny by comparison but after a while you get used to the layout. Commands via the four buttons are easy once you master the 'tree' of settings. The buttons are not marked on the watch (anywhere) so you need to remember the sequences but again it's not that hard. The temperature read out is not correct when you are wearing the watch (it's about 4c higher) but it quickly moves down when taken off. All the other features appear to work well. I've taken the watch out on my boat and the compass function is great. Took off for a swim (salt water) with no issue. The really cool thing is the back light which has an light green haze to it.

This is the best and easiest ""dessert type"" appliance I have ever owned. For a change, a product actually works as well as the manufacturer says it will. Once the freezer bowl is frozen, we use it, rinse it out and keep it in the freezer where it is always ready to use. All you have to do is pour a few ingredients in through the spout, turn it on and wait, usually about 20 to 25 minutes for 1 and 1/2 quarts of homemade ice cream. The ingredients are things that you may normally have on hand, like half and half, sugar, milk. There are no speacial ice cream mixes to buy. We are having fun just experimenting with different ingredients to come up with our own flavors. It not only makes the best tasting ice creams, but also frozen yogurts, sorbets, sherbets and our all time favorite summer treat, slushies. Just about anything that you would drink can be turned into a slushie in about 15 minutes. Nothing better than a ""beer slushie"" after cutting grass on a hot summer day.

After about 1 year, which incidentally is the Warranty Period, the watch started falling apart.  First, the little tab on the clasp broke off.  Then, one of the dial markers (the 7-o'clock marker) popped out and was floating around banging around inside the watch face.  Then lastly, the watch keeps dying on me.  I changed the battery with new fresh batteries 3 times already, and it dies on me all the time.  I take off my watch at night, wake up the next day before going to work, and see that the watch stopped around 2am the night before.  I have to adjust the time, then go to work.  Then, sometime during the day it'll stop.  I look at my watch and I think it's 3:15pm-- what a long work day...  And realize it's actually 7pm!!

It's sleek and polished, but upon closer inspection, I found the case to be a bit questionable. Let's start with the pros and move onto the negatives:Pros:- Looks great- Doesn't pick up pocket lint- Variety of colors in case you get bored with the frame- No reception issues of note- Beveling/lip near the edges of the screen isn't very intrusive - it seems to provide enough of a lift to protect the screen from resting directly on a dangerous surface, but still rests comfortably on the ear- The case has button overlays the accentuate the caseCons- The case is SLIPPERY. This is the sacrifice for having a case that doesn't attract lint in your pocket, but you WILL lose your ability to grip the phone, especially when compared to the faux leather backing.- The button overlays seem to be made out of cheap material. I'm expecting the chrome paint/surface of the buttons to start peeling or wearing within a few weeks- The worst part - the interchangeable/replaceable &#34;hybrid&#34; frame is really nothing more than very cheap, very pliable, and very thin plastic &#34;frame.&#34; I'm very concerned that a drop at the right angle will cause the frame to break. If the frame does break, the primary layer will be bare, leaving a very uncomfortable and awkward edge/indentation on the sides of the phone.  Additionally, without this frame, it's very difficult to press the buttons, as the button overlays are attached to itFor $25, I was expecting a hybrid layer covering the phone and a metallic or other semi-hard frame covering the sides.  Unfortunately, it is just plastic overlaid with a near paperthin plastic frame.  Please check the pictures section for examples of the flimsiness.Overall, the case is great looking, but I definitely don't expect it to last for the life of the phone (especially if it does take a drop).  Still, $25/per case/per drop is cheaper than the $100 deductible for an insurance payout...

Actually I'm kind of fond of the layout of the case, it gives the whole thing a very book-like feel. The extra thickness of the notepad also helps protect the screen from pressure and sharp edges, particularly when sitting in a briefcase or backpack with other objects.The only real downside I've found with the case is its bulk. It does add some thickness and weight to the reader, and make it bigger to hold, but the elastic straps make it easy enough to take the Kindle out and read it ""naked."" I've also found the spine of the case is a great place to clip your $5 book light, so you don't have to buy a $20+ light that fits your reader.Overall I think it's a good case, it looks nice and gives back some of the ol' analog feel to your digital reader, and it comes at a price competitive with many other cases that don't include the notepad.",5.0,Classy and sturdy,1282521600,"08 23, 2010",Electronics,1.0,,

No, it doesn't make bad coffee. No, you can't just dump coffee beans or ground coffee into the coffeemaker and make good coffee automatically.The Coffee Bar, as Cuisinart likes to call it, does have several internal parts which must all be in place before you can brew coffee.  You can use ground coffee, but you're defeating the purpose of the Coffee Bar by doing so.  The grinder compartment can hold enough beans to make 10 strong 6-oz cups of coffee which is what &quot;10-cup&quot; usually means with appliances.  I like my coffee very strong and I've been able to load more than enough beans into the coffeemaker to get the strength of coffee I want.Between the grinder and the attached drain basket is an attached screen through which the ground beans goes through and an inserted gold basket filter which must be in place in order to make coffee.  On top of all of this is a cover which fits over the basket into which hot water is pumped up over the grounds and then drips down into your fresh grounds.On this cover, there is a dial setting which you must set each and ever time depending on the amount (and what I've discovered -- strength) of the coffee you want to have.  Finally, this entire assembly is covered by a lid attached to the rear of the coffeemaker and latches in front.The entire internal assembly MUST be cleaned after each and every brewing.  So, yes, if you make multiple pots, you need to clean it each time.  (However, is this any different than any other coffee appliance?)There are additional settings on the front of the coffeemaker that also affect the quality of the coffee; so, basically, the coffeemaker is NOT intuitive and you have to read the instruction manual before you start brewing coffee with this appliance.All of that said, this coffeemaker makes EXCELLENT coffee.  I own two of them, because I originally purchased the version in white, because it was all that was available.  When the version in black became available, I bought a second one.  Both are still in excellent working condition and I haven't had any problem with either.The Cuisinart Coffee Bar is a little pricey, but it does make great coffee and I heartily recommend it.",4.0,"Pricey, but good coffeemaker",975715200,"12 2, 2000",Home_and_Kitchen,1.0,,

I wanted a device that I could read outside in bright Texas sunshine between classes, or cuddle up before bed under a light with...Like 99% of people out there, it came down to the Kindle vs the Nook...They both boast pretty much the exact same screen, with the exact same size...the Kindle just has the added physical keyboard while the Nook uses a touch interface so simple/intuitive my grandmother was handling it naturally within minutes.The differences in the available markets did not concern me, as all my books are sourced through 3rd party providers, and my library is managed on my computer by a program called Calibre (pronounced Caliber for us Americans).The screen is crisp, very little ghosting, and it only does the black/white screen flash every 6th page turn...something I hardly notice. The unit itself is incredibly light, lighter than a standard paperback, and has a rubberized finish that holds well in my average-to-smaller hands for a guy. The two buttons on either side of the screen are a little hard to push at first, but I've noticed that over the past week, the two I use most have ""worn in"" and, while still requiring a small amount of tension, are plenty comfortable to activate even in a late-night delirious stupor brought on by a case of the one-more-chapter's.Also, due to the touch interface, I find that no matter how I hold the unit, or using whichever hand, I can easily navigate pages. You can page foreward by either hitting one of the two side buttons, tapping the right side of the screen, or making a swipe motion ANYWHERE on the screen.Amazon may have the slightly larger market, but B&N; is definitely winning in the hardware race for best simple tablet.",5.0,Love it.,1312243200,"08 2, 2011",Electronics,1.0,,

I already have an Apple 4th generation iPad, but I couldn't resist on the high quality picture and low price.  After I received the Nook, I immediately rooted with Kit Kat, the latest operating system.  Let me tell you, I am glad that I made the move.  The original Ice Cream Sandwich OS has lag but not Kit Kat.  With Kit Kat, not only the Nook operates much more smoothly, you also get the full Android tablet experience and more apps available from Google Play.I recently stumbled across the XBMC Cine Player Android app in the Google Play store.  With this app, I can now stream over 1500 movies in HD quality for free.  I have been using XBMC for a little while now on both MacBook Pro and Raspberry Pi, though the Cine Player version's library is not as extensive as the MacBook Pro and Raspberry Pi, it is good enough for use when you are on the road like in a hotel or something.  With Kit Kat, I experience very little buffering issue. I can also output contents to a TV via the Nook HDMI adapter.  I believe you can output signal to a TV via Google Chromecast but I haven't tried it yet so I can't be for sure.I highly recommend the Nook if you root it with the latest OS.  I am finding more and more things that I can do with the Nook then the iPad due to Android is an open system.By the way, I use N2A to root my two Nook HD+'s.  With a N2A micro SD card, it gives you the dual boot capabilities.  You can use it to boot Kit Kat or the native Barnes and Noble OS without removing the card.  The N2A card doesn't replace the native OS as the Kit Kat OS is stored in the micro SD card so you don't have to be concerned about voiding the warranty from alternating the tablet OS.Bottom line, the Nook HD+ is already a pretty decent tablet.  One can greatly improve its potential with a simple change to the OS.  If front and back cameras and GPS are not necessities for you, the Nook is a good value tablet for 1/3 of the cost of an iPad.  By the way, I bought an external bluetooth GPS for $16 and it works like a charm with the Nook.  One can expect to spend $100 for an external bluetooth GPS if your IOS device doesn't come with an internal GPS.",5.0,Well worth every penny if rooted with Kit Kat,1400976000,"05 25, 2014",Electronics,1.0,,

Dancer,"[11, 13]","I purchased this player for my 9 year old daughters Acer Aspire One Netbook D255E for her to play DVDs, games and to load Norton 360 on the netbook.  Item arrived quickly in a box combined with other items from Amazon, simply wrapped in one layer of bubble wrap and put in the box.  There were no receipts etc for the shipment, and only a small booklet for installation on older Windows OS systems.  The booklet DID mention that the unit is a CD/DVD burner, but required additional software to do so (I checked on my Acer 5532 laptop after plugging it in and running a diagnostic check, it is only a DVD/CD player).  It also came with a USB driver disc which was unnecessary for my installation, and two USB plugs, one for media and one for power.  Simple to figure out though, just plug in both USB plugs and Windows 7 Starter did the rest.  However, like others with Windows 7 Starter, I had to download VLC Media Player to play DVD's.  No problem there, except for the additional junk that came with the Media player download which I immediately deleted. The CD/DVD player works great now, and sounds especially awesome on earbuds.  I have a Windows anytime upgrade from Starter to full home version ready to install, but I may return it now that I have this DVD/CD Rom working and the free desktop download correction fixed.Cons:  I was let down that so many others purchased the same unit and received a free upgrade to a DVD/CD burner.  That is not a real major setback since this is for a 9 yr olds netbook, but it would have been nice to have as a back up to our other burner.  One for all and all for one I say!Pros:  Easy,  I mean EASY setup.  Also found it nice that you do not need to utilize both USB cables, just plug in the media plug to the USB 2 and that is all required.  Great price considering the seller guaranteed it would work with my Acer One Netbook model.  Free shipping!!!!  Case seems to be sturdy enough, (just don't pick it up and turn it side to side while it is playing).  Region settings available, so it plays most everything.  GREAT DVD picture on both my Acer laptop and the Acer Aspire one netbook, very pleased!Overall,  I would recommend this to anyone needing a DVD/CD rom for the Acer Aspire One Netbook,  provided you do not want a unit for burning CD's and DVD's..UPDATE 01 March 2011:  The more I use this player the more I like it.  The picture on my daughters Acer Aspire one Netbook is sharper than the one on my Acer Laptop with widescreen HD. If you are an Acer Netbook lover, this is the external player for you.  Just a reminder, it is not a DVD/CD burner.Final Update 04-14-2011:  I finally upgraded my daughters Acer One Netbook from Windows starter to Windows 7 and the new OS picked up this player with no external help required for drivers etc.  I also upgraded to 2GB memory, (see my other reviews), which took all of about 4 minutes to accomplish!  My daughter is playing video games and watching DVD movies off this little player like there is no tomorrow!!  I am amazed that this player has performed as it has.  Total thumbs up for quality and performance!!!  I upgraded to 5 stars, simply based on the overall performance and lifespan thus far.

This camera got good reviews regarding its operation and the pictures, etc....and so given the price, I figured I'd give it a shot. I usually buy items on Amazon using the customer reviews.  Seems to be the best way to REALLY tell how a product is.  This was no different.  After reading the 5 and 4 star reviews, it seemed like a good buy.  EXCEPT, that nearly ALL of the 1-star reviews was because the thing leaked...and leaked in far less water than the advertised depth... and quickly.  Given the total reviews and given the total 1-star reviews, I estimated that I had about a 4 out of 5 chance that I'd get a unit that didn't leak...and if that was the case...it would be a good buy (20% of the total reviews were 1-star, and every one of the many I read of the 1-star reviews, was because it leaked).And so in the end, I wasn't so lucky.  Used it in a 4ft pool (so no way the depth was exceeded).  I'm an Engineer for the Navy (Submarines), and I'm very aware how/why things leak.  I'm a designer of underwater electronics.  I checked this thing out fully prior to immersion in water.  Everything was as it should be (with respect to the seals that the user has access to).  But it leaked in about 15 minutes of use.Looking at its construction, while the battery compartment has a rubber cover, the rubber cover doesn't extend to a seam where the front assembly meets the battery compartment.  This, in my opinion, is the likely water path.  And it looks to be a DESIGN issue.  I'm sure they have something in there as a water-block, but it doesn't look like it to me.In my somewhat expert opinion about an item designed to operate underwater, I believe the design is flawed, and you will have about a 20% or more likelihood that the item will leak if used underwater, and probably a much higher likelihood if used underwater often.My guess is it's probably ok to buy if you want to use it in the rain, etc.  But as an underwater camera, don't bother with this one.",1.0,"Took a chance, but it leaks.",1372464000,"06 29, 2013",Electronics,,"{'CS': 0.0, 'MNR': 0.0, 'RB': 0.0, 'RC': 0.0, 'PR': 0.0, 'NR': 0.0, 'FR': 0.0, 'RSP': 1.0, 'AW': 0.0, 'RD': 2.661780105, 'RL': 2124.0, 'ER': 1.0, 'PC': 0.834824091}",0.0

First, you know exactly what six figures you are getting (Obi-Wan Kenobi, Rebel Captain, Rebel Heavy Trooper, Darth Vader, Elite Stormtrooper, and Heavy Stormtrooper).  And, while I would rather have had some new figures to play with, I very much appreciate the fact that you know exactly what you are getting up front.  Further, if you happen to need one or more of these figures/maps, it's definitely worth buying this starter.  Second, the Obi-Wan Kenobi figure was originally a very rare figure from the Rebel Storm set, and the Darth Vader figure was originally a very rare figure from the Revenge of the Sith set.  Thus, until now these figures were harder to get and therefore fairly expensive.  But, now you can get them both for one low price.  Third, though one side of the map was previously released in the Revenge of the Sith Ultimate Missions book (the ""Chancellor's Starship/Thrown Room Map"" map), the other one was previously released only as a promo (the ""Korriban - Valley of the Dark Lords"" map).  So while previously available, most people will likely not have one or both of these maps.  Finally, the set includes a D20, latest rule book, and force/damage counters, so if this is the very first Star Wars minis item you are purchasing, you will still be able to have a fairly fun game right out of the box.In sum, if you already have the figures and maps listed above, you will not need to buy this starter set.  But, if you don't already have these figures or maps, it's definitely a very good buy for the price.  Further, if you are new to the game and just want to give it a try, this is a very inexpensive and reasonable way to do so.",4.0,An inexpensive way for new players to try the game (and experienced players will at least know what they are getting up front),1185235200,"07 24, 2007",Toys_and_Games,1.0,,

The artwork is fantastic and the quad fold board is quite large (although not as large as the 80s version). Retains all the gameplay of the original but with new characters and monsters. They dropped the 80s reissue mechanics of wounds and healing, and ambushing other characters.Now for the components. The board as mentioned is very high quality with great artwork. It isn't large enough to put the monster cards in the rooms so there are these little tokens you have to use to keep track of what monsters/treasures are where. This works pretty well although slows gameplay down somewhat and you only get 12 markers which may not be enough, although I haven't played enough to run out yet. Alot of the most important gameplay tables and information is printed right on the board so you don't have to constantly refer to the rule sheet which is a nice touch.The monster treasure cards are very nice although a bit on the thin side. But they're no thinner than the cards on the 70s and 80s versions of the game. For the price, you can't really expect thick card stock.The various tokens though are heavy thick stock and double sided so you don't have to fiddle with flipping them right side up. The character tokens are two piece interlock and are serve their purpose but I'm a bit worried that overtime they will loosen and not stay together. The included six sided dice are standard fair. The rule book isn't really a book. It's a cleverly folded single sheet of paper printed on both sides but it can be read without unfolding it like a roadmap.All in all a great buy for those that grew up with the originals and also a great way to introduce younger kids to the classic dungeon crawl experience.",5.0,Worthy successor to the old original,1370044800,"06 1, 2013",Toys_and_Games,1.0,,

I have had to replace 5 bands all in the period of 4 -5 months.  I have had 3 of the 4 Suunto's shut down in less the 30 feet of water.  (Suunto claims they are water resistant to 80 meters on thier advertising however when you return them after they stop working in less then 10 meters they claim the warranty does not cover swimming.  Hmmmmmmm swimmers and divers usually look at the water resitance of a watch to mean they are water resitant while swimming.  Unless I am messed up and doing it wrong.........do most people wear the watch on thier wrist or do they just drop it down in the water and go back to check to see how deep it is or how much time they have spent in the water.  Anyway, enough ranting on a cheaply made but exspensive watch that the company does not care enough about it's customers to replace or fix it under warranty.

Even at the sale price, it turned out to be a waste of money!First, the bar ends that rest against the door frame are hard plastic, not foam pads like on the Iron Gym.  The hard plastic ends will almost certainly damage a wooden frame. Heck, even the Iron Gym's foam pads eventually wore through the frame's paint, so I have no doubt that this model will do worse.Second, the bolts that connect the top cross-bar are not recessed into the bar like they are on the Iron Gym.  In fact, on this model, the bolt heads stick out further than the rubber pad that is supposed to protect the wall!  These bolt heads will definitely leave marks on the wall above your door frame.Third, the handles are straight, not angled as shown in the product picture.  This probably ticks me off more than the above problems, as I wanted the angled grip for wide pull-ups, and this was one of the reasons I chose this over another Iron Gym bar.Fourth, this uses very thin bolts compared to the ones on the Iron Gym, and they are not plated like the Iron Gym's.  I bet these will rust quickly.So, bottom line is this is an inferior design and doesn't come as advertised. It only cost me an Andrew Jackson so it's not worth sending back, but I recommend you shop around and compare the build quality before buying.  Note that most of the others that look the same probably are - look closely at the pictures and compare the bar ends that rest against the frame.

This was the best ice cream I have ever had! I used a recipe right from the included instruction/recipe book for strawberry ice cream. My family absolutely loved it. I had purchased some fresh strawberries just to eat and decided to make ice cream with them on a whim. I cannot wait to make more. I have never written a review on a product before but was compelled to do so after tasting the ice cream. I have never made homemade ice cream before this. I was so pleased that I did this alone and everything came out perfect the first time. The instructions were easy to understand and the ice cream maker was very easy to use. As many reviewers commented before, the ice cream will be a tad softer than store bought initially but just stick it in the freezer until desired consistency. It is still delicious and ready to eat right after mixing. I did have to wait 2 hours for the strawberries to ""macerate"" but I just ran a quick errand til then. I also washed the bowl and put it in the freezer immediately after purchasing so that it would be ready to use whenever I was ready. I will admit that the price you pay for the ingredients will not always come out less expensive than if you bought ice cream on sale but look at all the extra preservatives and gums you get in store bought compared with fresh ingredients you add. Plus, the taste just does not compare. I bought this at a really great price so that also helps.

It has a built-in digital compass, barometer, and altimeter. I haven't stress tested it, but it is fairly accurate after calibration. (You should read the manual). The compass is a bit sensitive to distortion from other metals/electronics, so best be careful and check twice. Third, it has a good weight, not too heavy, but not too light that I feel it's fragile. I've bumped it against several tables and surfaces but so far has held up quite well.On the negative side, first, it's a bit on the pricier side than a Timex or a G-Shock, but you are paying to differentiate. The Suunto brand name and the black-face watch design definitely stop G-Shock fans to ask what this watch is. Additionally, the Suunto core just doesn't carry the same feel.

In reality, it can be rather drawn out and dull.  If you enjoy collecting coloured cubes, and making limited decisions with your turns for 1-2 hours, then this is the game for you.  If you want a similar kind of game that does this so much better then look at Tzolk'in &#34;the Mayan Calender&#34; game.  This game for me has very limited replayability, as so much of what you can do on your turn is reliant on what others do before you.

What is different about this set is a shocking number of reports about torn and broken bands that often caused serious injuries and even a few cases of disability. Also, it's quite unusual to read these reports in some 4- and 5-star reviews.Usually, I don't pay much attention to 1- and 2-star reviews because it's very common for people to have various reasons for dissatisfaction, which have little to do with the quality and usability of the product itself. Actually, since I was going to use the bands for rehabilitation and the number of positive reviews was overwhelming, I decided that this product should serve its purpose for me and bought it in September 2013. This conclusion appeared to be accurate, and, before writing a regular review, I decided to read again what other people were saying. And this time many reviews sounded very alarming, often, apparently, without the author's intention. What could one think reading a 5-star review that asserts that if the exercise equipment breaks, it is beneficial for the user because this indicates increased power of the user, and the sooner it happens the better? And this opinion was not an exception. Somehow, I didn't feel comfortable using this product and conducted in-depth Internet research on similar products including Amazon reviews. The results are as follows:1. As some reviewers suggested, this product had improved over time, and many reported incidents might not be relevant for new purchases, so it might be prudent to disregard old reviews. Unfortunately, many new positive reviews from 2013 mentioned various quality related issues. This could be due to incorrect use of the bands.2. Similar products sold on Amazon have much better feedback, and complains are about incomplete sets, delivery issues, wrong band size, etc., but not about damaged bands and injuries. And a few products, such as Bodylastics and JS Fitness sets have almost no negative reviews. I have no intention to advertise anything, but one should not look any farther than Amazon to find some alternatives to compare and make a choice.3. The bands certainly should not break in a few months and even years unless they are defective or damaged by inappropriate use. Of course, some drivers can wreck a perfectly good car in a few months, but it doesn't indicate they've become superior drivers. If the active or working length of a band is not stretched more than 4 times, the band should serve for many months of daily use.4. There are bands with built-in protective devices, such as inclosing sleeves and enclosed cords, which should prevent possible injuries and traumas in case of band failure.5. The flat bands might be a better alternative since their length and, therefore, resistance can be adjusted much easier. They can be folded multiple times if needed, which increases both resistance and reliability. There are extremely heavy duty flat or loop bands suitable for heavy lifting and body building.Practical recommendations:1. Inspect every band thoroughly on arrival for any possible defects.2. Test every band carefully with gradually increased load and inspect thereafter.3. Contact the manufacturer in case of any issue and/or question. They have excellent customer service, which I had a chance to verify personally on a few occasions.4. This set should be perfectly fine for light to moderate loads and/or infrequent use.5. Read the enclosed instructions before using the bands. The most important safety instructions are periodic inspections and overstretch prevention.6. If no defects are found after a few uses, the bands are likely to be in a good condition and unlikely to break without any indication of wear and tear, which can be revealed by periodic inspections.7. Avoid stretching the bands more than 4 times their active or working length. Rolling a band around the hand or reducing its length in any other way will reduce its working length. This should not be used to increase resistance (overstretch), but only if there is insufficient room for exercises. Using entire band should always be preferred.8. Using bands attached to a door, wall, post, etc. effectively doubles the resistance, saves room, and allows for greater control and variety of exercises.9. Avoid incidental cuts, pinches, scratches, etc., which can damage the band. Always inspect bands after using them in some unusual way and/or by another person.10. If the items above sound like too much hassle, consider buying more reliable and, possibly, more expensive bands with protective sleeves or cords, which will give you peace of mind and can actually be more economic.11. Read customer reviews on Amazon very carefully before buying any product if you plan to use it for vigorous and tough exercises.P.S. A huge number of trivial positive reviews might be caused by the ""free orange band reward"" promised by the manufacturer for a fair review, which can encourage many people to write a few words instead of agreeing with already existing reviews, which would have been much more convenient for new customers.",3.0,Band Reliability Review,1396051200,"03 29, 2014",Sports_and_Outdoors,0.0,,

While the ""fin"" motif design is undeniably cool to look at, I can't help but wonder exactly what use is intended for this knife.  It's too large and heavy for most fine work, but its design isn't really optimized for use as a woodworking survival blade (fairly shallow grind, relatively thin blade, weak tip, etc.).  Its aggressive styling, tapered top edge (presumably could be sharpened...), and sharp pointed glass-breaker at the pommel suggest a tactical or fighting knife, but the handle design really allows only one reasonably secure, conventional grip position (i.e. no good overhand grip).  The curve of the knife and handle ergonomics also yield a somewhat unusual almost kukri-like forward sweep to the blade.  I imagine this might be handy for chopping, but it makes blade handling seem a bit less intuitive for other applications.While I am a fan of Kydex sheaths, this one has a couple quirks.  First, the handle retention strap with snap closure sits too low on the belt loop (close to the top of the sheath), mainly as a result of the curvature of the handle.  This, combined with the position of the sheathed knife's center of gravity, means that the knife will tend to flop around if suspended using the belt loop alone.  The second issue I encountered is that the blade was initially an extremely tight fit in the sheath, to the point where repeated insertion and removal of the knife started to wear smooth spots on the textured paint coating the blade.  This seems to have improved over time, particularly after oiling the blade, but there has clearly been some surface-to-surface wear along the way.  Now ""broken in,"" the sheath provides security, but also an easy draw...thankfully no longer a two-hand operation.Overall, this knife is a great value for the price...just keep in mind that it's a bit of a triumph of form over function.  It probably won't be much help in processing firewood, and I wouldn't recommend it if you have any likelihood of encountering actual hand-to-hand combat.  In fact, on further reflection, this may be the perfect zombie apocalypse knife...",4.0,"Cute, but...",1309046400,"06 26, 2011",Sports_and_Outdoors,,"{'CS': 0.818182789, 'MNR': 0.0, 'RB': 0.0, 'RC': 7.0, 'PR': 57.14285714, 'NR': 14.28571429, 'FR': 0.142857143, 'RSP': 0.0, 'AW': 1384.0, 'RD': 0.773584906, 'RL': 2190.0, 'ER': 0.0, 'PC': 0.392596747}",0.0

Now this book, independent of the other, was quite useful when I sat at the 1-2 No Limit game at the MGM Grand and also when I played the 2-4 at the Tropicana in their Poker Room.Previous to reading these two books by Cloutier and McEvoy, I had finished three by Sklansky.  I found that by following Sklansky's Small Stakes Hold'em I was playing far too conservatively to win.  The blinds were eating me up and I rarely got any good cards to enter pots with.  The opinions of Cloutier and McEvoy are far more practiceable I believe.What we have here is a weed's eye view of what one should do when playing pot limit and no limit hold'em.  There is some overlap with the other book but both are valuable on their own.  The authors conclude that pot limit requires more skill than limit but that no limit requires the most skill of all.While I was in Vegas, outside of the Rio where the World Series of Poker was being held, I did not see any mention of pot limit games but I've been in them a couple times online and have to state that it's one a most exciting variety of poker.  It can get crazy fast and the book is quite insightful in describing the way in which one should specifically play.The reader is given crystal clear advice on what to do in particular situations and the two authors seem to cover every single contingency that should arise.  I was helped by the plain language and non-condescening prose of these two champions.  I also liked the practice hands that were included.

Unfortunately the strap on this bag could be a bit more thicker than it is. Not too thin...but for a gal that carries alot like me...It was not thick enough at all.As far as the feel, the bag is a okay nice faux leather feel. Very soft. Not bad.The drawstring is nice, I had no complaints as far as the detailing goes on this bag, I loved the little pocket that hangs on the outside if the bag. So the details were ok.But because the leather is so soft along with the bag being so light weight It didnt stand up well at all. So there is no form to the bag when you sit it down. Honestly there is a split compartment inside the bag and it would be alot better if it were just a open bag. I also think to get your bag to sit upright, you will need a purse organizer with a hard bottom. Because again this bag is very light weight and soft, so the floor of the bag does not have a strong bottom.So finally the major issue that I have with this bag is the SMELL! I suffer from bad allergies and the smell of the bag completely turned me off. I tried airing the bag outside for hours and still the smell was there. geesh!So my final review of this bag is honestly if it were priced at 20 bucks and they could get rid of the smell it would be a nice buy. So I dont like to tell people what to buy, but this just my review on the bag. Take it as you will.

What was most useful about it and why I would recommend this watch for hiking and walking in woods is alone for it's bottom right button on the default screen. When pushed the watch will go from time mode to compass mode for 5-10 seconds. Enough time to pull my map out of my pocket and orient it to north WHILE walking, drop my wrist (without pushing another button) and start pondering about where I am and have been on the trail, where I will get water, where I can camp. I can't stress how much time this saved me and how essential such a simple thoughtful function was. I lost myself on trial twice or three times, each time I realized before too much time had passed because of my Vector. I was walking in a direction the trail did not go and must have missed a turn. If I had to carry a compass in my pocket I would not have used it. I would have been lost and less engaged in hiking, it changed my style and made me a better hiker. It's a classic.Another useful function for the hiker is the alitmeter. If kept in tune to the contours on a map on a daily or bi-daily basis it was pretty very accurate and gave me peace of mind, helping me figure out a few times where I was and how much further on up or down I had to go to run across the trail or how many more miles I might expect to the next water source (which is HUGE in the desert).Buy this watch.

I remember one vacation with friends we must have played this game 25 times over the course of a long weekend.It requires 3 players to play, but really comes into its own with 4 or more players.

It was reasonably accurate (before you bash ABC watches, understand that they don't magically work perfectly. Never rely on one as your primary or sole reference for any of these tasks) and loaded with just about every feature you really need. A few points stick out.Pros:.Countdown timer can be adjusted for seconds-This may seem trivial, but a lot of digital watches (especially G-Shocks) have countdown timers that can only be adjusted for minutes..Lightweight-Easy to forget that it's on your wrist..Leveling Bubble-Really helps when using the compass. I have no idea why the more expensive Core doesn't have this seemingly simple feature..Easy User Interface-Somewhat different from most other digital watches but very easy to figure out without referencing the manual.'.Price-At $160, this is the lower range for ABC watches and the Vector seems to be just as capable as the more expensive models.Cons:.Cheap plastic feeling-I would not want to bash this watch around..Bezel-Cheap feeling and unable to be moved easily..No storm alarm-Barometer line will flash when there is a major drop in pressure but no audible alarm will sound..Batteries-Uses a hard to find battery type. Mine came with a depleted battery and I had to go to Radio Shack to find an expensive replacement.Overall, I would recommend this watch as an introduction to ABC watches.

Jennings ""Little Wing""","[14, 14]","I owned an X6 model that I loved and used for years...but had to return under warranty for repairs: 1) due to faulty circuit design flaw in original models, 2) then due to repeated failure from 'water intrusion'.  Since I purchased through Eastern Mountain Sports, their 'Unconditional Satisfaction' return policy allowed me to replace failed X6s, um, three times.  But, and reasonably so, after the 3rd failure, EMS said they would only give me credit toward a the Military version of the X-Lander or a final cash refund.  Why the Military version of the X-Lander? Because it is the ONLY Suunto 'Wrist Computer' to feature the same button design as their dive computers. In other words....take any other type of Suunto watch into the wild and you risk losing all functions.Let me be clear: I backpack, I hike, I mountain bike, and I sea kayak...all activities that expose you to water, be it ocean, lake, river, a down pour or three days of drizzle.  I'm careful with my gear. But the non dive button models still crapped out.  SUUNTO even says that their watches are 'Water RESISTANT' to certain depth...but if you press anything while exposed to water (and in my case, twice this was just being out in the mountains in the rain), you are at fault and Suunto will not handle any warranty work.My advice is to buy the X-Lander Military version and learn to deal with its display and programming quirks.And buy from shops that have an Unconditional Satisfaction return policy that extends for quite some time.Sending a watch to Suunto USA for repair takes months and is expensive...and you can roll the dice to guess if they actually worked on your watch.Why buy a Suunto?  Their altimeter & barometer functions are spot on and far easier to calibrate. The watch senses your motion and will re-set between alt and baro functions so that you get an accurate reading (and an alarm) when you NEED one.  Their compass function is also very, very accurate.SUUNTO: get a clue and use DIVE BUTTON DESIGN on all of your wrist computers designed for actual use in the field and not as arm candy.",4.0,Top feature is WATER PROOF BUTTONS!!!!!,1210982400,"05 17, 2008",Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,1.0,,

While heavy, it was easily installed by my organization's maintenance staff.  One downside to this product is that while the arm length and location is fairly easy to adjust, I have not been able to easily adjust the pitch of the monitor (angle of the monitor face relative to the ground).  Thankfully when installed it was at an appropriate level for my use and is not a big issue. Another very slight issue is that the arm has the slightest wiggle to it, so that, when the arm is fully extended the monitor is slightly off level.

So when I saw the Screwpull in action, it was a must have. It took several attempts, but now it is so easy, expecially with the hint from a wine store owner friend.  The tendency when opening a wine bottle with this device is to work on a counter or table top supporting the motion.  Wine store owner friend suggested standing clear of a supporting surface and performing the motion in &quot;mid-air&quot;.  I thought no way, I see disaster.  But, it works!  The leverage is more balanced without a surface.  This delightful gadget brings a smile to my face everytime.  No more struggling.  Smooth, easy, and rarely a cork crumble in the wine.  And as in most reviews, your friends will love the performance.  I sought the opinion of three local wine stores for their preference and the Screwpull was their choice; they felt the Rabbit was too fickle and had so many returned for refund.

Gone are any soft songs and tuneful tracks with different instruments and multi layered songs. It is just rubbish pop song after rubbish pop song, and Hackett just sounds out of tune and there is just no interest to any of the tracks. I was really suffering by track 2.

As advertised, not 1 dead pixel.Resolutions excellent.There is a powerbrick with this item (just an FYI).  Haven't had any issues with it.To mount the monitor on the monitor mount, put the backend on first, then put the big base on the 4 feet, screw them in (recommend using a drill on a very low setting to affix it.

It is a good monitor, good response time, awesome resolution.I would do this monitor at 2560x1600 vs a 4k monitor for 4 reasons.1) 4k monitors are $1,000+.  Yes there are cheaper ones but there cheaper because...2) Most 4k monitors run at 30hz.  Basically it means that the monitor can only display 30hz.  THIS monitor displays at 60 hz (which is fantastic).  To clarify, essentially hz is pretty much how much fps a monitor can display per second.  Now you can have a 4k monitor but if your graphics card is kicking at 1000 fps, your monitor will only support 30 fps of it (its a dumbed down version of it but hz matter, and you want at least 60, if not more3) 4k monitors may require more than 1 connection (aka 2 dvi port connections) to run well.4) 4k is still reaaaaly new.  There working the bugs out regarding creating a gaming 4k monitor that isn't over $1000.This is a 30 inch monitor, well under the 700 to 800 pricerange of other monitors that do the same thing as this one.To the gamers out there, loaded up counter strike, awesomenauts, eve online, all ran at this resolution, full screen, no bars.",5.0,Excellent Monitor,1392076800,"02 11, 2014",Electronics,1.0,,

It helps that many of the rules don't kick in until after everybody has taken four turns around the table.It is basically an occupy and hold game for 3 to 5 players, set in 19th Century New York City.  No dice, very little randomness, with elements of bluffing, negotiation, and intimidation.  You occupy wards with a combination of placing ward bosses, and backing them up with political favor tokens.  You earn political favors by bringing immigrants ashore and then organizing them in your wards. There are four immigrant groups, each player will try to control one or two of these groups as she battles to win mayoral elections over a 16-year period.Players can form alliances to beat up whoever is ahead, but if you devote too many resources to these political fights you may lose control of your own base and fall behind your consolidating competitors.Give it a try!",5.0,"Simple mechanics, complex interactions",1376179200,"08 11, 2013",Toys_and_Games,1.0,,

I like the fact that the bands have clips for the handles. I bought an extra set of handles to avoid having to swap out frequently between exercises. As it turns out, a lot of times when I'm working a smaller muscle group with a single band, I won't even use the handle -- I'll just grab the end of the band near the attachment. I also really like the fact that it's easy to combine the bands to increase the weight. I haven't used the ankle strap and I'm not sure if I ever will. I have used the door attachment and it works well when used as instructed.

Later I got an excellent deal on a Tablet & GOD I LOVE IT (now to get a custom skin & cover &lt;3)!!! Originally I bought it mainly because of the e-reader part, but I use it for all sorts of things, & I also take huge advantage of any nearby WiFi.I love that the e-reader part has all kinds of size & font settings & you can adjust screen brightness to your needs. In my case mine is set to white letters with gray/black background & max brightness. Everything is very bright & easy to see & read. I also like the fact that, in the long run, I read a lot so hopefully this saves a few trees :). Granted not every book I want is currently purchasable in E-book form, but there already quite a few books (OK at least 1 or 2 hundred :P ) in my Wishlist. Purchases are easy & I like the double check feature because im the queen of accidental touch screen tapping :). Plus since I do animal rescue & am on a low LOW budget usually there are quite a few good free books as well & an app you can download that helps you find some good free, low cost, & top pick books :).WiFi & otherwise im still getting used to some websites having phone app settings, which ill admit im not all that fond of, but other than that I couldnt be happier! Pages are also easy to see & manage, though a few times Ive overloaded the poor thing which has required a force close :(. Pretty sure thats my bad though. This also happened twice in e-reader mode. I tap too many things at once too fast.In general I wasnt using mine too much at first because I was terrified that Id drop it & or ruin the screen. Since then Ive bought screen covers & use it a LOT more :P. Settings are easy to work with & even the pictures ive added to the ""My Media"" folder are bright & clear. I take online classes, & since most of my tests are multiple choice I find test taking easier & faster on my NOOK. My only complaint overall is that I use some of those pics as wallpaper & since they need to be stretched out for the home page it makes them blurry up close/enlarged. I dont mind that much though. Ive gotten used to it, & not all of the pics turn out blurry if set as wallpaper. Overall I am BEYOND satisfied with my NOOK Tablet, & I HIGHLY recommend it! Long live the NOOK!!!",5.0,Best. Tablet.

I guess I can see why. First of all, those who call Edge of Sanity a melodic Death Metal band are wrong. EOS has never been merely a 'melodic' Death band to begin with; it's just that they stressed melody and the structure of their songs had powerful hooks that grab listeners by their balls. If you go back to the roots of this amazing band, you'll discover that their first three albums are the epitome of old school Death Metal with a proggressive approach.Unorthodox is the 1992 release of EOS, but most of the songs were written between 1989 and 1991. The music presented on this record is very raw in style, crushingly heavy and incredibly powerful. All aspects of Death Metal are served here and they are also enhanced by proggy overtones (remember Dan Swano is one of the biggest progheads ever). Added to the mold of the songcraft are non-metal elements such as piano, keyboards, violin and even cello. Make no mistake though, none of these instruments are used to overpower, but they are utilised to add colour and texture as well as immense variety. As ""Enigma"" kicks off after the short instrumental track, we are faced with strangely accessible time signatures that continue to shift, change and redefine themselves. Right after Dan Swano's clean vocals (also the only clean vocals on the entire album) the intense rhythm work played by Sami Nerberg (and Dan Swano himself) abounds with so much energy that it is hard stay unresponsive to the magic that shines through. ""Enigma"" consists of three 'psalms', namely ""The Blessing"", ""Celestial Dissension"" and ""The Loss of Hallowed Life"". The cerebral lyrical theme is utilised in a call-and-response kind of vocal delivery and with each passing second the riff architecture is further developed. It finally explodes into a chaotic wall of sound. While I happen to like ""Enigma"" best on this record, the rest of songs are far from filler. On ""In the Veins"" and ""Darker Than Black"", Dan's vocals are particularly raw, but not as refined as they are on the later EOS albums. However these vocals seem to fit the music a lot better. Keep in mind that Dan Swano was only 18 when he recorded this album and his vocals are somewhat in the vein of the earliest Doom-Death bands: slow, tortured, yet heavily brutal!""Everlasting"" sees the band experimenting with various textures and the busy interplay during the main passage is stunning. The song structures are tremendously unorthodox (as the title itself suggests) and way ahead of their time. It's a shame this band got overlooked amongst the metal fans. I could name at least 50 Death Metal bands that came ten years after EOS and became a lot more popular. Similarly ""After Afterlife"" is a direct, speedy piece on the non-melodic spectrum of the genre. This sounds like a musical incarnation of entropic nihilism. The rhythm guitar pattern once again destroys (there are plenty of awesome RIFFS to be found here!) and pleases. The slow, seeping atmosphere is built upon wild drumming and throbbing bass figures as Nerberg and Swano experiment with delicate macrohythms to create a tapestry around the composition. Unorthodox is no doubt a different animal. This isn't as progressive as Crimson or as melodic as Purgatory Afterglow, but it's EOS's testament to creativity and originality from way back, the year 1992.",5.0,"Raw, Heavy, and Powerful",1102982400,"12 14, 2004",Sports_and_Outdoors,1.0,,

I wanted a new game to bring to our family reunion, and thought TTR was just the, well... ticket.  I watched it on Amazon, and ordered it when the price dropped a little.  The game has been very well received by our family.  Our youngest daughter, 10, is probably the most enthusiastic, especially after winning the second game we played!  The rules are straightforward, and the game play is simple--players choose one of three possible actions for their turn--making the game as easy to start playing as any of the more well known family board games, like Sorry, Life, or Clue.  It's on par with Risk or Monopoly in that developing a plan will help you win the game, but the game is still enjoyable if played more casually.  Game play is fast once you get into a rhythm.  The bright, colorful, and solidly made game components look to last for years of hard play.  It even comes with a few extra pieces of each color, as a protection against loss.  The availability of expansion modules (USA 1910, Switzerland) and companion editions (Europe, Marklin (Germany) and Nordic Countries) means if you like TTR, you'll be able to play variants for years to come.  (My 13 year old daughter has already asked for TTR Europe for Christmas.)  A real bonus is the key that comes inside the game, enabling you to play online at the Days of Wonder website.  You can play solo against capable ""bots,"" or test your skill against hundreds of online human opponents.

Before opening the box, I went to Amazon to see how it was being reviewed, and was somewhat concerned at all the bad reviews.I nonetheless decided to open it, and have used it several times so far to make smoothies to good results.Granted, I've only had it for a couple of weeks, so I could be disappointed in the future, but I did want to address my own experience about a few things that recurred in the reviews.-One person said the jug has no pour spout. Perhaps Cuisinart have changed the design somewhat, because mine certainly has one, although a bit small. But overall, no problems pouring into glasses.-Several people have mentioned that the blades just spin at the bottom and that in order to get them to actually blend things, you have to keep pushing things down with a spoon. This has completely not matched my experience. I followed the instructions to use the ""liquefy"" speed for smoothies. When using fresh fruit they were completely and smoothly liquefied within approximately 20 seconds. When I used frozen fruit it took a little longer (a couple of minutes). In both cases I didn't need to use a spoon to push them down.-I did learn after a couple of uses that it's very important to make sure that the jug is pushed in all the way before you use it, because otherwise the plastic blade-spinning device may just spin in the air or may work but with tiny bits of plastic coming off it. When the jar was pushed all the way in, I had no problems with this. However, I am keeping a close eye on that plastic bit because it seems to be the cause of most problems here.So overall to date I'm happy with my purchase. I gave it four stars because I'm not sure how it would react to really heavy-duty use and because I am concerned about the plastic blade-spinner per the reviews here.

While many top racers wear it, I would highly recommend it for the serious hiker, climber or backcountry skier for it's solid construction, design and versatility.While I also wear this as my everyday watch, it's extra large size should be taken into consideration if that's something you have in mind.There are a couple other brands available in this market segment, but the relatively low price and exceptional feature set are what continues to set this tool apart from the crowd.Here's what you should know:* Expect to replace the battery at least once a year. This is due to a number of reasons, one of which is the powerful backlight on the face that when activated can nearly illuminate the inside of a small tent at night. If you believe the manufacturer's warnings and want to play it safe, you may want to have this procedure performed by a professional (watch, not outdoor) shop. Suunto sells a battery pack that comes with a replacement seal and screw-in back, and this is definitely something to consider every other replacement opportunity, but you can get by with a lower-cost Duracell type 2430 3V lithium if you're on a budget.* The altimeter is one of the strongest features, allowing you to quickly pinpoint your location on a topo map. However, plan to reset it regularly, especially after a plane ride or frequent and significant changes in altitude, or weather. This is rather easy as along as you have a confirmed location metric, but you have to remember to do it regularly to ensure the greatest accuracy. The 24-hour memory provides a total measurement of your ups and downs (ascents and descents) over that time period, a really cool record for runners, mountain bikers and skiers.* The compass is one of the strongest in this class of devices, which to be sure isn't the greatest to begin with ... but even the serious orienteerer would be impressed. The ability to adjust for local declination is really nice.* The barometer is good, but not great. However, if you want to be aware of potential weather changes, this will provide you with some peace of mind. Better to be safe than sorry (or worse) in this regard.* The thermometer isn't accurate at all unless you take the watch off for 15-20 minutes or so to eliminate the warming effect of your skin/body temperature.* Some of the controls and settings are not easy to comprehend or remember. I've never been able to figure out how to use the stopwatch, timer and lap features. If you're a swimmer or triathlete and this is important to you, look to the Timex Ironman standby.* Waterproofing is rock solid. No worries.* The soft-rubber watchband is comfortable to wear, but will deteriorate over time, even more rapidly in chlorine. Suunto offers a much lighter nylon/velcro alternative that I personally prefer.Overall, I really like the Vector. But for a number of reasons already mentioned, would not feel comfortable giving it a perfect 5.0 score. But consider my 4.0 more like a 4.7 ... you can't go wrong here.",4.0,"Essential tool for serious hiker, climber, adventure racer",1108944000,"02 21, 2005",Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,1.0,,

I would estimate that we have used it 30 times, tops.  I can not recommend this product because of a fault in its design.  The motor drive is especially a long screw made of metal with threads at its end.  The threads are used to attach itself to a hard black plastic wheel with teeth/groves.  The metal used, however, is soft and brittle that will break thus not allowing the motor drive and wheel to be attached.  This leaves a nice looking blender that has a perfect motor & attachments only it doesn't blend because of this poor design.I did take pictures to better explain the issue with the Cuisinart blender as well as my replacement with a better design.I have alternatively replaced the Cuisinart Blender with a an cheap Oster 6803 about a month ago (bought from WalMart for $24).  It is not as pretty as the Cuisinart but it has double the available speed @ 14 speeds, breaks/blends ice within smoothies better, and its motor drive is a much better design.

The item arrived well packed, accompanied by a very small instruction manual / recipe booklet combination.To get a feel for the machine, I first froze the freezer bowl for 24 hours at zero degrees or less.  My first attempt was a Quince sorbet from ""The Sweet Life"" cookbook.  I pretty much followed the recipe instructions to the letter.  I poured the chilled quince mixture into the frozen bowl with the machine running.  10 minutes passed.  20 minutes.  30 minutes.  40 minutes.  My ""sorbet"" was just a frozen drink.  Eventually, the freezer bowl defrosted and I had a lukewarm smoothie on my hands.Thinking it was my ability to follow a recipe, I decided to try one of the recipes in the instruction manual.  I tried the ""basic vanilla"".  After about 20 minutes of churning, the ice cream started to firm up.  But it never got past the soupy slush stage.  So I waited some more...another 20 minutes.  The ice cream was thicker but still a soupy mess.  After freezing the concoction for 3 hours, it was fine, but more like frozen milk than ice cream.Next, my wife stepped in and tried one of her recipes.  Chocolate ice cream.  Same results for her.  A soupy half-frozen mess.I have lost faith in this machine.  I still think the best and most reliable way to make ice cream is with one of those old style churns.  I just don't think this thing gets cold enough.

Actually, my two young children were really disappointed, because I kept telling them that we were making ice cream, and we kept getting ice cream soup.  It turns out that the instruction manual is wrong - 6 hours is NOT enough time to freeze the freezer bowl.  Neither is 12.  It took 16 hours to freeze enough to make very soft serve ice cream, so I'm going to freeze it for at least 24 next time.The good news is that the ice cream is really good.  I used the recipes in the manual for mint chocolate chip and strawberry, and both worked very well and made delicious ice cream.  The texture was smooth, if very soft, and it didn't stick at all.  I did put the ice cream in the freezer to firm up a bit, as we like firmer ice cream better, but you don't have to.What I like best about this, as a mom with young kids, is the ease and safety of this machine.  You just pour the ingredients in the top and flip a switch.  The kids did it all, and I wasn't worried about mess or injury.

I bought these bands because I wanted a resistance band that I could quickly adjust (which equates to quicker/efficient workouts!).  The clips are strong and the nylon that bridges the band with the clip is durable.  The bands themselves are infinitely better quality than anything you'll find in a local store, yet at a fraction of the price.  I do own a pair of the Lifeline TNT cables, so as an unbiased customer, I owe it to the community to make comparisons.  The main difference between the Lifeline TNT cables and the Saber Bands is the quality of the band itself.  In terms of durability, the Lifeline TNT cables are ""available by prescription only"" while the Saber Bands are the ""extra strength over-the-counter medication"".  If you are a gym-rat meathead that bench presses 300 lbs as a warm-up set, then the Saber Cables doesn't provide the 100-pound cable that you would need.  If you are anyone else, the Saber Bands will be more than enough.  I think the Saber Bands beat out the TNT cables on many levels: (1) you aren't limited by only 3 cables, (2) adjusting the resistance is a cinch (if you have 1 cable on the TNT handles and want to add one more, you have to detach the 1 cable then re-attach 2 cables), (3) it's much lighter and less bulky, making it ideal for travel/outdoor training, and (4) it is more than decently priced (I feel like I'm ripping off the seller for once!).

I had previously purchased some bands from a store that had athletic/workout equipment to do p90x, but when I got home to try them out, they were horrible. They didn't do anything they said they would and had no resistance. It was a complete waste of money. I did a lot of research on my next set and I ended up buying these Black Mountain Resistance Bands. So far they have been great. I was a little worried that there would not be enough resistance due to other people's comments, but they are perfect for me. I use the green, red, and black bands in place of pull ups, and that works well for now. In addition, I have an orange band (35-40lbs) coming in the mail, which in addition to the bands i already have, will definitely be enough resistance even if p90x makes me super buff. The things that I like the best about the bands is that they are high quality, you can strap on all the bands to one handle if you want, meaning you will always have enough resistance, and the door anchor is very easy to use. These are also really nice for me because I have lived in 3 different countries in the last 4 years. I have a set of bowflex weights that go up to 90lbs, but I have had to keep them in storage for the last couple years because they were too heavy to move with. I will be able to take these bands everywhere, and they have a nice little bag they fit into.

When Kindle 2 came out, I decided it was finally time to purchase one, and decided to use Amazon's customer reviews to guide me.  Several things stood out to me that I believed would be a problem for me in the future that I could not overlook:  the proprietary nature of the Kindle e-book format and inability to read other formats, the absence of an expansion slot for an SD card, and the organizational issues that people were having with their books on the device when not using the online services.  After searching for a bit, I discovered that almost all the complaints from Kindle 2 users were addressed by Barnes & Noble in the Nook, including the (limited) ability to loan books (which wasn't really an issue for me, but I could see as a plus in the future.)The device is beautiful, and it feels good in my hands.  It is a joy to read on it, and I find the size is perfect for me.  After I was able to get it out of its substantial and extremely protective packing,I plugged it in to charge per the instructions and proceeded to try it out.  When I pulled up a book that I had been reading using their e-reader software while waiting for my Nook to arrive, it froze on the loading screen and could not be rebooted using any method in their manual.  Upon searching the forums, I discovered that if your device and B&N;'s library are out of sync, the software gets ""confused"" about what page to open to and will freeze.  The solution was to completely remove the battery and plug the machine in without it before re-inserting the battery.  That was rather annoying, but the version update seemed to fix that problem for me.I gave the device 4 stars out of 5 because it has the potential to be perfect, but has a few issues that leave it short of the mark. The first is that the battery management leaves a LOT to be desired.  It simply doesn't perform as advertised.  It sucks battery power like mad (for an e-reader) even with all their power-saving strategies in place.  If you are in a position to charge your Nook every night or ever other night, then this wouldn't be an issue for you.  The second is that the response of the machine is laggy.  I understand that it is improved from where it started, but even so, it is slow to load, and slow to respond to taps and key presses.  Even so, it's still not slower than turning a page in an actual book.  It makes entering anything in via keyboard excruciating.The 3G is amazing.  I love the ability to ""interface with the mother-ship"" as someone on the forums so aptly termed it.  I love the ability to ""hot-spot"" my home network to increase my interface speed.  I love to buy a book from my wish-list on a whim and at the push of a button.  I love the ability to scroll through the book covers to find the novel I want without having to tab through every book I own.  I don't love how much the touchpad sucks the battery.  It's a very cool tool that must be used sparingly, and as such, almost completely takes the advantage of having it away.  I don't like that the entire back has to pop off to get to the battery or the SD card.  I had envisioned buying a batch of cards and using them as a kind of ""bookshelf"".  However, the inability to easily access it takes the convenience of that away as well.  The expansion and extra storage is there, but will only be of efficient use if you want to expand beyond 1,500 books to 1,501 and so on.I had rather hoped that I could replace my book-buying habit with e-books, but have since discovered that not all the books I want are in e-book format, Kindle or otherwise.  No Harry Potter books? That one hurts.  Ender's Game Series? Negative.  Stephen Lawhead? Many of those I can't replace with digital copies.  Oh so much older science fiction that I'd love to have at my fingertips...we're just not there yet.Bottom line, though: if the battery were to last the full 10 days using it under standard reading conditions, if I could easily organize my books into a logical order that I like and not have to use the virtual keyboard to search, and if the response of the system were quick enough to make the virtual keyboard easier to use, it would be everything that I want it to be.  The rest is up to the authors and their publishers.**EDIT 08-23-11**Well, I had to send the first unit back after 7 months of use because one of the arrow buttons cracked in the middle, and I almost exclusively use the window-swipe portion for page turning, which is a feature I really adore.  No problem, they shipped me a new (refurbished, as per the rules) one without no trouble at all.  In fact, they had a new one to me within a few days, at which point all I had to do was package it in the same box and return it.  Great customer service.HOWEVER...over the months since, I have experienced the e-ink display ""greying-out"" a bit at a time.  The text become lighter and more difficult to read.  It would become dark again when I flipped the page, but still disconcerting.  Fast-forward to a week ago.  There was a hardware update for the machine, and once complete, I now have screen artifacts that will not go away.  It started as one horizontal and one vertical line.  I reset it to factory defaults, but it was too late.  More appeared, along with darkening of the screen to the point that I can no longer see anything and have to reset it.  The screen is ruined.  I don't know what happened, but since then it has gotten even worse.  It is no longer possible for me to read on it, it's out of warranty, and I cannot afford to replace it with a 3g version.  So...although I loved it, I no longer trust Nook.  I will miss it, but I think it's time to finally go with Kindle.  Now how the heck am I ever going to replace all those books I bought that I can no longer READ?? I realize that isn't exclusively a Barnes and Noble issue, but I paid for a book that I can no longer LEGALLY read on another device.

The Nook makes it easy to chose a font style, a font size, single spacing or double spacing...you can customize the appearance of the text to your needs.It is easy to read the Nook indoors with any decent room lighting, and easy to read outdoors in the shade.  It is July in Texas...so I have not tried using it in direct sunlight.The Nook is easy and comfortable to hold in one hand for extended periods of time.  Turning pages is easy with a light touch on the side of the screen or a press of the page button in the sideframe.The battery took a couple of full charge/discharge cycles to stabilize. At that point, it was using about 2% of the battery for each hour or two of reading.  Reading an hour or two hours a day and using the Wi-Fi an hour or two per week would result in 3 weeks or 4 weeks per charge.  In contrast, my color e-reader requires charging each day.Magazines look MUCH better on my color e-reader, but magazine text is very readable on the Nook.  The Nooks is at its best with a book with plain text, as illustrations, art, drawings, etc. look crude compared with a color e-reader.I have several books in paperback at home that I also have on the Nook.  Because I can increase font size and use double-spacing on the Nook, it is much easier to read on the Nook than in the paperback book.  My aging eyes feel much better after a couple hours with the Nook than after a couple hours straining to read the ""fine print"" that is typical of lower priced paperback books.If you want an e-reader primarily for magazines, you probably should buy the Nook Color or a small color tablet.

They have had multiple rule updates, and this game is based off of the more recent changes. It plays as a simplified version that is perfect for introducing new players to the series and game play style. My wife who would have never dreamed she would enjoy something Dungeon and Dragons related actually really enjoys this game.It has 13 different scenarios which are like individual games within it. They all come together to form a complete story. You and your band of heroes are trying to protect the town of Bavoria and defeat the lord vampire Strahd. The game is played on a board that grows as you journey the dungeon and is randomized so even playing the same scenario should provide a different experience.In a regular turn you move, explore a new area, fight some monsters and then bring new monsters into the game. There are traps, different environment hazards, and treasure and items to collect and help you out.The game at its core is a story. It has decent combat and the way it handles monsters keeps the game at a decent pace and does not allow it to lull or slow down. But the theme and the story are what drives you. In the last game my wife and I had to find a alter in the dungeon and recover a holy artifact and then escape. The game has a prepared reading to set the mood, and then another once you find the alter. It gets you into the game and makes that quest unique even though you are doing the same thing as in others. If you gloss over the stuff like this and just focus on moving and rolling dice you may not enjoy this game. You have to get into your roles and use your imagination just like in a real game of Dungeons and Dragons.The game comes with miniatures to help with this, little statues for all the players and monsters. They are not painted, but the details are pretty good and it is easy to distinguish between them. There are also tons of tokens for monitoring your life, as well as pretty much anything else the game does. At first it seems overwhelming but it becomes second nature after only a few turns.I have enjoyed this game so far, it works very well as a single player game also which is a plus. It has 2 scenarios specific for this, but it is not so complicated that you can not play 2 heroes at once either. Each game lasts around a hour, and set up takes 10 minutes or so. I would recommend some card protectors as this game is card heavy. While everything is constructed well and appears very durable, a little extra protection never hurts.",5.0,A neat take on a old concept.,1344816000,"08 13, 2012",Toys_and_Games,1.0,,

I did my homework and read lots of very good reviews for this brand.  Well, it worked for half a minute and then stopped.  I kept thinking it was me and that I just wasn't seeing the clean but when I took the 'hand held' part out of the unit, there was absolutely no steam coming out despite the water being full and the pad, upon inspection looked new.  I waited overnight to try it again and this time I didn't even get my half a minute.  I phoned Haan and the agent that I got told me the water has to be COLD.  I explained that I had filled the unit with water from the cold part of the tap and he said, no, it has to be cold.  I asked him, what he meant by that, from the refrigerator?  And his reply was yes, that the sensor cuts off thinking there is no water left if the water isn't ice cold.  I am thinking that this is ridiculous of course, as I do not want to be a slave to an appliance changing the water every 5 min when the temperature goes down, I have enough to do but I tried again, this time with the filtered water I had in the refrigerator and still nothing.  I finally, in frustration, returned the steamer.  I want one that will work really well, I want to see the steam coming out and know that I am cleaning my house.  What I don't want is a finicky product that is far from easy to use!  I realize that I might've gotten a dud but I wasn't going to phone customer service yet again and be told about the 'cold water', I've wasted enough time on this.

It can be dropped into any campaign at any time. It can be used for huge situations in which characters lives hang in the balance of how the cards fall or how they play or it can be used for your standard bar gambling game. So the idea was excellent and the game is actually fun to play. The only problem lies within how characters can influence the game with certain skills that their characters possess. This could have been developed more and could have turned the game into more of an rpg strategy asset. Overall this part of the design is very poor and is really the only thing lacking in this otherwise excellent game. However, if you are looking to play the game outside of a dnd campaign setting the game would not be anywhere near as fun and should drop a star or 2.

The makers of the puzzle did their best to keep the shapes of the continents, countries, states, provinces, seas, etc. so of course there will be some really odd shaped pieces and even a lot of flat-sided pieces within the puzzle. Once it's all together though it stays put nicely, however in the mean time it might be a little frustrating for smaller fingers. A suggestion for this problem is to simply put the puzzle together on a non-slip surface ... and also if you have a smaller child it would be best to do it as a family. We have only put it together once but did so on our dining room table (oak ... slippery). Hindsight says a piece of felt or rubber or something similar placed UNDER the puzzle would have made the job a lot easier.Now the positive: This was a fun family project and all of my children are 16 or older. We all learned a lot about world geography ... I found myself saying &#34;it's probably in Africa&#34; quite a bit!!! Even with a large world map on the wall in our dining room I realized how I never really thought about how many countries are actually IN Africa but now I know. I now see that large world map a lot differently and we all look forward to assembling the puzzle again.Another positive is that I believe it was a very fair price for the product.Neutral thoughts: Before I got the puzzle I was wondering what it would look like. I wondered if each state in the US would have its own piece? No, they do not. Some of states, provinces, countries, etc. do SHARE a piece and the pieces are not EXACTLY the shape of the state, province, country, etc. This did not take away from the learning experience though.Highly recommended!",4.0,We enjoyed this puzzle a lot!,1400889600,"05 24, 2014",Toys_and_Games,1.0,,

As one of the Boomers I was looking for a way to keep my hobby of reading lots of titles on a retirement income.  The Nook was the perfect answer.  The Nook offered three advantages over the Kindle.  1.  I don't have to send it in to replace the battery.  May seem like this is not a big deal to some but like most personal hand held or computers its personal.  2.  The share books feature.

I'd wanted an ice cream maker for years, but could never quite decide what brand to get.  I figured if a product was being used on Food Network, it would at least work like it's supposed to, and given the nice price tag on the Cuisinart, I decided to give it a try.  I don't think I'll ever find the need to buy ice cream again... the product that this maker puts out is AMAZINGLY good!  And it's sooooo easy!So far I've made basic vanilla ice cream with frozen bites of eggless cookie dough mixed in (yum), ice cream made with two packages of butterscotch Jell-O pudding (YUM), and just five minutes ago, peach frozen yogurt (*dies from the yum-osity*).  I have plans to make chocolate frozen yogurt this afternoon and strawberry ice cream and mango sorbet tomorrow, then I'm hauling all my homemade noms to a friend's house for a birthday celebration.  We might pass out from the sheer goodness of all this ice cream, let me tell ya!I did read through several reviews of the machine and took some tips into consideration, so for those who are having problems getting this machine to work properly, I offer this:- When you freeze your bowl, make sure your freezer is turned really low... I always keep mine at the lowest setting, anyway, so it freezes very well.  Also, I put a ziploc bag full of ice in the bowl, thinking it might help.  Don't know if it does, but my freezer bowl starts thickening my ice creams almost immediately and only requires a couple hours in between batches to re-freeze, so maybe it does help.- I mix all my ingredients in the quart Ziploc twist containers in which I plan to store the finished product.  That way I can A) give my ingredients a good shake before pouring into the mixer and B) I also stick the containers either in the back of my fridge for 20-30 minutes or, sometimes, into the freezer for 10 minutes or so.  My fridge is set to super-cold (about 32 degrees or so) most of the time, so chilling the ingredients like that also helps a lot.  My ice creams usually start thickening within 5 minutes and by the end of the 25 minutes are an absolutely perfect soft serve consistency.- If soft serve isn't your thing, just put the ice cream/frozen yogurt in your quart container and freeze it for awhile.  It may sound like a lot of steps to get ice cream, but it's really not that much work and it's WORTH IT.The only things I haven't really experimented with are using ingredients that have to be cooked, then cooled, first or having the machine mix in any add-ins (when I made the cookie dough, I mixed it in by hand because my ice cream maker was too full for me to add anything else to it).  I am sure I will try new recipes as the weeks go on and I am already planning to buy a couple extra freezer bowls so I can make some big batches of ice cream.  All in all, I give this ice cream maker two thumbs up and a wink for good measure!",5.0,Never buy ice cream again!,1269561600,"03 26, 2010",Home_and_Kitchen,1.0,,

In my experience, games that are specifically designed to be educational often lack any actual gameplay.Thankfully, this was not the case with Application Crunch. The game plays with a very ""Eurogame"" feel with cards dictating the number of actions you get each turn. Each player also has a character class, which is essentially a high school clique stereotype that gives that player a small advantage for performing various actions.Overall my students and I enjoyed the game. It had a surprising amount of decisions to be made while still playing quickly and not leading to any kind of over-analysis that can bog down a game. It also very much gave a feel of that senior year rush when a student has 20 things they want to do and only 4 hours of free time. All that was conveyed well and drove home the importance of prioritizing.So overall, this game is a fantastic recommendation for a high school club - or even better a guidance office. The only drawback is it still has a deck of cards that ask questions about preparing for college. That gives it the scent of ""educational"" game that scares off many of my kids from voluntarily playing it when they are faced with an entire cabinet of choices.So I would rate it 5 stars as an educational game. And 4 stars as a game where education isn't the primary goal.",4.0,Good game - especially for an educational game!,1332288000,"03 21, 2012",Toys_and_Games,1.0,,

For the price of two bands from a sporting goods store, I got 5 bands. The quality of the tubes are great, all the inter connects are good quality. I like the setup of these bands better than the bands with the handle permanently for the fact that you can adjust the resistance to your liking. I decided to give these a go one time on P90x, and they worked great. Nothing to complain about, gave great resistance, and a great workout over all.The ankle strap is of great quality and the bag is good for when traveling and don't have access to weights.

I bought two sets, as I also ended up purchasing a resistance band door anchor and didn't want to have to always change out bands.  Having two sets has also allowed me to increase my resistance options and to do things like simultaneous biceps curls, etc., using heavy resistance.The Black Mountain resistance bands have been great.  There's a great assortment of resistance weights.  The pamphlet that comes with the product not only has some great exercise illustrations, but also lists all of the weight options on the cover (for ~10 pounds, use this band, for ~60 pounds, use this combination of bands, etc.).  Prior to my Black Mountain order, I had purchased a set of resistance bands from a different company and was very disappointed in their product.  The bands from the other company simply stated that the bands were ""easy, medium, and heavy.""  I had no idea what the bands roughly equated to in terms of weight.  Additionally, the previous bands were cheap.  The grips were poorly made, and all of the attachments were plastic.  The Black Mountain resistance bands are definitely a high quality product.  The grips are all of good quality and all of the attachments are solid metal.  It's nice not having to wonder if the plastic is going to break on me in the middle of the exercise, resulting in an elastic band to the face.I would definitely recommend this product.",5.0,Great Product,1392768000,"02 19, 2014",Sports_and_Outdoors,1.0,,

Beadle ""Entrepreneur""","[3.0, 4.0]","I have a fairly moderate home theater system:  large format HDTV, DirecTV, Onkyo Amp/Video switch, Roku, Wii, and DVD.  That's four inputs and one output.  I don't consider that complex.This is my second Harmony remote.  Between them, I have had a couple of professional systems: URC and Philips, along with Roomie Remote for iPad.  All have cool features, but none have it all.  Philips was the closest to filling the bill, but Philips recently locked down their software, making my $500 Philips system a boat anchor.From there, I tried Roomie. It is actually quite nice, exploiting Net connectivity with fancy program guides.  But it doesn't have tactile feel.  I wanted nice buttons that my fingers could find in the dark.So... I went back to Harmony.  Big Mistake.  I wasn't happy with the first one.On the plus side:They have made huge improvements since my last Harmony. In the early versions, the ""Chicklet"" keys were flimsy.  I really like the look and feeling of this unit.The touch screen is a nice addition.  WIth 500 channels available, i can't watch them all. I was able to put the 25 or so that I do watch a touch buttons on the display.  This was WAY easier than with the Philips professional system.Most of the hard buttons are easy to find and work as expected.The software is easy to set up - as far as it goes.  If you follow the directions, ""Programming"" takes about 10 minutes.  On Philips, it took several hours.But....I DVR many programs.  I want a hard button to skip forward/backwards.  On my Philips, I programmed a button to Skip 6 forward - the typical time for a commercial break.  On the new Harmony, this is a touch screen button hidden below three menus.  It clearly isn't something to invoke simply with motor memory...  This is a deal-breaker for me.The User Manual is very skimpy.  It covers basic programming, but little on use.  One of the interesting feature is ""gesturing"" like on iPhone.  Cool concept, but zero instruction about what the gestures are.  It would be great if they had a ""skip commercial"" gesture, but NO.  So far, I have found this feature useless.  Edit...  After a week I did find the help screen on each command provides some of what should be in the manual.  The gestures are a little more useful than I had realized. I can swipe left to right to fast forward.  Swipe again and the pace increases.  Tap and it stops and plays.  There is more guesswork than with a skip 30 seconds button, but it does work.  I have added a star.Adding unusual devices isn't handled well, as far as I can tell.  I have Roku.  It uses WiFi for remote control.  No luck with this remote (And I knew that in advance), but I haven't found a way to customize features.  For example, in Sat mode, the CH up/down buttons go to the DirecTV box as expected.  But in Roku mode, the CH buttons change from HDMI1 input on the TV to over-the-air mode.  So if I am watching Roku and inadvertently touch Channel, i get static.  I tried going back to ""HOME"" and selecting Roku again, expecting it to select HDMI1 - NOPE.Overall - This would be a really cool remote at $79.  But at $250, not so much..  For even low-end home theater systems, this remote just doesn't have the needed flexibility.  Edit.

All of these features are from personal experience with the product over three years of use:- It can easily fit into a backpack and will not damage the stuff you put it in with (no major pinch points)- It accommodates a broad variety of medium to large textbooks (it handled my 900 page electronics text beautifully)- It has a very nice viewing angle for desk work (minimal head craning to move from notes to book)- It saves space on your desk from traditional use (dorm room desks are horribly small)- It is pretty sturdy and can be dropped repeatedly (unlike many other book stands/holders)- It is easy to slide around on a desk (this could be good or bad, good if your workspace changes a lot)- If you put a mass market paperback into it, it will slide around and pages are hard to turn.- The folding mechanism is sturdy and the product can stand up to all kinds of bending (friends jokingly tried to break it all the time)- It doesn't look flashy, but people comment all the time on how nice a stand it is (especially other students; I bought one as a well-received gift for a roommate)- You can highlight books in the stand, but you can't easily write on them (it will slide)I'd recommend this product for the hardworking note-takers. It's a robust product that can be thrown into a bag, slid around on a desk, and subjected to all kinds of tomes. It'd even make a nice gift for a new college student, who might not appreciate it at first, but will grow to love it like I have.If you're buying this for mass market paperbacks, it's a 3-star product.

Truth be Told game is that game in a different form.  When I opened up the box, I was curious what the questions would be like.  The premise of the game sounded like a lot of fun!  But, as I began to read the questions, I realized that there was the potential for a lot of the questions to go wrong or go in directions that I wouldn't be comfortable. The questions' topics held a lot of potential for hurt feelings, as another player said, and for potty humor to enter the game.  You'd have to be in a group in which everyone enjoyed potty or crass humor, or had very sarcastic senses of humor, or were committed to answer the questions innocently instead of taking them down other paths.  If the group all fell within one of those categories or the first two together, you'll probably enjoy the game.  The questions are creative and it would get people talking and laughing.  If on the other hand you're looking for a fun and innocent game--then don't get this one.Post script... if you are wondering why I didn't just take a few cards out and enjoy the game as is, well...

Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[15, 15]","When the hot days of summer are looming, nothing can be more refreshing than one or two scoops of your favorite ice cream.  Of course, it's easy to go to the frozen food section of your nearby grocery store to buy ready-made ice cream; but there may be a problem: if you're concerned about your weight and on the Atkin's Diet, most ready-made ice creams have too many carbohydrates that defeat the purpose of the diet.  So the question becomes, can you still enjoy a delicious, cold scoop or two of ice cream and remain on the Atkin's Diet?  Yes, but you need ice cream that is very low on carbohydrates and the best way to have that is by making your own ice cream at home.The Cuisinart ICE-20 1-1/2-Quart Automatic Ice Cream, Frozen Yogurt &amp; Sorbet Maker is probably the best and easiest-to-use home ice cream maker that I have ever used.  You don't have to worry about buying bags of ice and rock salt and you don't have to run it outdoors for being too loud. Instead, you simply put the freezing chamber in your freezer (overnight is best); then (once frozen solid) take it out and place it on top of the mechanism on your kitchen countertop.  Next, put the plastic blades inside the frozen chamber and cover it with the plastic shield that covers the chamber and blades while the chamber is rotated by the mechanism.  Through an opening on top of the plastic shield, you can pour your ingredients directly into the frozen chamber, then turn it on.  For the best results, I recommend that you mix your ingredients first in a blender, then you can simply pour the contents of the blender directly into the frozen chamber.  After about 30 minutes, you will have your own homemade ice cream! The best part is that you can make it any way that you want, so if you want to use a non-sugar sweetener (I recommend Splenda), you can and have a very low-carbohydrate delight that is acceptable for the Atkin's Diet!  Also, you can make just about any flavor of ice cream by using any kind of fresh fruit.  I haven't tried making frozen yogurt of sorbet yet, but the ice cream is fantastic!Along with the ice cream maker itself, you also get 4 small glass desert cups (which you can chill before serving), and an ice cream scoop.  All you need to provide is the blended ingredients and the imagination necessary to create a variety of flavors!  Overall, I rate the Cuisinart ICE-20 1-1/2-Quart Automatic Ice Cream, Frozen Yogurt &amp; Sorbet Maker with 5 out of 5 stars for its ease of use and low noise level.  I highly recommend it to any ice cream aficionado, and especially to anyone on the Atkin's Diet!  And here's a helpful hint: there are a lot of ice cream recipes available on the internet!

Given that this mount can support almost twice the weight of my TV, it was a little bit of overkill but better safe than sorry.  The unit is already assembled right out of the box and just needs to be attached to the TV and a wall stud.  I made a quick template by rubbing a blank piece of paper on top of the wall bracket with a pencil. I then used a stud finder to locate the nearest studs where I wanted the TV to be and taped the template to the wall.  I used a drill driver to make pilot holes for the lag screws which helps greatly with getting them in.  I was able to use four of the lag screws.  There is a plastic two piece lag screw cover (included) that clicks together easily over the lag screw heads to make for a clean look.  The wall bracket allows for different screw patterns for easier installation.  Once I had the mount secured to the wall, it was time to attach the TV to its bracket.  This took two of us to do it quickly.  One lifted the TV and the other pressed the bracket flush against the TV and hand tightened the four screws that go into the back of it. This allowed the TV to be supported easier while a screwdriver was used to finish tightening the four screws.  After that, it was just a matter of adjusting the angle of the mount for the best TV viewing.This thing works as advertised.  The extension arm works smoothly and without much effort.  The tilt function has a nut that loosens to allow for pivot adjustments.  The cord management system works well to bundle the various cables and makes for a clean look.

This fan is very good at exhausting inside smoke to the outside.  Also when something starts smoking on the stove and fills the house with smoke, this fan will clear the whole house in less than a minute.  Electric reversing makes three speeds available for either exhausing or bringing fresh air in directly with just the twist of a knob. At medium and high speeds it helps to crack a window on the other side of the house.  Think of it as an 'attic fan' in your window.  Our window are 5' in height and this sits in the bottom 2' and since the window sill is only 8"" off the floor, the fan does not block the view at all except for the dogs.Two things: 1. Closely follow instructions when installing to avoid a noisy fan. Not properly mounted will result in vibration and more noise than necessary. (Also make sure base of fan is firmly sitting on the window sill when mounted...this will almost ensure vibration is minimal) 2. Fan needs to be cleaned at least annually (especially if you smoke).  You can remove 6 screws from inside the house which allows you access to clean the blades and the outside grill.Remember this fan is all plastic construction, fairly sturdy, but be careful not to strip screws by tightening too much.Finally, we've found that we are able to get a lot further into the summer season before we close up the house and turn on the central air because of this fan.",4.0,Essential For Smokers,1360713600,"02 13, 2013",Home_and_Kitchen,1.0,,

However, it was an easy fix.The spine did make a crackling noise, but mine is broken in to the point where it doesn't make the noise anymore. The downside with that was when i had the case folded in (outer covers touching), a nice angle was made, perfect for typing on a desk. That angle is gone now.I haven't cut a slit to make it possible for me writing with my right hand and might not. With the spine broken in, it's easy to fold the case into a size that's not too much larger than the original ipad's dimensions. I can easily have the iPad in the case on the left side of my desk and a spiral bound notebook on my left with enough space to comfortably write.With the elastic not as strong as it once was, I rated the case lower, but I still love it. But I still wish they would come out with an official moleskine case for the iPad.For the last 2 months, I've been searching for a case for my iPad that doesn't make my new purchase look tacky.  I bought the Incase Book Jacket and didn't like the inside leather trim and returned it the next day. I couldn't wait for Moleskine to release an official iPad cover, so I bought the Moleskine Kindle DX Cover thinking that the iPad would fit due to similar dimensions. While the straps are a tight fit, the iPad does fit inside beautifully and doesn't seem like it will be slipping out anytime soon. The top right strap does cover the power button, but its easy to push down on the elastic strap to get to the button for wake/sleep/power. The volume rocker and orientation lock are in no way covered by the strap as well, allowing for easy access. Apple headphones easily fit behind the top left strap, but headphones with an ""L"" shaped plug would probably fit behind the strap more nicely. The bottom left strap covers just one of the 3 speakers but it in no way hinders the sound quality.The only complaint I have is that every time I open the cover, the pages of the paper notebook fan out, but its a problem that can easily be solved with a rubber band.I'm right-handed and the paper does get in the way, but I may cut a small slit on the opposite side of the notebook holder to be able to turn the case around and make it more comfortable for me to use.Could you DIY a moleskine case for the iPad? Sure. Could you wait for an official Moleskine cover for the iPad? Sure. But this definitely gets the job done now and looks beautiful inside and out.",3.0,"For those wondering, it does fit the Apple iPad",1278979200,"07 13, 2010",Electronics,0.0,,

The graphics on the new model are also much harder to discern --for example, the indicator for degrees F or degrees C is tiny (granted that is probably an issue only during set-up). The good folk at Suunto have still not addressed the problem of accidentally uncalibrating the barometric sensor -- that's a problem if you hit the buttons while running -- and the manual still doesn't help you get out of the mess in the field. It was a great product for backcountry activity, now it's mostly for show.

Sparks,"[4, 4]","I bought this game because the 150th Anniversary update included the Battle of Prairie Grove, where my Great-Great-Grandfather fought, and I was interested in ""recreating"" the battle to see what might, or might not, have happened ""if"". [For an excellent book on Prairie Grove, I recommendFields of Blood: The Prairie Grove Campaign (Civil War America).]Each battle scenario is mapped out for you in the instruction book, with terrain, building, and troop placements all specified. Each side is given a number of ""Command Cards"" and the instructions designate which player takes the first turn.Each side has Infantry, Cavalry, and Artillary - as well as Generals and flag bearers. The goal in each scenario is dictated by the rule book, and is based upon the 30 different Civil War Scenarios presented.The ""Command Cards"" determine whether the left flank, centre, or right flank is commanded - and how many units in that area are commanded. You can go from a mere ""scouting"" party, to a full frontal attack - if you have and use the right card. The need for a certain type of ""Command Card"" gives the game an unpredictability that is truly a part of warfare, as do the use of dice rolls to determine the outcome of particular engagements.I found the game both enjoyable and educational. I have learned a lot about strategy, tactics, consequences, and the various battles.I do find the rules a bit ""weak"" in some areas, and have modified a couple of them:1) The game allows that even if only 1 unit is present in a hex, it is still at ""full strength"" and can destroy four or more enemy units. I have modified this so that an army can defeat only the number of units it has present.2) The game does not allow you to split units which are together in one hex. This is unrealistic, as units were split all the time. I have made it so that I can send two units off in one direction, and two in another, if I so choose.3) The game does not allow you to combine units, so if you have only 1 unit left in one hex, and 1 unit left in another hex, they have to remain separated. In reality, this doesn't happen, as units often combined, and in the heat of combat, units often were completely mixed up with other units. I have modified this so that isolated units can combine.4) The game places all pieces who were involved in the battle on the gameboard at the start of the game, without regard for ""when"" they became involved. For instance, at Antietam, AP Hill did not arrive until mid-afternoon, but in the game, he is there from the beginning. I think it would be good to have some kind of ""delay"" of (in this case) 10 turns or so, to give account for Hill's late - and vital for the final outcome - appearance. Likewise at Prarie Grove, Union General Blunt arrived after the battle began, but in the game he is present from the start. A ""delay"" of 6-8 turns would help to make the game more ""realistic"".5) The game does not allow for divisions that were present, but not used. At Antietam, McClellan kept much of his cavalry in reserve, and, as such, they were not a major factor in the battle. They are not represented in the game. A good ""what if"" would be to have the cavalry become ""available"" after a few turns and see what difference they would have made at the ""Burnside Bridge"".These are personal ""quibbles"" and the rules are good as they are. If you want to introduce more ""realistic"" aspects, then modify the rules to suit yourself.As I said, I have enjoyed the game, and highly recommend it to you. Of course, having played the battle - or even before playing the battle, reading up on it to find out who, what, when - will make the game even more enjoyable.p.s. I ended up winning (for the South) the battle of Prairie Grove - but in the process I think that I killed my g-g-grandfather.",5.0,"Great game for re-enactment and ""what if""",1366848000,"04 25, 2013",Toys_and_Games,1.0,,

Roll some dice. Have fun.Dnd is a hobby that requires a lot of dedication and the purchase of at least three rulebooks at around $30 apiece. Many new players/DMs will not know if they like Dnd enough to purchase the books they need, and this product is a great jumping-on point. It clearly outlines most of the basic rules. The key word there, however, is ""basic."" The characters that come with this set do not follow many of the rules presented in the Player's Handbook (for example, skill ranks that are absurdly high) and as such, confusion can be caused when the standard rules are incorporated. The six adventures in this book make up a small but high-quality mini campaign, and your players (I speak as a DM) will be hooked. For the best experience:1. Purchase the core rulebooks (Player Handbook, Dungeon Master's Guide, and Monster Manual) along with this set. Use the miniatures, adventures, and treasure/experience included in this boxed set, but use the standard rules for rolling up (creating) characters and for leveling up that are detailed in the Player Handbook.2. Take the time to fill out character sheets and you will be rewarded. They provides spaces, blanks, and boxes for just about every variable in Dnd, and it's very hard to stay organized without one.3. LEARN THE RULES. This is the absolute most important point. Yu don't need to learn about sundering weapons, grappling, bullrushing, and other advanced tactics until you're experienced, but basic rules like skill/ability checks and combat rolls are a must.Pretty good value for the money, BTW.REMEMBER: THIS IS THE 3.5 EDITION OF DND.

So it would only be logical that I would have my kindle cover replaced by this one. This was a no-brainer.I tried it out last week but I was disappointed by the poor design and the untested usability.First: poor design: this cover is really too thick an fat - not only compared to the Moleskine notebook covers but most of all compared to the original Kindle cover. I would have expected an (even) more elegant design as the standard Kindle cover (which is a fine piece of art I now realize). However, what I got instead was a plump, thick and heavy cover that may have the Moleskine imprint but nothing elegant.Second - and this is way I am returning this object: the wrappers that hold the kindle - especially the one in the top left hand corner block the device's on-off button. So you have to fiddle with both hands only to find that the wrapper holds the switch from returning to its original position. As a result my device was reset several times just because of the cover.In short: inelegant and untested .Return to sender... sorry!By the way: unlike all that is being told in the other comments I found the left positioning of the notes not to be a negative thing (unless you would be reading and writing simultaneously, which - as a man - I have no intention of doing). From my experience the Moleskine notepad that is included is a good thing and it is in the right place... `left' that is.",1.0,Inelegant and untested ... sorry!,1277683200,"06 28, 2010",Electronics,0.0,,
{'$oid': '5a13242d741a2384e88f4814'},A1DB9VACW58HQQ,1400599997,Donna Y,"[5, 5]","I did a lot research about different e-readers before purchasing the Nook.  It had really came down to these main criterion for my purchase:1. Is it simple and easy to get books online, does it use a book buying web format I am accustomed to?2. Will I make back some of my investment on the device by deals on ebooks?3. Is it simple and fun to use, comfortable to hold, and do I look cool using it?4. Can I test drive before I buy?Some of the things I was not concerned with were:1. Listening to music, audio books and being read to.2. Name brand of device.The Nook won out for several reasons.  First, at the time I was buying it (February 2010) Barnes and Noble ebooks were actually the same price or slightly cheaper then Amazon's.  This was the case for many of the books I was most interested in reading (leisure reading).  I also was already familiar with Barnes and Nobles website's format and functionality (the way the colored touch screen interfaced with their website was really visually pleasing).  I also like to mull around in Barnes and Noble stores, and liked the feature that you can read books for free (for an hour) while in a store.  I also like that you can lend books to other Nook owners.  Second, I have already recooped the cost of my Nook in what I have saved on books.  I like to read classics, and now I can read them for free on my Nook.  Downloading them is very easy.  I also have found websites online for discounted books, some that are mainstream authors, some are not, but all are amusing to read.  The EPub format that the Nook uses is pretty common and it is easy to convert pdf's and other ebook types to EPUB using free programs like Calibre. Third, I liked the software that the Nook uses in comparison to the Kindle.  Although I have not done this myself, apparently you can illegally hack your Nook and get a chat program to work, or a facebook thing etc.  Again, I have not done it (and NO ONE should ever do that because it voids your warrenty and can destroy your device), but I like the idea that you can do more things with their OS.  To me it means that one day Barnes and Noble may make the device legally capable of doing more then just reading/downloading books, and I think that is great!  Finally, the selling point for me was going to a Barnes and Noble store and being able to hold a Nook and read a few pages and test it out.  It felt so good in my hands, and had a nice weight to it, with sharp text and a smooth modern case.Of course there are some strange things about the Nook, i.e. sometimes a book takes a little long to load etc.  However, the majority of your time is spent reading and turning pages, and I have had hardly any issues with that.  Battery life is all it needs to be, it lasts long enough that charging it is not a hassle.  I have not tried any audio books or music on it.  I have an Ipod for things like that, and honeslty do not understand how someone could read and listen to music at the same time.  Even after all these months, I have not once wanted my Nook to play music or read me a book, reading by itself has just been so great.  Since getting the Nook, I have somehow managed to read much more then I ever have before. Probably that is due to having a library at my fingertips, so I can read whatever I am in the mood for, it is easy to take everywhere, and it is quick to get a book.  As far as quality of a device goes, my friends with other ereaders of a lesser quality say that the Nook has very sharp and dark text in comparison to what they have (older ereaders or cheaper devices).  However, that is because of the quality of the device, not brand name.----Update---- 11/8/2010 -----I have had my Nook for several months now, and I am still in love with it.  I have about 200 books on it, most of them free from google or other websites.  I am reading more than I have ever read before in my life, and without leaving the trail of hundreds discarded paperbacks in my wake.  The Nook recently did a massive update and now it has games and can surf the internet.  I have not had any hardware issues with it, even loading tons of documents onto it all at once caused no freezing.  The battery life still lasts for several days (with wireless off).  I have no buyers remorse, even after the price dropped and even after they came out with the Nook color, I still feel like my purchase was worth every penny because I got to enjoy it for months before the price went down, and it is still a high quality item.  I highly recommend if you are deciding between the Nook and another device to try it before you buy it.  Go to a Barnes and Noble and try a Nook, AND go to a Target or a Best Buy (they have Kindles... but from what I have seen they are not powered on and usually are beat up) and try holding a Kindle.  Borrow one from a friend for a few hours and make sure the device fits you and what you need it for!",5.0,"Wasn't sure at first, but so glad I got it!!!",1278374400,"07 6, 2010",Electronics,1.0,,

I cannot believe with all the gamers I know that no one else has ever played this.  Way better than Monopoly, much quicker with layers of subtlety and depth that make this easy to learn and very hard to master.  My gaming group always seems to find the time to play a round of Aquire every time we get together.  The hardest part I have found is adjusting your strategy depending on the number of players as this will change how you approach your buying and takeovers.Components:  I have seen many complaints about the quality of the components of this version, and many of them are founded and some I think are exaggerated a bit.  The cheapest component are the tile holders, definately seen better there.  The tiles themselves are quite sturdy and although they do not lock down like previous editions I don't have that much of an issue with them moving all over the board.  The stock certificate cards are quite good, though a bit more color variety would be nice. The Worldwide, American, and Tower stocks are a little too close in color to each other.Overall I say this is a great game, certainly one of my new all time favorites.  While the component quality of this one is not the best, if you have never played this excellent game, the price on Amazon makes it a worthwhile purchase if you are taking a chance on an untried game.

My last one survived 5 yrs of hard use (scuba diving, surfing, mountains and deserts...) before giving up the ghost. And it cost about half of what the Suunto cost me. I thought I would try a different brand, but the Suunto survived less than a year of light/no use, no submersion or impacts.

The putting mat is all one piece; there is no gap or attaching of the putting surface.  You just unroll it.  It's not the BEST surface; mine has been unrolled for days, but is still &#34;bumpy&#34; from where it was unrolled.  But, it's all one piece.  The only things you need to do is attach the tree-backdrop (velcro is used here), add a sticker for the bottom of the &#34;hole&#34;, and stick in the flag.  I noticed the instructions were not applicable to the putting green I received; the instructions talked about putting the ball-return in place, etc, but really this is plug and play.  I did notice a problem with the flag; the hole that holds it goes down into the ball-return area, so I just don't use the flag.  The neat thing about this is that if you mis-hit a ball into the &#34;water&#34; or &#34;trap&#34;, it feeds the ball into the center area and shoots the ball back at you.  It's a powerful ball-return; it seems to depend on where the ball is located once the ball-return kicks in.  Sometimes the ball would roll back off the mat, sometimes it would make it halfway.It functions just fine.  Even with the &#34;bumps&#34; in the mat, I still made good putts.  It's more of a neat toy than a serious practice device:  the hole has an incline just before it, so you have to hit the ball harder than you would normally.  I had some solid shots get hung up on the incline at the end.  Your mis-hits have to be gentle; I had a few roll up onto the back of the green and roll back down, blocking the path of future hits.  Sometimes balls would get hung-up on the ball return area.  I would just hit a second ball, and the ball-return would shoot them back out.For the most part, I would recommend this toy.  It's nice to not have to walk back and forth for every shot just to get your ball.  The green surface isn't the thickest I've seen, but it's OK.  It's a fun distraction rather than a serious training device, and I think it would make a really good gift.",4.0,"Really good gift - more for fun than for ""practice"".",1401148800,"05 27, 2014",Sports_and_Outdoors,1.0,,

In the winter I like my coffee scalding but in warmer months I prefer it a bit less heated.Cleaning the machine - why is this an issue for people?  It literally takes seconds to rinse the parts off under the tap.  You don't want to use soap in a coffee maker ever.  We use a kitchen scrub brush to rinse all the grounds off under the tap and then DRY THOROUGHLY before putting it back together.  Not drying tends to cause the grounds to not transfer properly into the basket.Complaints:Honestly, 4 years wasn't enough time for me.  I feel it should have lasted longer and even then, for two of those years, we were limping along having to coax it into operation most mornings.

My 2 year old boy absolutely loves it so when he opened this up Christmas morning, he had it opened in no time and playing around with it. So that's the why with this purchase.As another review has mentioned, the magnets are thin, but I honestly don't know what they were expecting. It's no different than the magnet you get from a dentist with their number on it or anything similar. They are relatively strong, strong enough to hold the different scenes up on the fridge. Speaking of scenes, as in the description there are 4 of them. They are on the flip side of two pieces of paper stock with a highly glossed surface. They've got some stiffness to them, but still can be bent/creased, so beware if your little one has a knack for that.I've added 2 customer submitted photos. One just shows the scene card along with all the magnets and the second one shows some magnets ""set"" in a scene. One really cool thing about this is that the tin container is magnetic so it can be taken with you on the go for the kids to play along with whether it's in the car or at grandma and grandpa's house.Summary: For the price it's a good value. The magnets are of high quality, the scenes are really cool and the nice tin just adds to that value. This set has had a nice workout on our fridge for the last month or so. If you're on the fence, I'd definitely get a set.

Lead by one of the best frontmen rock has seen in years you'd think that was all this band had going for it, but no. You also have a band that even outshine Scott at times, and that is saying a lot about how great this band is. In my mind I think if they were still together making music they'd be the rulers of their genre, God knows they were in the '90s alongside Pearl Jam. As for this CD, I can't find a single song I don't like. From beginning to end this is one of the best releases in over a decade. It's got the radio anthems (Vasoline, Interstate Love Song, Big Empty), and you've got the songs that didn't get airtime yet are still just as good as the singles (Meatplow, Lounge Fly, Unglued). If anyone doubted STP could top Core, they were proven wrong with this release.Starting with Meatplow was a wise decision, it bridges the gap between releases very well. Meatplow moves through the verses and choruses with ease, there's no slow point to this song. Vasoline is the reason I ended up getting this CD. At first it didn't sound like STP but after repeated listens it just gets into your head and you're stuck singing it to yourself days after hearing it. Lounge Fly is a pretty consistent song that stays stalled in between hard and light music. While the music is pretty hard throughout, Scott just sings throughout the song. I have no complaints though, I think his voice is perfect any way he uses it. Interstate Love Song has got to be one of my top ten favorite songs of all time. I've heard it an uncountable amount of times yet it still sounds fresh, like the day I heard it for the first time. I can't help of thinking of a summer day when I hear it. Pretty Penny is one of the best rock ballads I've heard in recent memory. Although it grows a bit stale over repeated listens the lyrics still beg your attention. I'm hardpressed to think of a song so touching. While Big Empty is a bit flat through the verses the chorus simply soars, Scott's voice has yet to be better. The lyrics aren't extremely good but the mood and way they are presented makes for a great song. Kitchenware & Candybars is, I feel, the best way to end this CD. It's not as hard hitting as Core was so there's no need to end with a song like Where The River Goes. No, just a brooding song dripping with emotion like Kitchenware does is more than you could ask for. It's only fitting that this CD ends this way too. The not so hidden track is a comedic listen at best, although I do wish they would've just faded out with Kitchenware. But no big complaints about it, it just reminds you that this is a band who enjoys making music.All in all my favorite songs are Meatplow, Vasoline, Interstate Love Song, Big Empty, and Kitchenware & Candybars. I feel that whether you like commercial rock or underground rock, whatever kind of music you listen to, you will be able to see the beauty this CD contains. Hands down, this is one of the best CDs of the 90s, not to mention STPs best. If you have yet to hear this then you should feel ashamed letting a gem like this go unheard.",5.0,Fine place for a day full of breakdowns,1129248000,"10 14, 2005",Sports_and_Outdoors,1.0,,

So, when Amazon Vine had it on offer, I decided to give it a try.Here's what I have to say about it after a week's exposure to my wife (aged 40+) and my daughter (age 7).Generally speaking, Rosetta Stone does a great job in exposing kids to vocabulary.  Nouns are attributed to actual pictorial representations instead of the ""x = y"" approach.  This generally works well, as we do a better job with image recognition than we do with word matching.However, that being said, this kind of representation works well when you're in the early years of school where such learning applies.  As adults, however, we have already a well-established mind set where learning doesn't equate well to a kindergarten-level.  That's typically why we, as adults, sometimes have a hard time relating simple concepts to younger children simply because we tend to use constructs that are far more complex.In other words, while pictorial representations (i.e. ""immersion"") works well to introduce new and unfamiliar words to kids, this doesn't work well when it comes to grammar.  Sentence construction is best introduced in the traditional way of learning how to conjugate ""-er"" verbs in French by establishing simple rules (which account for 65% of the verbs in the French language).  Once those rules are learned, then it's quite easy to follow.Rosetta doesn't take this approach, which is why it hurts both kids and adults for altogether different reasons.  For kids, the immersion approach doesn't work simply because the rules need to be learned by memorization which is an adult concept.  Why do kids say things like, ""I fell down and it hurtED""...?  Because they take a simple rule, apply it, and they don't realize why it doesn't work; i.e., the ""immersion"" aspect doesn't prepare them for exceptions to rules, rather than the rules themselves.  For the same reason, adults learn better from learning verb conjugation through rules, not immersion; immersion doesn't cover how to conjugate verbs through conditional tense, past imperfect, etc. and French actually has a number of rules that are easier to follow through rote memorization instead of ""here you go...now speak!""That said, this is only Level 1.  However, I would say that it's a great vocabulary primer...I just wouldn't use it to teach grammar.Maybe it works well for others, which is why I give it the benefit of 3 stars.  Children may benefit from it more because of the general learning construct, but I would have to say that it fails to convey grammar effectively.  The company has been around for awhile.  But from someone who speaks both French and English and has actually seen the difference in learning between various ages, I am somewhat dubious about their claims.

The cute blue and grey toy soldiers with flags are visually appealing.  The moveable terrain pieces makes for attractive, simple maps.Those who want a more detailed simulation with historical Brigades and Regiments won't find that here.  Units are generic according to type and can be any size depending on the action fought.  This gives the game a lot of flexibility, and allows for the players to design myriads of their own battles. But the historical detail is lacking a bit. Still, the 30 scenarios included in the game are more than enough to get your teeth into.  Many focus on lesser known actions of the Civil War which is always nice to see.A fun re-make for those who played the original long ago.  A much different game now.  A great idea for the novice gamer and for those who have only played regular board games before.  You can probably get your girl friend to play this one!

After spending a considerable amount of time researching and reading about all of my options, I decided that the Nook Simple Touch with Glow Light is my best option.  I even went to Best Buy to physically compare them and speak with other users.  I spend time in Barnes & Noble stores (in Raleigh, NC and New York City) to get opinions from customer who already had the Nook to get their opinions.  As my purpose for getting this item was mainly for travel (I am embarking on a 1-2 year trip around the world), I thought given the weight, size and the glow light factor, this item would be perfect for reading on planes, hostel rooms, buses, etc.I first ordered the Nook Simple Touch through the website, as they were sold out in all the stores.  During that time, I wanted to buy a subscription for THE ECONOMIST. Barnes & Noble had a Father's Day Special (1yr for $99).  Before purchasing the time, I asked the staff if this subscription worked on the Nook Simple Touch....they assured me it did, as the requirement mentioned Nook Android systems and that's what the Simple Touch used.  Upon receiving my Nook, I called CS to ask about getting my starting my subscription.  Apparently the description for Android system only applied to the color tablets.  A simple misunderstanding.  No problem.After using the Nook Simple Touch for about a week, I noticed ""pinpoints"" when I used the glowlight.  I called CS about it and they said they didn't know what I was talking about but will send a replacement.  As I was leaving the country in 2 weeks, I was concerned about the the timing.  they assured me that it will arrive on time. This was on June 15.June 16, I went to visit a Barnes & Noble store and just inquired about my pinprick issue and a staff member said it was a well reported and known bug and BN would be happy to replace it.  I mentioned that the CS said they've never heard about and the BN store staff thought it was strange since the Nook Simple Glow Touch had two major issues and this was one of them.  Is CS lying to me or are they just unimformed?  I dind't worry, since I was getting a new one anyway.June 21, I stil l haven't received my replacement NOR any notice of shipping of the item.  I called the CS line and they said it's ""enroute"".  I ask ""does that mean it's on it's way? It's already left and in the middel of shipment?"".  they confirm and provide me with a tracking number.  I hang up and try the tracking number with UPS, USPS, FedEx, DHL...no record.  I try again the next day....stil no record.June 22, I call back to customer serivce and they confirm the tracking number and assure me again that I'll recieve my package before I leave the country.  I stay on the phone asking them to help me track it.  Spend some time on hold....the CS person gets back to me and says that it hasn't left the warehouse yet, but it will withink the next 24-48 hours and be assured that I'll get it in the next 7 days. I ask him if there's a note that I'm leaving the country. She confirms yes, it says that I need it before the end of June.  I ask if the itme leaves in 48 hours (june 24), how can I get it before June 30? (my departure date is July 1)?She says no problem it'll arrive within 7 days.  She just seems to be saying things wtihout really listening. I actually had to make her do the math....24+7=31.  so it would arrive on June 31...but ther is no such thing as June 31...so will I get it on time....then she says I might have an isssue.  By this time my frustration is over the top. I ask if I can FedEx it. She's not sure so she'll call me back with an answerJune 25, still didnt' hear anything back from them and during this time, I'm checking with BN stores in NYC to see if I can just replace it myself here.  But this item is on backorder.  And I need permissino from CS to do this and that can take time.June 26, I call BN CS for an update. Still hasn't left the warehouse.  I complain and the guy escalates me to Level 2.  I explain my situation and I get escalated to Level 3.  They seem to make it sound importnat that I'm up so high on the Levels, but really no one's doing anything.  I get to a Level 3 CS person. I'm on hold for another 20 minutes. During that time, I'm calling all the Barnes & Noble store in Manhattan to see if I can just replace it at the store. One store and one item left in stock, I ask teh store manager to hold it for me under my name and explain to him that I'm on the phone with CS. He agrees.  Level 3 manger gets back on the line and he doesn't know what to do. I tell him I found a store i can go to, to exchange it but he needs to call the up for approval.  No probem. He puts me on hold...I'm holding and then the Barnes & Noble store picks up.  Seems that the Level 3 manger didnt' know the difference between putting someone on hold and forwarding the call.  I explain the situation with a different manager at the same store. The two managers talk to each other and agree it's ok to come into exchange it.  At the store, things go smoothly, but I have to pay an extra $2.14 since I bought mine in Raleigh adn I'm in NYC and they have a higher tax.

So I cancel the replacement order.July 6, I""m in Beijing, China now.  I get an email from Barnes and Noble that they need information to cancel my replacement order or else I'll be charged (on my credit card) for an extra Nook.  I give them my serial number and say I've already cancellled this over a week ago and the CS says no problemJuly 7, BN write back (via email) that it's too late to cancel and I can just send the replacement item back. I write to them that I am no longer in the US and will not be able to ""return to sender""Am I wrong to be frustrated or upset?The item itself is great, but given the trouble and frustrations and the time I spend waiting with customer service, I think the Kindle is a better value.",2.0,"Great Product, Customer Support is horrible, maybe not worht the issues",1341532800,"07 6, 2012",Electronics,0.0,,

If you love to create cakes, and not just bake them, this will feed your appetite for cake baking and decorating, and you will place this alongside your other prized tomes of cake education. It's a wonderful journey of the wedding cake, aka ""a good thing"". If you purchased Martha's ""WEDDINGS"" book, this is the expanded and transformed chapter on cakes into this book.Martha has outdone herself once more in her passion to give us every possible idea, and instruction, to create the wedding cake of our dreams for the day of our dreams. And to join her in this quest is Wendy Kromer, master baker, who worked for Martha for many years, on both Martha's former TV show and for Martha Stewarts ""Weddings"" magazine; she now owns and operates her own bakery.While this book was made to help engaged couples decide on what type of cake they would like for their wedding, it also gives instructions should you wish to bake your own wedding cake. For those established bakers and caterers that are looking for ideas and concepts, this will be certainly be a well-referenced tool. The ""Album of Cakes"" section offers 111 official photographs of cakes, but if you add all photo's of cakes from other parts of this book, you will have well over 135 delectable wedding delights in which to choose.Martha and Wendy do not hold back on any instruction and it begins with the incredible photography of each cake, frosting, filling, and detail of these stunning cakes. These cakes come from both Martha's former TV show, Martha's ""Weddings"" magazines, as well as some new ones from collaboration with other cake artists.A hallmark of the Martha brand is that she is quite detailed in everything that she wishes to teach, and that is never more seen than here. There are some techniques that will require a professional to do such as the ""bubbles"" or ""pulled sugar ribbon"" for some of these cakes, and rightfully, she has not included those instructions in this book because they are labor and equipment intensive, as well as for safety reasons (you are working with intense heat with one, and need specific equipment for the other, let alone the need for specific training).If at all possible, try to obtain of copy of Martha's VHS tape called ""Cake Decorating"". It is the visual form of instruction on making some fabulous cakes, from simple 2-layer party cakes to actually assembling a 4-tier wedding cake. They were segments taken from her former TV show in which she, and guests, demonstrated this art of cake decorating. I am hoping that she will consider bringing that out again in DVD form. It is an excellent teaching tool and my copy has been well-worn out!This is a very big book, coffee table size, so along with excellent photography, the photos are large and show detail such as brush strokes of hand-painted fondant or delicate designs of rubber stamps used to imprint fondant. The use of gumpaste flowers and marzipan helps to complete certain dimensional and visual appearances desired.The journey begins:MARTHA AND WENDY'S INTRODUCTIONCHOOSING YOUR CAKE:Finding Inspiration: What style are you looking for? (modern, rustic, etc). What season? Location? Motif? (fabric, fruit, flowers, etc).A Cake's Components: Superb index with 14 cake flavors and 18 fillings and frostings along with recipes for each one.Icings and More: There are all types of ways to cover your cake and here are all of them, along with ""special considerations"" due to season, temperature, etc.Presenting the Cake: How do you want th cake to be displayed? Formal, relaxed? What type of bride and groom cake topper?

I was also drawn to the length of the cable and the price which was half of the cost of the adapter alone. My disappointment was when I went to plug in the HDMI connector to the back of the tv. As soon as I went to plug it in the housing fell apart on me! It was as if no kind of adhesive or clamping was done to the housing.

The one that I liked least was a Rolex Oyster as it is very heavy. The one that I liked most was a black sporty Tag Heuer as it was light and rugged.  But this one finally failed despite repeated attempts to repair it. So after 25 years, I decided to get my own watch.  It took me several months but when my search was over, I bought this Skagen watch.This Skagen watch is thin and very light.  I also like its sleek simple design.  It is able to withstand the rigors of daily use, and is usable even in the swimming pool.  The watch band is comfortable and does not catch on my fairly hairy arm.  It is also very easy to clean and is quite durable.  I have hit the watch accidentally several times on the table and on concrete walls but no scratches so far.There are 2 aspects of this watch that can be improved.  The first is that it needs some illuminated dials so that it would be readable at night.  One would need a light source to read the time at night.  I get around this difficulty by looking at the time in my mobile phone.  The second is that a ticking sound can be heard when placed near the bedside on a quite night.This watch is priced very reasonably, and I would have been willing to pay many times more for this watch.  I liked it so much that I decided to buy the recently released Skagen Men's Team CSC Titanium Watch # 723LTMLB.  This watch seems to resolve the 2 issues I mentioned above.

It fits a niche within a niche. A sendoff for Nokia fans of yesteryear. This is the last phone that runs the antiquated Symbian platform, which Nokia has already abandoned, and just using it will tell you why. It is slow, clunky, with ugly fonts and icons, almost impossible to use browser, unstable and crash prone, still uses a very archaic 360p resolution, canno scale to modern hardware, and is bogged down with the need for legacy support and poor apps. Even ignoring the software side, the phone itself is a clunker. The matte finish is not grippy and all randoom tapering on the sides and back make for little surface area to give a secure purchase on the phone. And it is a thick and heavy phone. 14mm at its thinnest, but over 18mm at the camera hump.

The power to create is a heady experience, though, and the effortlessness with which wonderful concoctions can be made using this machine ensures it will not become one of those useless appliances collecting dust on a shelf somewhere.This is a great purchase even for those who assume they can't eat ice cream!  Since you control the ingredients, you can create recipes working around any sort of diet -- allergy, diabetic, lactose intolerant, vegan, whatever!  The machine also works equally well for sherberts and frozen drinks.  It's extremely easy to use and cleans very easily.Few notes for better results:1) The bowl must be *frozen*. I recommend at least 2 days in the freezer between uses (you may want a second bowl).2) Upon removing the bowl from the freezer, add ingredients and use -- it will start to thaw immediately.  A friend noted that covering the top of the unit while mixing causes it to retain its &quot;cool&quot; longer (a plate over the opening works well).3) The ingredients must be very cold.  If cooking ingredients (such as for fruit or egg enhanced recipes), it's absolutely necessary to chill the resulting mixture before adding it to the unit.4) Choice in ingredients can make or break your ice cream.  While milk can be used, cream results in a much richer, thicker, tastier ice cream.  Also, make sure you've crushed or finely chopped any solid ingredients before adding, as otherwise, they will clog in the mechanism; they should also be added during the last 5 minutes only or will impede freezing (same goes for alcohol).  Thorough mixing of ingredients is important, as well, since the machine does not churn the mixture (sugar especially needs to be well dissolved or will result in uneven flavoring).5) Regardless of what you do, you will produce very soft ice cream.  Pouring the result into a freezer-proof container and freezing for a few hours to one day works very well.I know that sounds like a lot of hassles, but it's really not.The preparation of ingredients can range from moments to hours, as your options are quite limitless.It makes 1.5 quarts of ice cream, which is not a limitation (should you feel you will consistently need more servings, invest in additional bowls). It stores very well, lasting for a couple of weeks without crystalizing.  I would use mine every day if I could remember to buy cream!",5.0,My guilty pleasure...,1003017600,"10 14, 2001",Home_and_Kitchen,1.0,,

I would expect that once Fiona gets old enough to do it herself, it will be much easier for her to assemble on a hard surface.My one criticism is very superficial. The box is about twice as big as it needs to be. You may be wondering why that matters.... It is amazing how much stuff a tiny little baby accumulates.

Fee,"[0, 0]","Having had many Swiss Army Knives (Victorinox Multitools) in my scouting days I knew about Victorinox's quality. However, they became relegated to my knife drawer (it's a sickness, I know) because of more useful multitools (Leatherman, SOG, etc.). I've never been impressed by Gerber's fit/finish and mystery knife steel, have been impressed by SOG's toughness/compound pliers but never purchased, and became dissatisfied by Leatherman's fit/finish/QC. When saying I have owned/handled many brands of multitools, I mean it!As I work in an industrial environment as a maintenance mechanic, am married and father of two girls, and a general handyman, I use my tools all the time and take them very seriously.  While I use them heavily, I don't abuse them.I used to be a loyal Leatherman customer, having owned a Leatherman Kick, Core, Super Tool 300, a couple of Style CSs, and owned and/or given away more Micras than I can count.  Then I bought a Core because it was on clearance in a chain sporting goods retailer (they were clearing them out to make room for the Super Tool 300).  Within 1 month, I cracked the frame while bearing down on a bolt and broke the smallest screwdriver trying to back out a small screw (I used a cheap pocket screwdriver to ultimately back out the screw). My older Leatherman Kick has survived much more! I bought a Super Tool 300 to take its place while it was being serviced. The fit/finish was so poor that I returned it immediately.Now for the actual review. Amazon has some impressive prices on this multitool from time to time, and they are worth every penny. I liked mine so much, I bought two more as gifts for the excellent price offered at the time (51% off list price). I would have preferred the X, as it comes with scissors instead of the serrated blade, but it was $15 more. The Swisstool is definitely heavy duty, and does not ride comfortably in the pocket.  Good thing it comes with a good quality sheath.You really have to this tool in your hand to understand why everyone raves about the fit, finish, and ridiculous amount of engineering that went into this product. For instance, each 'secondary' tool is accessible from the outside when the pliers are closed, have their own dedicated spring (sized according to anticipated amount of use), and lock into place with a precision not seen in any other multitool.  It came lightly coated in a clear, odorless, rust-resistant oil (especially in the pivot points) which I deem unnecessary because of the tool's amazing rust resistance. I work in an environment where water and peroxide are everywhere, and this tool has not rusted one bit (another advantage over the Leatherman). I use most of the tools on a regular basis and love most of them!Now for the cons. A minor one is that the picture on Amazon doesn't accurately portray the product. Vicorinox stopped engraving the plier heads and putting the red sticker on the handle as a cost saving measure (Leatherman has too on their value multitools). The major disadvantage of the Swisstool is that it has blunt-nosed pliers. I do occasionally miss the needle-nose profile of my Leatherman. If you want a multitool with excellent quality, needle-nose pliers, and a smaller form factor, everyone seems to love the Swisstool Spirit series.In conclusion, if you find one of these on sale @Amazon, buy one! You won't regret it. A coworker of mine liked his so much that when his got stolen (he got it as a Christmas gift from his kids), he bought another one for $120!

I enjoy a simple workout that I do with Black Mountain Resistance Bands (tubes).  My workout consists of Overhead Press, Lateral Raises, Upright Rowing, Biceps Curls, Triceps Extensions, Standing Row, Chest Press and Calf Raises; then as golf season get closer I add Overhead Wood Chop (R&L;),  Standing Side Twist (R&L;) and Reverse Wood Chop (R&L;). These last three are very helpful in getting back into the rotation mode you will need for your golf swing, and if you are like me you need all the help you can get.The Black Mountain Resistance Bands (tubes) are color coded which makes it easy to select the right resistance for what you need.  The ones I have are Yellow 2-4lbs., Blue 4-6lbs., Green 10-12lbs., Black 15-20lbs. and Red 25-50lbs; and you can combine these to make other various resistances.  This package also includes a door anchor that is great for two reasons.  The first it allows to try quite a few more exercises by giving you a stable anchor at various heights on the door.  This anchor has the blocking necessary to prevent it from slipping through the door when shut, but it is small enough to slip through the crack in the door from the front.  This allows you to position it exactly where you want it quickly.All these various bands(tubes) and the combinations allow you to personalize your workout by switching or combining the tubes to give you the resistance that works for you.  It also allows my wife to use the same equipment (two for the price of one), which make it very cost efficient.  It takes almost no room for storage and we can take it any where we go on vacation.Great product, very pleased and I highly recommend it.D.

It's basically a combination of high fantasy and horror---think dwarves and elves battling werewolves and vampires, and you'll start to get the idea.It's worth noting what this game is not: it is not a role playing game by any stretch of the imagination (wordplay not intended, but I'll take credit for it). Aside from a few lines of flavor text you read at the beginning of each adventure, there isn't much of a sense of character and setting. You won't be going to town to buy equipment, you won't be bargaining with shopkeeps, and you won't be crafting an elaborate back story for your character. Castle Ravenloft is essentially a tile exploration game in which you move your miniature, draw a tile, place a monster figure on it, and roll a die to see if you get hit. Then, on your next turn, you'll attempt bloody revenge, rolling in an effort to make monster stew. Well, maybe not monster stew. Unless you like to eat kobolds. I mean, do what you like, I won't judge you. But eating kobolds, man? Seriously??Ahem, anyhoo, you'll progress through the stack of tiles, eventually reaching a goal tile. The goal tile is usually anywhere from 10-15 tiles deep, and most adventures --the game comes with a good number of different adventures to choose from -- most adventures will feature a ""boss"" you'll try to slay once you reach the goal. Along the way you'll draw lots of Encounter cards, which are generally pretty brutal (roll a die and add 8, if it hits you, take a couple damage. Oh and if it misses you, go ahead and take one damage).You'll also get treasure cards, which are rewards a Hero gets for killing a monster. These can be items that provide bonuses to die rolls; sometimes they're ""blessings"" which provide an immediate, one-time benefit.That's pretty much it. There are wrinkles here and there-- the different adventures in the provided booklet do a good job mixing up goals and tile layouts-- but overall, the game is somewhat repetitive. Don't expect a lot of tactical choices and depth from Castle Ravenloft.It's worth mentioning that this is a cooperative game. The players don't compete, but rather work together toward a common goal. This ensures that no one has to play the ""bad guys"", ie, control the monsters, there are simple instructions printed on each monster card that tell you what the monster does (""move next to the closest hero and attack"".)All this might make it sound like I don't like the game. On the contrary, I do quite like it. It plays in an hour, which is great. It really does provide a cool ""D&D; Lite"" experience. It looks great on the table. Who doesn't want to play with plastic monsters and heroes?? It also scales well with different numbers of players, being equally good played solo or with the full complement of five players.If you are looking for a quick-playing dungeon crawl, this is the one to get. Just realize what it isn't: it isn't a deep tactical exercise, and it isn't a role playing game.

It now seems like fraudulent advertising because I've since read that the MSRP is $79.99Initially I had serious problems with the Nook, and requested a refund. The seller, BlueProton, refused to take returns or give a refund for it, and directed me to Barnes & Noble who referred me back to the seller, stating  that the seller should refund it within 14 days; at that time  I'd only had it a few days. My Amazon A to Z claim ended with Amazon siding with the seller, BlueProton because their policy stated that they would not accept returns on Nooks - something I did not see when I initially read their policy!Because neither BlueProton nor Barnes & Noble would take responsibility for the defective product, and their attitude was ""Take the money and run!"", I'm giving the Nook a low review although later I found an update for the Nook which resolved the problems - with no help or information from either seller or Barnes & Noble!I now enjoy using the Nook which is so much easier and more comfortable to hold than regular books while reading,  and to carry back & forth to work each day or to travel with. I don't like the gray screen which requires you to face the Nook towards the light; and I don't like the glare on the screen from the sun or lights. I have to sit ""just so"" to read it - which somewhat defeats the idea of portability. Overall I do like it, but it needs improvement.My favorite use of the Nook is to borrow my local library's digital books using the free Overdrive Media Console software which allows you to select & save your library (ies) and to directly access the digital library from it on your PC, and then sideload (drag & drop)the borrowed books to your Nook; no more time wasted or trips through rush hour traffic to browse, borrow or return books downtown, and no more parking hassles! Most of my library's digital books are in ePub format which is the native format of the Nook. However, as other reviewers have stated, you can still borrow or buy Kindle or other formats of digital books and convert them to ePub via the free Calibre software. Borrowed library books can be returned automatically when the loan periods expire, or can be returned manually earlier if you decide not to finish the book during the loan period.Ordinarily I don't buy many fiction books because I rarely read any of them more than once. Additionally, due to the poor customer service from both Amazon (who owns Kindle) and Barnes & Noble (who owns Nook) I am determined to rarely buy any books from either of these companies, and will primarily download either their free books or the library's loan books. The companies want us to buy their ebooks, but won't take responsibility for their e-readers, so that infuriates me and alienates me for life.The pros: the low price; comfort; convenience; savings from being able to borrow library books instead of buying something you'll only read once; no clutter of physical books; easy loaning to friends with a guarantee that they will be returned in 14 days (automatic returns); ability to read multiple formats via conversion in free Calibre software. The Nook can also read your PDF files/documents from your PC or elsewhere, plus it can use your JPEG files of photos to use as your custom screensavers; the Nook will convert them to B&W.;The cons: PlueProton's and Barnes & Nobles's total lack of responsibility for their defective Nooks - why I gave the Nook such a low rating; Amazon's siding with Blue Proton's irresponsible returns policy; dreary gray screen which makes it difficult to read except in bright lighting; touch screen not as sensitive and responsive as it should be - often have to touch the screen a few times before getting a response.Over all I'm pleased with my Nook Simple Touch now that I managed to FIX IT BY MYSELF, but the companies' irresponsible policies have soured me towards them for life.",2.0,no responsibility from sellers for initially defective  new product,1361836800,"02 26, 2013",Electronics,0.0,,

This book was well recommended by a number of sources, so I got it with several other books. I am quite pleased with Colette Pitcher's presentation in this book.The other books tend to skim topics as if they're unimportant, and leap right into twelve-part petals. Colette takes it slow. She explains how transparent watercolors are see-through, while opaque (non-see-through) watercolors tend to have Chinese white in them. And then there are acrylics, which are also opaque, but these dry solidly. They won't re-wet. These kinds of details are important, quite helpful, and other similar books don't seem to cover them.She talks about how old watercolors had issues with fading in light, but that newer ones are much sturdier. That a key to watercolor's luminosity is that light shines through the transparent layers, bounces off the paper behind it, and reflects back at our eyes, giving it a glow. She talks not only about painting, but about spattering, using non-brush objects to make textures, and much more.She covers the emotions of painting. She says ""art tends to be stuffy, pretentious, and cerebral."" Instead, she pushes us to be relaxed and free. Practice every day, even for a few minutes. Buy inexpensive but good quality gear - don't let yourself quit out of frustration with cheap, inferior tools. Play with ""blooming"" paint and other ""errors"". Make your own color charts to know how your particular paints work. And, most of all, have patience. Let yourself rediscover a child-like awe of the world.She gives guidance on showing your artwork. Use white mats for art shows, and avoid cardboard / newsprint backings as the acid will damage the watercolor paper. Make sure the mat keeps the glass from touching the print, and look into glare free / UV blocking glass. She talks about drawing basics, for developing your starting sketches, and how to make a tic-tac-toe grid to place items of interest. She even provides a set of ""course assignments"" on things to work on, to develop your skills.There are only a few issues with the book. First, I found a few typos and layout issues that should have been caught and fixed. This isn't a self-published book; the Dummies publishing group is massive. Their editors should know by now how to proof a book. Next, the examples given for us to follow don't ramp up smoothly. First we're dabbing paint randomly on a page, and then we're constructing a full landscape. I'd like to see more steps in between about how to make trees, for example.Still, compared with the other options out there, this is a great guide with a wealth of information.

I hate having to go to the gym, and this product has made it easy to complete my strengthening at home.The first thing I noticed about this product, from the moment I held one of the bands in my hand, was the quality.  The bands are thick and smooth, and are secured to nylon straps which have carabiners for attachment to the hand grip.  I've used it for almost two weeks now and it's durable and easily stored.  It comes with a nylon tote bag, which makes it easy to hide or transport.  Inside the bag is a manual which tells you how to mix the bands for more resistance.  Put simply, the bands do exactly what they are supposed to.I wouldn't recommend this product for anything but rehab.  Real strength is gained by working and sweating in a gym, not with bands such as these.  That's not to diminish the quality of this product, but if you're seeking size and power, buy yourself a gym membership.My only complaint is that the carabiner does not attach easily to the door wedge piece.

My favorites come from the Ben & Jerry cook book. There are a lot of benefits from making your own ice cream. it's cheaper. It's rewarding. It's healthier too. Even if you make the most decadent ice creams, you're still using all natural ingredients with no preservatives.There are some tricks to this machine that greatly help performance.#1 Make sure the bowl is frozen. Leave it overnight. Shake it and if anything sloshes, it's not ready.#2 Chill all ingredients. Even if the ingredients just came from the fridge, put the batter back in. I test my batter to make sure it's 35-38 degrees before starting. This will make the freezing process more gradual, which means the ice crystals will be smaller. Small crystals mean a smoother texture.#3 I let the machine work until there's little or no movement in the ice cream. This depends on how much you've got in the machine, but my recipes make the ice cream expand up above the lip of the container. When ice cream forms over the paddle and doesn't get folded back in, that's when I turn it off.#4 Let it firm up in the freezer for 4-6 hours. IT WILL BE SOFT, maybe even runny, out of the machine. I try to avoid runny, so next time either let the machine run longer or your kitchen may be too warm. Why is runny bad?  Runny is liquid and you want to try and keep air in the ice cream, so the firmer it is going in, the better. Get it in the freezer fast. Also resist the urge to pack the ice cream down, with either a utensil or by dropping it on the counter. A smooth surface may look nice, but you want to keep air in the ice cream. The air is what makes it easy to scoop and gives it a good texture.#5 Put the bowl in a plastic bag while in freezer. This keep the frost out and improves taste. Make sure it's completely dry before going back in the freezer.#6 I'd also recommend going all out and using rich cream batters. These have the least water and will have the best texture. I'd prefer one scoop of really good ice cream to 4 of a crappy sorbet.#7 Add solid stuff near the end. Wait until the last 1/2 of freezing to add your berries, chips, etc. This will help to evenly distribute stuff throughout the mixture. I like to make strawberry, so I mash my berries, drizzle in the juice, then put the mush in during the last 1/2 of the cycle.#8 Store ice cream in an air tight container with plastic wrap pushed down to the surface. I use 1.5 quart Rubbermade  containers. They fit perfectly and allow the least amount of freezer air to touch the ice cream. Fat easily obsorbs oders and can make your ice cream taste funky. You could just keep it in the bowl, but I wouldn't do that unless you plan to eat it all later that day. Plus, the sooner you get the bowl clean and back in the freezer, the sooner you can make more ice cream!I've used a GE model that had two speeds. The slower speed seemed to freeze better. I also know of some machines that have a reverse function. I would be interested in checking these out if this one ever dies.Mine came with an extra bowl, which is nice to have one always frozen.In all, a great purchase and a pretty good price. Haven't bought ice cream from the store since.",4.0,make your own premium ice cream,1097539200,"10 12, 2004",Home_and_Kitchen,1.0,,

I had done a fair amount of research and decided on this one Thanksgiving weekend.  Happened to go to B&N; website and there they were..on sale for $79.00!!  This tablet is the best value out there IMO.I also purchased a AFN micro sd card to make this unit a full &#34;Android&#34; tablet.  I can dual boot from the start-up screen to either and have effectively doubled the memory!Videos look amazing!  I was a little disappointed at first (on the &#34;Nook&#34; side of the dual boot) with the audio as watching concert videos on YouTube, etc did not seem to go very loud, but the quality was quite good.  The earphone jack seemed a little loose at first and stereo did not seem to be working as it should to both earphones.  Come to find out, you have to really jam the plug in to the earphone jack pretty hard..I just didn't have them in all the way (this helped with the stereo issue above, but not the volume.  Also had issue with downloading from my Windows Media Player onto the Nook as some files would download and some would not.  Dual - booted to the &#34;Android&#34; (micro sd card) and WOW!!!  The volume, sound is absolutely AMAZING on YouTube, music files, etc....Everything.Still had issues downloading and playing all music files from Windows media player as .wma files simply would not download and play.  Ultimatley purchased &#34;PowerAmp&#34; music player for $3.99 ( you can get a free version for 2 week trial) and once again, WOW!!!wma files all play great from my Nook player, the sound quality is EXCELLENT.Reading is wonderful on this tablet as it should be.  Using the AFN card I have access to Amazon, Amazon mp3 store, Kindle books...anything and everything I could possibly need or want.  Have other stuff on the &#34;Nook&#34; side.No camera...no problem.  I'm a little perplexed by other reviewers who get their Nook HD and take away from their rating because of the lack of a camera.  Do a little research people!  I knew about 10 minutes in to researching this tablet that it had NO CAMERA!  Not B&N;'s fault you don't do your DD.For twice the price this would be a good buy.

I use them while watching TV, taking a break from my computer or bring the bands along when I am traveling which is often. I like these resistance bands better than my resistance loops too. With the handles, it does not hurt my hands like the loops. I also like this &#34;package&#34; where everything is organized. I think there are two downsides however. One, the set-up for connecting to a door is not viable for every home depending on how doors are put. I honestly do not have one spot in my house where I can use the set-up and not hit another wall or lamp or something. One needs to have space and I did not understand that beforehand. Next, using the guidebook, I was hoping there would be more leg exercises with the bands - all the examples are arms. Overall, I am pretty satisfied with the purchase. $30 is worth it!

Living in Los Angeles, it seemed silly to me NOT to have an ice cream machine, but I remember the mess of making it as a child with the ice and salt monstrosity we used to have. This machine, however, is fantastic. It took me about 10 minutes to throw all the ingredients in, push the button, and as soon as dinner was finished, so was the ice cream. Well, sort of. You definitely can't eat it immediately. I had to let the freezer bowl sit in the freezer for another 3 hours before it was a decent consistency, but the ice cream was delicious. My only complaint is that there's no lid for the freezer bowl and plastic wrap doesn't stick once it's cold. So my ice cream started to get freezer burn after a few days.

This is the same one as the 4qt. ice cream maker that uses rock salt and ice, just larger. (I know it's the same because the inlaws have the 4qt.  It was on sale at Wal-Mart and even cheaper than Amazon.I then exchanged the above ice cream maker, after issues I will get to, for the Rival Gel.You'll notice, however, I have the ""verified purchase stamp"" on my review of the Cuisinart 1.5 qt automatic ice cream maker. That's because I gave up with Rival after continued problems with my first two ice cream makers and ordered the Cuisinart from Amazon. It's a keeper. However, you may actually prefer one of the other ones I used more if your needs are different from my own so I'll break down my experiences and you can decide:But first...some TROUBLESHOOTING that may help you regardless of the ice cream maker you choose. Is your icecream more of a milkshake than ice cream? I have some chef tips:1.Never put in chunky ingredients from the beginning. They don't allow the butterfat to freeze correctly. They need to be added at the end (chocolate chips, fruit, etc.)Soy milk? No problem.2.Never use imitation vanilla extract. It contains propylene glycol which not only isn't as good as regular vanilla, it prevents milk and cream from freezing well. Use pure vanilla only.3.Your ingredients should be cold prior to adding them to the ice cream maker.4.If you have an electric ice cream maker it needs to be on and spinning prior to putting the ingredients in. If you add the ingredients first and then turn it on, the edges will freeze first to the bowl and your middle won't catch up. (Unfortunately you can't do this on the Rival 4 and 6 qt electric so it always wound up a little runny for me.)5.If you use an electric gel-bowl ice cream maker the bowl should be stored at the back of your freezer where it is coldest. If your freezer is full of other foods, it will actually be colder than if it is empty so an empty freezer may mean you need to freeze your gel-filled ice cream bowl longer.6.Cream has a higher butterfat content than milk so it begins to melt far faster and will take longer to freeze so you will see differences from soy milk, milk, non-fat milk etc.ICE CREAM CAPACITY:Rival Electric (RE) 4 or 6 qts, depending upon which model you choose.Rival Gel (RG) one quartCuisinart Automatic (CA) 1.5 qtsNOISE LEVEL:RE: loud; cannot hold a conversation in the same room it's inRG: loud; cannot hold a convesation in the same room it's inCA: surprisingly quiet...not silent but quite a purr compared to the other two.BUILD:RE: Cheaply made which wound up being our problem. The outside core is a very flimsy plastic. Thinner than my Tupperware. Not only did this not insulate the ice well which resulted in fast melting, it also wore down after a week of the motor popping out of the locked position and it's flexibility allowed pieces of ice to get lodged in the sides and make the motor stop. This is so common that it says in the owner's manual that when it does this you need to stop it and move the ice. This means you always need to be watching it during making. Happens on both size models which is why I had to exchange this originally for the gel model at Wal-mart. That flimsy plastic wore down after just one week from the motor popping off of the lock sockets.RG: Made better than the other model except the top leaves air in too close to ice cream which means it doesn't freeze as well and the fill hole is on an angle rather than top and is very small so ingredients spill easily.CA: I like the make, compact so no warm air is inside, sturdy, stores more easily with cord compartment, heavy-duty with no flimsiness or easily broken parts.CONCEPT:RE: Winds up costing more due to needing to buy rock salt and crushed ice each time. The manual states to use crushed ice only and this is because the top pops off easily and ice can get lodged between spinning bowl and the side. For some crazy reason, the paddle doesn't spin, the bowl does which means it makes the ice migrate and melt easily. Rock salt should not go down your sink so we would also walk it outside to the street. You don't want it in your yard either. Very messy with all the rock salt and ice being poured in while running in comparison to the other two models.RG: Freeze the gel bowl for about 24 hours and use no rock salt or ice.CA: Same as the RG.ISSUES:RE: Had lots of problems with having to fool with it during the process to make it work right, turns off automatically even if the icecream is runny when it senses the edges are done.RG: Motor overheats easily and when it does this it turns off automatically and won't allow you to start it again for another 20 minutes. An ice cream maker isn't needed to mix ingredients but to whip air into it so it doesn't freeze as an ice block but instead becomes fluffy. This means you ruin your mix and have to start over. They need a more powerful motor to avoid this rather than an auto shut off which ruins your batch.CA: Does not turn off automatically and has never overheated. If you need more freezing time, you can just keep on going.  I haven't yet had any problems with my Cuisinart but will report back if one comes up.TIME NEEDED TO WORK:RE: Usually 50 minRG:  Usually 35 to 38 minCA:  Usually 20 to 30 minThe time will vary per ingredients.  I based the above all on my plain vanilla recipe.All models come with a basic recipe book but they are so basic you'll probably want a good ice cream recipe book.  I love the Ben and Jerrys one because it's not just recipes, but goes into the science of making the perfect bowl too.  The Cuisinart has the nutritionals to every recipe, the Rival doesn't.  You probably don't want to see the calories of ice cream anyway. Especially chocolate!WARRANTY:RE 1 yearRG 1 yearCA  3 yearsICE CREAM CONSISTENCY:RE: I was very disappointed in the Rival Electric.  It runs until it senses the outside edges are done but this left my inside ice cream edges not whipped. It says to get it hard you should freeze it for 4 hours but the next day, since air wasn't whipped in, it left it a block of ice and I couldn't even scoop it. Because of this and then the plastic lock in wearing out is why I returned it for the Rival Gel.RG: I got a good batch but it was still softer than I wanted, however the next 2 times the motor got hot and, as per the owners manual, apparently this design flaw is common enough that it turns itself off when this happens and won't start again for another 20 min leaving me with 2 bad batches so I returned it.CA: If you like yours soft, 20 min seems to work well for that but I usually go all the way to 30 min to get the perfect consistency of whipped air into the icecream allowing it to be soft but still easily scooped days later.  Even on high butterfat ice cream recipes we had a perfect consistency so I fell in love with this one. That was the main thing for me, to get a good whipped up ice cream. Not an icy one even days later. This one is advertised as having a ""heavy duty motor"" which may mean the difference in it not overheating.CLEANING: Owners manual of all say to clean parts in warm soapy water, not the dishwasher.CONCLUSION: Although the Rival Electric holds more ice cream which is perfect if you are making it for a big crowd, I have had no negative results with the Cuisinart since I ordered it while the other makers were returned to the store...and I rarely return anything. However, it's also possible I just got unlucky so if you want a large capacity and have easier access than I do to crushed ice, it might be worth a try.For me, the Cusinart 1.5 qt is just the right size to keep the ice cream fresh for us before it's time to make another batch. For a large family, it may not work, but we nibble on it for a week then make another batch and that works great for us and since the consistency and motor where better than the Rival Gel for me this remains my pick.",5.0,First-hand comparison of 3 ice cream maker models,1276473600,"06 14, 2010",Home_and_Kitchen,1.0,,

The new Dungeons & Dragons board game ""Conquest of Nerath"" is a delight for gamers everywhere.  It plays like an interesting variation of Risk with a D&D; twist; while world domination isn't the only way to win the game, building armies and defeating opponents is the core of game play.  Two to four people can play, but due to the way the game is set up, having four players is definitely ideal; all four armies must be in play, so a two-person game requires each player to play two armies at once.  The quality of the game pieces is impressive, from the sturdy Event and Treasure cards to the glossy playing board to the relatively detailed individual army pieces, and experienced gamers will appreciate not having to separate those pieces from their original sprues.  The overall design and layout is reminiscent of  Fourth Edition D&D; player handbooks.

Although I have been hoping, but I have finally given up the hope that Apple will start selling a 13&#34; or a larger pad.I bought this Hannspree tablet mainly for its size. It is almost the same size as the regular music scores and the screen is big enough to let me read the notes of the scores. I was planning to use it only for this purpose. When I first started it, I noticed a few problems. As mentioned by the other user, the mail and the calendar can't connect to my Google account. This was really a surprise, since this is an Android pad. However, I am ok with this. I am not going to use this for reading email or viewing calendars, though it would be real nice if this works.I installed MobileSheet which is the app of my choice to manage my music scores. The app installed smoothly and runs ok. Another problem all a sudden showed up and made me quite upset. The screen went crazy zooming in and out and moving back and forth between several screens, like it was controlled by an invisible hand or fingers. I had to shut it down and reboot the device.The &#34;crazy screen&#34; problem has been showing up randomly. Once it occurs, I have to shut it down and reboot.

The bowl stays so cold and makes the ice cream so fast, I make a double batch. After the first batch is done in less than 15 minutes, I scoop it into paper pint containers. Then I pour the second batch of the cream mixture into the freezer bowl and start it up again. Afterwards, it stays so cold I have to wait until the next day for it to thaw so I can wash it. We keep it in the back of the freezer, and ours is set on a level 4 out of 7, so it's not like we have it unbelievably cold in there. So I'm pretty impressed with the freezer bowl and the amount of ice cream I can get out of just one use, which with one batch is 2.5 pints, and with a double batch five or so pints. Of course, these are all the same flavor, but still. The machine is rather loud, but since I have it on for 30 minutes tops, it's not that bad. Here is a fool-proof, no-cook recipe for one batch:  1.5 cups cream, 1.5 cups whole milk, .75 cup sugar, 1 tsp. real vanilla (omit for fruit recipes). Adding fruit pur&eacute;es will increase the volume of liquid, so you'll need to split it into two batches.Also, when the batch is done it is the consistency of soft-serve... You need to freeze it afterwards to get true hard ice cream. I don't know who these reviewers are that expect hard ice cream straight out of the bowl. With the recipe above, the ice cream gets hard in the freezer but is not hard to scoop... It stays creamy!",5.0,So cold I can make a double batch!,1338163200,"05 28, 2012",Home_and_Kitchen,1.0,,

Starting off, I been sifting through the many brands and kinds of kits with clips, cases and rings and any-mini-my-ne-mo'd this one. Now, I purchased this product from 3 different shippers. Planned one being a primary use, second as a back up and a third for a gift.One was from shipped from China (if time is a factor I'd suggest paying more for a local standard shipper). The other two were from the United States, one was standard mail and one was shipped quickly. It took 2 and a half weeks for the china to show, average time from its location. I've received items under a 2 week period from china with standard shipping before, but don't expect that miracle every time.  It takes a while for customs to clear packages through there ICS stations. So be patient.Standard USA shipper was only a day behind the quickly shipped package. I'd suggest Standard to save a few bucks, always enjoy a good deal for the right price. Why pay $5 more for something that you can get for $5 less tomorrow?UNPACKING. They all arrived in different packages(envelopes), each order arriving in two separate packages. For the 3 purchases, I received six packages. The Fish Eye lens always arrived by itself in its various shipping envelope package, inside having its own tiny zip lock plastic disposable package complete with the fish eye lens, a keychain and a couple 3M rings. The Wide Angle Lens + Macro arrived in its own shipped package complete with its tiny zip lock plastic disposable package containing the single set lens which is the Wide Angle Lens + Macro, a keychain and a couple 3M rings. The Macro lens is screwed into the Wide Angle Lens so you will need to separate the Wide Angle off the Macro to use just the Macro lens. Pretty standard shipping contents.INSTALLING. They installed pretty easy to the iPhone I own. Sadly I don't use my phone without it's case so you will need to remove the case. I had a smaller case laying around, much thinner than the one I currently used and tried attaching it. It worked, just. The more distance between the devices camera and the lens itself creates a narrower field scope with [any] attachable lens.Your eye sees roughly 170 degree, looking through a ring that is pressed against your face everything seen through that ring will be roughly your actual vision. Moving the same ring an inch from your face will lessen what you see inside that ring. Moving it further away reduces overall internal scope. Same effect applies with these attachable lens. In short, having the lens attached to your case, your increasing the distance lens from lens effecting the overall scope.I would suggesting using no case, or if you have the need for these...getting the back protectors that covers the back of your iPhone much like how screen protectors do.PERFORMANCE.  THE FISH EYE performed as expected. It's lens limitations visible on the edges in photo mode but not when dealing in video mode. The degree I'd guess is around 170 degrees and 155 degrees. Never actually tested this but it is sizably impressive for its lightweight compact design. I've seen the 220-degree fish eye lens for Nikon, that weighs over 11 lbs.  Google the 220 degree lens, and you might be impressed with the design of this fish eye lens.THE WIDE ANGLE is an underrated design of the fish eye. It requires the Macro attachment to operate properly, so you can't separate the two ie gift the Wide Angle to a friend and the Macro to another friend. Only the Macro operates by itself, the Wide Angle requires the Macro to function. The angle which the Fish Eye scopes, the Wide Angle does just slightly less then that. The Wide Angle is for having more in view, limiting the spherical distortion of the Fish Eye. Impressive is you don't want the Fish Eye distortion, but personally I prefer the Fish Eye because you get a little bit more field of vision than the Wide Angle. Using the Wide Angle vs the Fish Eye during fast moving(running) you will get a bit more shock/vibration shakiness. I wouldn't suggest the Wide Angle when doing high shock movements.THE MACRO is truly remarkable for it's size. Not as amazing actual high end cameras, but still remarkable. This is my first test of the MACRO lens overall, having dealt with various of FILM cameras in my time I never had a MACRO lens attachment of any of my previous cameras. This Macro will make everything blurry as does all macro lens attachments. This is supposed to happen. But get in close to your object, within inches and the details will burst out in a crazy sense of amazement. I captured my girlfriends eye pupil to where the lens was actually making contact with her eye lashes. The detail the eye has you never see with your naked eye, is kinda creepy. I used to thing she had very pretty eyes. Now, they look....well the Macro worked perfectly. Maybe to perfect lol.THE 3M RINGS: The stupid little 3M rings you place on your phone are a joke. I personally loved the lens, but the rings never actually STICK to the phone for a carefree installation. I've cleaned the surfaces, alcohol swabbed and still the adhesive comes off. At times the 3M ring fell off when the lens was on my iPhone taking the whole lens with it to the floor. I'd suggest if this happens to you, apply E6000 Glue via toothpick, just a dab. Allow the ring to set for a couple hours. Then from there you can leave the ring on without an issue. If you want to remove it, pry it off safely. The residue clears right up with nail polish remover and you never even noticed you had a ring on there.OVERALL: I am happy with the purchase. I waited what seems like forever for the china package. Once I got that I ordered two more sets. Absolutely a must have for any budgeted photograph enthusiast with an iPhone. There are more advanced types of lens sets but this one is truly amazing with its impressively low cost design. Apart for the 3M rings, I still give this 5 stars. (Rating 4.6)Doesn't work with iPod's (without considerable customization) due to their camera closer to the edge and tapering into a curve which doesn't allow the stupid 3M ring to stick.",4.0,"iRave Review, sorta...",1393027200,"02 22, 2014",Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,,"{'CS': 0.73527249, 'MNR': 0.666666667, 'RB': 2.0, 'RC': 6.0, 'PR': 66.66666667, 'NR': 33.33333333, 'FR': 0.333333333, 'RSP': 0.0, 'AW': 151.0, 'RD': 0.827586207, 'RL': 6214.0, 'ER': 0.0, 'PC': 3.719172633}",0.0

However, the basic problem with this game is the initial conception - that WWII can be isolated to just the European theater. The mere concept demonstrates the game's limitations. What if the British are pressured in India? What if the Japanese increase garrisons in Manchuria? Even if the Japanese would get stomped by trying once again for Siberia (as they were encircled and crushed in the late 30's), it would still force the Russians to choose between two very difficult problems, and possibly increase garrisons at the expense of the German front, since defending Siberia is a very economical form of defense. What about the war in the Pacific? Are America's resources being funneled into that theater in the proper force levels? All of these would help the Germans in different ways. Instead, we're asked to turn a blind eye to these issues, and pretend that nothing else affects the European theater.Although this game adds some very interesting rules that were clearly needed in the original game, the problem with this edition is that it is incredibly limited at the stategic level. Without the Japanese, and the theoretical possiblity (although, in reality, impossibility) of squeezing the British economically with both Axis players, the game offers fewer choices, much like the actual conditions presented to the Germans in WWII. The Germans can do two things: build a big navy, and hope to conquer Britain, or build a big army and hope to conquer Soviet Russia. Hybrid strategies are doomed to failure, unless you're playing your little brother or geriatric grandmother. You might say, &quot;that's the way it was&quot; but only if you concentrate on the Germans. That's why they call it World War II - because it was worldwide.Even though the destroyers and fighter interception rules add some much-needed realism at a more tactical level, it actually is less realistic strategically. In many ways, the original is fun not so much because it's a &quot;realistic&quot; representation of WWII (which it most clearly is not, except in very minor ways) but because of all the strategic options available, and when you consider all of them, it's like a modernized (albeit simpler) version of Chess. In this edition, you buy either tanks or ships as the Germans, and everything is totally predictable. My sincere hope is that the Pacific edition will be more versatile, and require more thinking for veteran players. If you're an average or below-average player, you might enjoy this game for awhile longer.

When I saw this product, I was excited.  To have a notebook with my Kindle made it easy for me to just toss one thing in my bag and head out without having to look for separate things.  When I ordered it, I knew it was going to be bulky, but didn't think it would be quite this bulky...but it works.  When I opened the box, I was very happy with the look of the product - love the leather - and was excited to use this.  So, why only 3 stars?  Now that I have been using it for a while, there are a couple issues:1.  It is heavier than I thought it would be and I find myself keeping my Kindle out, separate, unless I am taking it someplace.  It was just too heavy to hold and sit on the couch reading.2.  The spine of this product is not well made.  Mine makes crackling noises, like there is a light plastic or something in there.  I thought it would stop after it broke in, but it is still doing it and it is loud.3.  There really needs to be a slot or something on the spine to put a pen.  There is no way to attach a pen - which kinda defeats the purpose of the pairing with a notebook.4.  The spine feels flimsy and when you close the covers, the front cover sags a little and does not line up with the back.  The only way to keep it together is to use the back strap to close the binder.  I expected it to be a little more sturdy than this.5.  Amazon does not sell the refills for it.  Seriously? they don't carry the 5.25x8.25 soft cover reporter notebooks?  I would love to have one with lines, instead of the plain ones - but none of them are available here.  You can get them at Borders if you need to, or on [...] - but if you are going to have a product like this, you should sell the refills.6.  It would have been nice if they had made these so you can switch the location of the Kindle and the pad.  For a right handed person, you have to slide the notebook back and forth to alternate between reading and writing...it is a pain if you are doing any kind of research.  I end up taking the notebook out and having it on the table, if I am at a table, but I could just bring a notebook with me and loose some of the bulk.  Forget trying to use it as a laptop desk.  I end up hitting buttons and changing pages trying to reach across to take notes.",3.0,Not quite what I was expecting.,1279929600,"07 24, 2010",Electronics,0.0,,

I've been carrying this knife with me just about wherever I go for the past four years or so - it is fantastic. It's not great at any specific things, and can never substitute for a good toolbox or specialty tools, but it can do a lot of different things, and it saves so much time to just have this with me for the quick, light-duty tasks that I encounter. While I was an undergraduate student, this tool plus a hammer served as most of my on-the-cheap dorm room toolkit, and served quite effectively.Compared to other multitools I've seen, I'm particularly pleased with how sturdy this knife feels and has proven to be, how every single blade is accessible with the pliers closed, and how securely /all/ of the blades lock. Also, while this is now a fairly common feature among multitools, this knife was one of the first to think of actually rounding the edges of the metal on the side that you grip for the pliers, so that you don't kill your hands if you're holding something tightly.The lock for the blades is a slide that springs into place whenever you open any of the blades. Most multitools only have a couple of the blades lock, which seems silly to me - I'm providing more downward pressure when using the dull-edged screwdriver blades, so while I'm not going to cut off a finger with philips head, it's still at least as valuable to have that lock as the main blade. To close the blades, you have to pull and hold the spring lock back. I've never had the lock disengage on its own (and I've treated it quite harshly).Unlike some Leathermans and Gerbers, there are no screws that you can tighten should anything become loose. However, I have never had that problem with this tool. It still feels just as tightly riveted as it did when I first got it.The only actual negative I have for this knife is that, while the edges one holds for the pliers are rounded, they're also smooth steel - which means that a sweaty or greasy hand will start to slip the tighter you grip. It's not practical to create finger holds or similar on a compact tool such as this, but Victorinox could very easily just roughen that rounded edge a bit, instead of letting them be perfectly smooth.Also one point of maintenance: every few months, I need to add a little light lubricating oil to the joints for each of the two sets of blades, otherwise they start to stick (such that pulling out one blade may start to also pull out the blade next to it). But again, that's just taking care of your knife.",5.0,Fantastic multitool - I carry it wherever I go,1272585600,"04 30, 2010",Sports_and_Outdoors,1.0,,

Another, in my opinion, tremendous shortcoming is the fact that this cover seems to be designed exclusively for the left-handed use. The notepad holder is non-reversible, forcing it to be on the left side of your Kindle, so you end up hitting it with your elbow while writing.

The book does not provide pictures of whimsical cakes - there are other books on the market for that.While I did not buy the book for cake recipes (so I can't judge the quality and flavor of the ones provided), I did buy the book to complement a wedding cake decorating class that I am taking.  If you are a baker who is very interested in cake decorating, or need instruction on how to prepare large, multi-layered cakes, ""Wedding Cakes"" is very helpful.  If you are willing to put the considerable amount of time needed to perfect these techniques, (and believe me, it takes a lot of practice), this book is a wonderful resource.  You will, however, have to be patient; your cakes will not look like Martha's the first dozen times you try!",4.0,A Decorating Resource,1200787200,"01 20, 2008",Home_and_Kitchen,1.0,,

It allowed my daughter to express herself and create her own story and drawings. Her book title was named, ""All About Cats"". She was THRILLED when it arrived in the mail and to tell others that she has a ""published"" book. (wink wink) Most importantly, she continues to read thru her book 6 months later and is extremely proud of her achievement as an author and illustrator. It is definitely an added boost to your child's self-confidence.Overall the quality, ease of use, and product is outstanding.  They provide you with ample pages (we only used half of the pages provided to us) for your child to create their story on.  At the top of the page, there is an area for drawings and then below that, an area to write a sentence or two. My personal preference was to have my child use her own handwriting to draw her pictures and write her story. However, illuStory provides additional choices of using electronic images and typed written words.  So you have many options to choose from as you explore your creativity.  When your done creating all the pages, just use the enclosed envelope and mail them in.  In just a few weeks, you will receive your personalized hardcover book.This year, I am having my daughter create one page at a time.  That way, we can capture the entire year thru my daughters eyes as we have vacations, celebrate holidays, go to the beach, etc.  I also plan on having her school and sports teachers complete their own page, along with Grandma and myself and have that added into the book as a surprise for her. I can't wait, this will be the best Keepsake EVER!!From one Mom to another, this is a great item for children.

Although it's a bit weird to be writing a review of it on Amazon, I felt that potential Kindle purchasers should understand their options.The Nook Color is, by far, the best eReader I've used (including the iPad). It's not perfect, but it almost is. The LCD screen is very easy to read, which surprised me since I was a big fan of e-ink and did not like long-term reading on the iPad. The lack of need for a night light is great, and the software it ships with is lightning fast and almost bug-free. Really, there is no lag when I'm using it and the functionality (once you spend 3 minutes learning it) is near-perfect.BN is quickly catching up to Amazon on content...frankly don't notice a difference anymore. Plus, you can side-load eBooks from Google and elsewhere.I know this...I will never go back to e-ink again and love this screen.I also LOVE the delivery of magazines on this thing. Really, it's better than the real magazine. You get full color reproduction of text and pics, and it gives you an Article View if you just want to read the article. It is a great way to get magazines and will be better as they get more publishers (right now, it's a decent list but it could be better).I also really like the multimedia support...I can load photos and pics on an Micro SD card and take my music with me. If I'm in a wifi area, I get full Pandora support! I wish it had 3G, but this is still great.Having said that, the Color is not perfect. First off, the weight, while acceptable, is SLIGHTLY too much. It won't cause strain like the iPad and is perfectly capable of being read in bed (you can lock out the gyro so the book doesn't flip Portrait=>Landscape), but it's not the unnoticeable weight of the Nook or Kindle (or paperback). Still way better than a hardcover though.Second, the screen, while great, is slightly tactile, not glass like you would be used to on an iPhone or high-end Android phone...this is nitpicky, but I noticed it.Third, no Flash support yet (and, while it is a great web-browser, it's not a laptop, iPad, or even like my HTC Evo). This, and the lack of pinch-zoom multi-touch, affects my enjoyment of the web brower (note: you can zoom, just not pinch-zoom). UPDATE: Pinch Zoom is here! It's very good, but not great, implementation. Makes the browser that much better!Fourth, the newspaper delivery, while acceptable and similar to the original Nook/Kindle, is not good enough. Frankly, it's easier to read the web pages of the papers than on this and pales in comparison to the magazine delivery, which really is SUPERB!Finally, and most importantly, is the battery. This is not like an e0ink reader. To give you an idea, the other day, I started out with a full charge and I read around 600 pages of a book and did some light browsing. I did not use music or Pandora and did not pay any games. At the end of the day, I had to charge it again. This was about 7 or 8 hours of use. That's OK with me but it ain't the type of thing that you can go on a three day road trip without your chord like the Kindle or original Nook.Anyway, it looks like my cons are longer than the pros, but really, this is a great product. I can't wait to see Amazon's response and appreciate the (hopefully) friendly competition that this represents!",5.0,Wow - what an eReader is meant to be!,1293667200,"12 30, 2010",Electronics,1.0,,

(I also put some towels over the top to hold in the cold) After 15 minutes I poured in the mini chocolate chips, and set the timer for another 15 minutes.After the time was up, I put the (pretty creamy soft serve type) ice cream into a plastic bowl, covered with plastic wrap and the lid, and put it in the freezer.Then I washed the mixing bowl with cool water.

This is all despite having an international credit card accepted all over the United States (even by Barnes & Noble themselves as this is the same card that I used to pay for my B&N; membership) and despite even giving them my US postal and physical address where all of my packages would be signed for  by a real person.The thing that angers me the most is that I explained to Barnes & Noble (via phone) that I live in Trinidad and they said that it would not be a problem for me to purchase books, but after purchasing a Nook color plus additional items such as screen protectors, a leather case and a 32 gig Sandisk memory card (all bought on Amazon), I have not been able to purchase a single book.If International Customers are not welcome, there should at least be some type of warning on their website. I feel like I was ripped-off by Barnes & Noble, and the sad thing about it is that I bought it all as a birthday gift for my wife. Shame on Barnes & Noble, that sales rep lied to me just to make a sale, my money was good enough for them but I am not good enough for their product. Now I have this New Nook color with all of these extras just gathering dust.It is sad to see just how low some companies will stoop to make a dollar.The real slap in the face is that after registering the nook on the Barnes & Noble website for the purpose of purchasing books, they have no problem sending me offers week after week to purchase even more of their products but as far as I am concerned, they have lost this customer permanently.P.S. This review has nothing whatsoever to do with Amazon.com, my gripe is with Barnes & Noble for giving false information to secure a sale and caring nothing about International Customers.(UPDATE  UPDATE  UPDATE)In the interest of fairness to Barnes & Noble and giving you Amazon.com community 100% reliable information I decided to open an account with a bank that's based in the USA to see if B&N; would be able to access the funds from that account, I'm trying to find out whether it's a location issue or just a payment issue so we can all know for sure.I decided to try this little experiment because I just can't understand how I can gain access to sample books from B&N; but every time I try to purchase one there seems to be a problem, what makes this whole thing even more confusing is the e-mail that was sent by B&N; after I tried to purchase a Book via my Scotia Master Card (books can only be sold to customers ""physically"" residing in the United States).I now have a Bank Of America Visa Debit Card which I have not tried as yet, it is possible that the issue with Barnes & Noble is that they cannot access funds from my Scotia Master Card which is based in Trinidad so I will give the Bank Of America card a try seeing that it's based in the USA and if that does not work then the last resort will be to try using my Pay Pal account. I'll post an update as to whether it worked or not.(UPDATE  UPDATE  UPDATE)I'm sorry for taking so long but anyway, let us get on with it.  As I said before, every time I tried to purchase a book there seems to be a problem, what makes this whole thing even more confusing is the e-mail that was sent by B&N; after I tried to purchase a Book via my Scotia Master Card (books can only be sold to customers ""physically"" residing in the United States).Well I found out that IT IS POSSIBLE to purchase books on the Nook once you are using a US based card. I was not able to purchase books using my Scotia Master Card but I had no problem whatsoever when using my Bank of America Visa Card, so it definitely has nothing to do with our geographical location, or IP address. The only issue that I see here is the fact that not everyone has access to a US Bank Card but you may still have a chance with making purchases via PayPal.I have noticed that there are some US based sellers that have problems accessing funds from Trinidad based Credit Cards, some even have problems accessing funds from US based Cards although they are also in the US themselves, in cases like this I've found that the best payment method to avoid any headaches is via PayPal. I've never had any issue when paying via PayPal, even when other forms of payment could not work.I hope that this helps a little.",1.0,INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMERS BEWARE,1332374400,"03 22, 2012",Electronics,0.0,,

The abilities are more fun, the playable heroes finally branch out somewhat from the tired old standard classes, there are eight playable heroes instead of five, and the new team challenge adventures and betrayal adventures are great additions to the rules. I also like that the rock walls look jagged and organic: the straight-line sameness of the dungeons in the previous two games made the environments dreary and boring.My only complaint is that there are too few challenging monsters: these heroes and items are a lot more powerful - frequently granting the ability to reliably deal 2 damage per turn - and the 1-hp goblin monsters never stay on the board longer than 1 turn. Owners of Castle Ravenloft and Wrath of Ashardalon can remedy this by adding more challenging monster cards and figurines from those games - the Cave Bear and the Gargoyle come to mind.I do think that ""Legend of Drizzt"" is an inappropriate name. Having played a half-dozen adventures in this game I can confidently say that Bruenor Battlehammer is the star of this show, and that nothing, nothing at all in any of the D&D; Adventure System board games, can compare to the moment when he deals the killing blow to a dragon or a balor with his ""headbutt"" ability. Especially if he himself is at 1 HP at the time of use.Because of this, my friends and I have affectionately renamed the King of Mithral Hall ""Headbutts McGee,"" and we have dubbed this game ""The Ballad of Headbutts McGee""Dude will headbutt anything.

I found this glass popper and gave it a try. I love it!!! It has a silicone lid with ventilation, and is a nice, small, one-person size. I use it almost every night to make a single 4-cup portion of popcorn for myself. If hubby wants some (and he seldom does) I just pop another batch for him. The perfect ""recipe"" for this popper (and my GE Profile over-the-stove type microwave as well) is this:  3 Tbsp Popcorn Kernels, Microwave on High for 2 min. 15 sec. (2:15)... if popping stops before that, stop the microwave.  This makes a 4-cup serving of low-calorie popcorn (only 60 calories!).  Now, if you want to add butter, oil, calories, etc., that's up to you. But I would not use the lid to melt anything on, because the corn won't all pop right. So I sometimes just melt some coconut oil on the side, mix it in good, and then sprinkle salt or Flavacol over it... Yum!The only thing I do not like is that some popcorn usually sticks to the inside of the glass, near the bottom. I am not sure why, maybe it's the Orville Reddenbacher kernels I am using. I will try switching to another brand and update my review here if that makes a difference. But I usually have to end up sticking my hand inside to scrape out the last of the popcorn that is stuck to the glass.  I also wish the glass part was a bit larger, because the 4 cups popped reaches almost to the top, and since the top is sort of like a bottleneck, it's a bit hard to shake the popcorn out at first since it's pretty packed in there.

She had played through a 'newbie' campaign with us (using dumbed-down rules) and had gotten a decent grasp of the game, but she was still struggling and didn't have any materials of her own.First of all, let me say that I am glad to see the return of the paperback PHB. It's necessary and I hope they start marketing it separately. The dice that come with it aren't exactly special, but they don't suck either and the fact that it comes with 4d6 is a nice bonus (I wish they would've included a 2nd d20, though).I personally haven't checked out the supplementary materials, but I can honestly say that since the purchase I've seen a marked improvement in her play.I don't recommend a player buying this for themselves.

As I do with every new electronic device I own, I wanted to update the software to the most current version. This resulted in me having to call the Technical Support number yet again and going through another round of script-reading and hold-waiting to them NOT being able to fix the issue. In the end, I just returned the Nook Color for a full refund.As cool as this device is for reading color files, this kind of headache for just trying to do minor things with it (registering it and updating software) are NOT worth it.

I wanted an MP3 player that would hold a lot of music so I wouldn't have to keep running to my computer to transfer in new music every time I wanted to listen to something different. This unit does do that, but you pay a price for it. (1) The unit is awkwardly shaped, heavy, and rather bulky. I thought I could get used to this by telling myself that the unit would be like holding a portable CD player. Wrong! It weighs nearly a pound! What's worse is that this units shape makes it feel a little awkward to try to carry it in your hand. I always feel like I'm going to drop it because of it's weird, hard to grip oval shape covered with a slippery plastic case. I just don't enjoy walking around with this large heavy thing in my hand. (2) The battery life is one of its biggest drawbacks. You only get 3-4 hours of usage from a single charge! Talk about stressful! When I'm away from home I'm constantly worried it's going to die after running out of juice again and it leaves me searching for a place to charge it wherever I go. Making sure you always have extra charged batteries with you at all times just adds to the stress! I can't tell you how many times this thing has gone dead on me when I've been out and about. Listening to a portable music player should be fun and a relatively carefree process, and this thing just does not give me that kind of an experience. (3) It takes forever for this player to boot up and load the music! You have to sit and wait a couple minutes during this process before you can start doing anything with it! This is a real drawback if you are the type of person who would be turning it on and off through out the day to listen to a few tunes when you have a little bit of time on the go, like on your lunch break, in between classes or meetings, out doing quick errands, or using it in your car for numerous but short trip where you would have to shut it off upon arrival. This problem simply makes me not want to use this unit when I normally would with a standard MP3 player. I end up just leaving it my bag most the time if I know I'm not going to have a lot of time to listen to it, and with the size and weight issue I don't really enjoy hauling it around in my bag either since I already have enough to carry as it is. ***Basically, this unit was designed to be a stand alone MP3 player plugged into a wall with speakers plugged into it, NOT as a portable &quot;on the go&quot; music player -the unit is just too much of a hassle for it to be truly portable.",3.0,"Unit is too bulky, battery life sucks, &amp; OS too slow !!!",981504000,"02 7, 2001",Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,0.0,,

I love their products, and when I saw this book light, I thought, ""Hey, I could use a beautiful book light."" I checked the reviews and the many negative comments made me slightly apprehensive, but I figured they were just a handful of negative experiences or competitors trying to discourage me - there was no way that a company that has built itself on the quality of their product would produce something that didn't work correctly...I made the 35 minute trek to the only office supply store that had them in stock, purchased it, went out to my car, opened it, **click** turned it on... **click** **CRUNCH**... **click click**... and that was it. Just like the other reviews, it wouldn't turn off. Crestfallen, I walked back into the store, hoping to exchange it. When I walked up to the cashier, she was not surprised and said that this was the third time she'd had someone come right back in and exchange the light. She gave me another one which I proceeded to open and it worked, but by the time I got home, it was stuck in the on position again. I am going to take it back next week and get my money back.I urge you not to purchase this light. It is poorly made, and if, like me, you were expecting the quality of a Moleskine product in this book light - I am telling you it's just not there. Defects aside, the light does not feel good in your hand. The best products make you want to use them. When I buy a new Moleskine journal, I want to write, even if I have nothing to say. I expected in buying this book light that I'd want to read at night, even if I didn't have anything to read! Perhaps I'm asking for too much from a $20 book light, but it's what Moleskine themselves have taught me to expect from them. I was extremely let down and am hoping they'll take this one back to the drawing board.

The ""review"" farther down changed my opinion. Comparing STP to the Monkees has to be the stupidest comparison I have read yet in a review. STP are musicians in the truest sense. Their performing and songwriting chops are (or were) greater than the vast majority of thier 1990s cohorts. Just listening to them for more than 10 seconds makes that plainly clear. The lower review comes from musical uneducatedness more than anything else.First, we must get out of the way while STP is lumped in the ""grunge"" movement they were not a true band of that genre. The DeLeo Brothers have more at heart and in common with 70s hard rock than Kurt Cobain's shameless ripoff of The Pixies. The first album CORE causes confusion because it sure sounds like grunge. I view that album as a switch and bait. It was very much the ""big"" sound at the time. It got STP on the radar to where they could loosen up and throw off the shackles the musically limiting grunge genre. For this the trendy grunge fans bag on STP fiercly for daring to grow beyond grunge. Posuers might be a word they'd use. I'm ok with them doing that, because STP moved beyond grunge for the right reasons. Its a term thrown out because of envy. I like the spirit and integrity of making your own road.Purple is a very ambitious and deep record. It captures a band at thier creative zenith. There is also something here that I've not noticed in many years from a band - emotion. Not cliched anger, or fury so prevalent in today's ""alternative"" corporate crap.  I'm speaking more of sublety, sure there is some in-your-face-ness, but there is also love and even sadness. Which in rock is very difficult to pull off. Anger is easy, but having a wide array of emotion in a release - especially in the 1990s was rare.Classics abound from Interstate Love Song to Vasoline. My personal favorite though is Kitchenware and Candybars - what a deep emotional cut!The flow of the album is brillant. As is the song selections. There isn't any filler at all here. Which is a rarity.If you've only heard CORE, Scott Weiland changes his approach for the better. Weiland loses the overused forced baritone and sings much more naturally with wonderful results.I could continue to sing the praises of this record. However, you get the point. Many other reviewers agree with me. The ones that don't fit into the aformentioned Grunge crowd who hurl predictable invectives at STP.If you don't own this record you are missing one of the higher points of 1990s rock. In an era where the diversity, depth and willingness to take you places was all but gone. STP stepped up and delivered an album that 20 years from now will still be considered essentual.",5.0,STP the Monkees? Puhleeez.

Very B & N friendly.  Very good battery charge life.Con:  Lousy quick setup guide (more like an advertisement), Only responds to finger touch (I prefer a screen that accepts stylus touch.  I have large hands and fingers).  Lousy speakers (but I expected that)  I Haven't been able to download movies from Netflix, I'll keep working on that.  Connection to Netflix was the main reason for buying the Nook Color.  Difficult to download other products.  No night time screen.  On line manual (>100 pages) is almost useless.This is my second tablet in the last month.  The first was a PanDigital Novel which I returned because it was an Android 2.0 and had limited capabilities and no access to Netflix.  AND TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE (NONE).  There is a B & N store 10 minutes from whre I live.  In the past I have spoken to the folks there and they seem very knowledgeable.  I will visit them again with my list of questions.  I'll do an update to this in a couple of weeks.Update.  Raised my rating to a 5 *.  I found out I needed to do a software update (from 1.3 to 1.4.1) in order to get NETFLIX.  The nice man at the B & N store did this for me in about 6 minutes.  I now get NETFLIX with very good reception.  At this time I really don't care about additional apps.  Everything I think I will ever want is in the NOOK Color now.  E-Mail in and out.  Downloads books from the Public Library in seconds.  Internet browsing ok.  eBay access is ok.  Bought a game for $0.99 just to check out my B & N account.  Easy.  NETFLIX was easy to set up.  Battery charge lasts longer than anticpated.

Frankly, there simply aren't a whole lot of covers to choose from when it comes to the DX version. Overall, I really am happy with my purchase.-Pros- Wonderful packaging. It comes nicely wrapped in the box, and makes you really feel like you just bought a luxury product- Cover Quality. The quality of the leather cover is great, for the price.- Overall luxurious feel. This is the greatest selling point for me. I was a (fairly) late adopter of the Kindle because of my love of books, especially the old leather bound type. This helps to satisfy that need. Sure, it adds some weight and bulk to the Kindle, but its not obnoxious or excessive. The feel and smell of the leather, combined with the weight of the product makes your Kindle feel like a million bucks.- Security of Device. The basic purpose of a cover is to add protection and keep your product secure. This cover does a great job, using tight elastic bands at each of the four corners to keep your Kindle snugly in place- The Notebook. I love the idea of being able to jot down notes or quotes as the mood strikes. I am right handed, and I know a lot of people have commented on the notebook being cumbersome to use if you are not left handed, but I personally have no problems with this layout. It feel natural. During normal use, the notebook is tucked out of the way-Cons- Admittedly, the notebook can be cumbersome. I use the elastic that is meant to hold the cover shut and wrap it around the notebook when using the Kindle, so that the cover is completely open and the notebook is essentially ""back to back"" with the Kindle. This works fine, but if you dont use the elastic to keep the notebook portion shut, it will be open and flapping around.Overall ImpressionWorth it. Especially good for those who like to take notes, love the Moleskine line of products, or have a secret guilt about giving up those marvelous old leather bound books.",4.0,"Good, but not great",1289606400,"11 13, 2010",Electronics,1.0,,

If you are a dungeon game fanatic with no euro experience, you also should keep reading. This game is a straight euro-style game, with a clever fantasy theme wrapped around it. Mechanically, it runs on worker placement and resource management principles. There are some cool cards, but the game pieces are... drumroll... wooden cubes. And some meeples. And some victory point tokens. Eurogamers will rejoice, and dungeon crawl gamers might be surprised. You won't find any miniatures here.But this is far from an average euro with cubes. It is actually a very well designed game, with many winning ways to approach it. The object is to complete Quest cards, which each show cube requirements (called adventurers) and rewards. Four types of ""adventurers"" are represented by cubes. Orange for fighters, white for clerics, black for rogues, and purple for wizards. Quests cards are colored as well. So an orange Quest (called a warfare quest) requires, as its main element, orange cubes. White Quest cards require white cubes, etc. But each will usually require a lesser amount of other resources, such as gold or other colored cubes. Victory points are rewarded for completed quests, and a few other hidden bonus points are awarded at the end.Standard stuff, right? No.This game works so well because it is fairly quick, and actions are tightly controlled because of limited places on the board to deploy your agents to obtain resources. Think Stone Age, but without as much scoring complication. It's not exactly the same, but similar. In addition to getting and completing quests, you can obtain and play Intrigue cards, which give you various actions. Other actions you can take include getting gold, and purchasing buildings. Buildings provide more spots for players to place agents, and each building gives that player more resources. Owners of the buildings also get something each time another player uses it.There are elements of several different types of games here, and they all work extremely well together. The fantasy theme provides a nice backdrop, complete with ""flavor text"" on cards and fantasy-type names assigned to buildings and pieces. It all provides extra enjoyment, added to a fine euro-style game. It's easy to teach and learn, and with one game under your belt you'll be flying through the next game. And you'll probably keep coming back, because strategies that work depend on each game and how the other players play. Replay value is high, as far as I can tell from a limited number of games so far. Everyone who has played this with me has enjoyed it, and complaints are few and minor. It's an excellent game, and one I purchased after just one play, which is quite rare for me. Hope you enjoy it!",5.0,Is this good? You better believe it!,1333065600,"03 30, 2012",Toys_and_Games,1.0,,

It was OK, but the included book and reprint of the 1st issue were great.  When they announced the Hard Drive, I decided to treat myself for Xmas, and got it.1st off, it's a fairly classy looking little drive, from an off-brand company - so durability is iffy.  Bondi had assured me before purchase that indeed, the drive's Playboy content could be backed-up onto another hard drive at any time, so that's a relief.  And they may or may not offer future issues to add to the collection, another iffy.But here's the kicker.  Only the actual centerfolds are truly sharp and clear!  Covers and pages suffer from all sorts of flaws and errors: missing pages and covers, poor scan quality, yellowed pages, crooked pages, and double-truck pages (that's where an image, ad, etc. spreads across both the left and right page) that don't line up.  No effort was made AT ALL to restore, align or color correct the scans.  In this day and age, this is just plain laziness and shows how far Playboy has fallen...anything for a buck, bleed the brand dry.As for the most practical application of this collection - viewing on an iPad - forget it (sort-of).  There's no app for the Bondi viewer, but you CAN export/print issues to an Adobe Acrobat .pdf file...with a catch.  The covers are scanned into the Bondi files as separate files, and the Bondi viewer assembles them into each issue.  To get complete issues as .pdf's, you'll need a version of Acrobat (or shareware) that can make single .pdf's from multiple .pdf's, save the covers and actual issue content, and assemble.  Note that there is no option to do years or decades...it's one issue at a time, baby....and that would be more than a bit time consuming.I've returned mine, and received confirmation of the refund within 48 hours of them receiving the drive.Coulda been a contender...but no cigar.",2.0,Playboy should be embarrassed.,1295913600,"01 25, 2011",Electronics,0.0,,

I learned enough to figure out words in reading, but didn't excel much at the oral part.  I tried this item out for that.  The other one I had for review was the Spanish one.  I gave it one star less than this, though it is pretty much the same program.  I learned more with this kit than the Spanish one, since I took four years of Spanish in high school and retain a lot of it still.  I am still not sure about how to find how much the online lessons are once my trial period of three months that you get free with the kit is over. It is hard to find on the website.  I like the games and layout of the Rosetta Stone program and I am a visual learner and this helps me with the oral part as well.  I like to see as I speak, which is hard to do with audio programs.  This has audio CDs for the car, video games for my computer and online help once I get my French up to speed.  My only complaint about this program is that you can only install in on one computer, so I have one of these on my laptop and the Spanish one on my home computer, since it takes up a good chunk of memory.  I would like the option to put these on any new computers I buy years from now, but RS has a very limited use.  It's like buying a course.  If you have a computer you will use for 5-6 years, it is really worth it.  If you work at home in a field where you need to upgrade your computer more often, you might be disappointed that you can't put it on your new computer.  I wish RS would allow at least this to be installed on two computer, in case the computer you are using fails.This is like taking one semester of French, beginner level, in high school or college.  I learned about the same thing I did in the French course in college and it is less money to do it this way.I think if you are a visual learner, you will like this product.  There is a lot of debate that kids learn better this way, but I think adults can too.  Mind you, that this teaches you very basic French and not beyond present tense really.  Just like a college course.  I like that I can see the words and tend to repeat them better when I see a picture at the same time.  Or maybe I am just a child at heart!Note: I have been using this and another Rosetta Stone for several weeks now and the headset that comes with it has a microphone that isn't so good. Or maybe with use had become not so good. Both my boyfriend and I have trouble getting the microphone to register words we say, even if we say it correctly. For example, even simple Spanish words like Si and Hola get a negative signal even though I am saying it perfectly. I continue at the same volume about 5 times and then, it finally takes it. I wonder if it will become frustrating on high levels where you have to repeat back longer sentences. My Mac doesn't have an external mic, so I have no option but to use the headset and take it off to speak as loud as I can into the microphone. It doesn't seem to matter if I do their ""1,2,3,4,5"" test at regular voice, louder or softer.

It is not meant to be tablet or an iPad replacement.  It is foremost an e-Reader with some bells and whistles.If I'm given a choice, I would not buy a Nook.  For the price, I would rather get a Kindle Fire.  I own 4 laptops, 1 iPad 2 for my wife, and 3 Kindle Fires for my kids.  Nook Color is an afterthought and it is for me.  I bought my used Nook Color on another site for $114 (free shipping) 2 weeks ago.  And it was a steal.  The Nook I received was in working order and it looked new.I had no trouble turning it on and everything worked perfectly.  The only gripe was it was extremely slow compare to some of the tablets I own.  Again, I reminded myself that this is not a tablet so I had to be fair.  The features are not too bad but the navigation was confusing at best.Fast forward to today.  B&N; was smart to release an update (1.4.1).  If you already own a Nook Color, you should get the update.  The update improves the speed dramatically.  The navigation still lacks finesse though.Here are some of the goods- I bought it cheap- It has an expansion slot.  I inserted a 16GB micro SD card and Nook recognizes it right away.- The web works fine.  It can now even watch some YouTube.  It also runs Flash.  Nook 1, iPad 0.- The new update allows NetFlix to run.- There are some apps that are extremely useful.  I love the Smithsonian Channel and Pulse.- The magazines look great.  The update also improve the navigation.- The interactive books are great.  My daughter absolutely loves it.And now the bads- I constantly look for free stuff.  Unfortunately, B&N; doesn't offer a lot of free books that are worthwhile.- The apps itself, is sad to say the least.  The offering is a fraction of what you can find in iPad and Amazon.  And most of them are costly too.- While the update improve the speed of web-surfing, it still is slower than iPad and Kindle Fire.- The speaker is terrible.  It is located on the back of the device.  If you hold the Nook on your hand, you may cover the speaker. The best solution is to use a head phone.- The navigation overall needs to be improved. It is a basic Android without much thought.  At times I don't even know whether to double-tap or hold to get more options.Here is my final take.  If you are short on cash, and would like a good e-reader/tablet.  Go get a Kindle.  If you can find a Nook for less than $150. Go for it.I would not spend more than $200 on a Nook (be it a Color/Tablet).  There are much better options out there.Update January 24, 2012I have used my Nook for a month now and all in all, I like it because it allows me to read my magazines and books.  It sure beats a 10 incher tablet.  The update 1.4.1 is definitely a must if you want to use Nook Color to its full potential.  However, I found out yesterday that the update was actually used to close the loop on dual-boot and disable any sideload of apps.  The version 1.4.0 allows the Nook to load Amazon app and the Launcher EX.  Basically it allows other apps other than B&N; to be loaded.  The automatic update 1.4.1 disable this option.  So, if you are dare enough to install other apps, you can backdate the version to 1.4.0 if you want to load other apps.Update February, 2012Nook continues to lose to Kindle Fire in terms of contents.  B&N; could not match to the behemoth of Amazon and I don't think it will ever be.  However, if you are stuck with Nook, there are a few apps that you must have (they are all free).  It helps the Nook Color to be a good companion in a boring world.- NetFlix is a must.  7 inch on your lap and plug in a pair of headphones.  You are good to go.- Smithsonian is interesting.  Want to learn something that you forgot.  This app works great but contents updates are slow.- Dolphin Internet Explorer works great for anyone wants to do quick surfing.  Very fast and very convenient.- Don't know what interest you, try Stumbleupon.  It randomly pulls internet content based on your interest.  Works great on YouTube vidoes.- Good with words, try Nook Crossword.- Who doesn't use Dropbox.  It is a must.- Springpad is great to jot down quick notes.- Pandora works great too, but you need a pair of headphones though.- Who needs newspaper when you have Pulse.",4.0,Not a bad product and close to being perfect,1323820800,"12 14, 2011",Electronics,1.0,,

The cardboard maps are fairly sturdy but miniatures are not the greatest in detail but decent and don't appear to be very sturdy. The booklets are just pamphlets and are okay but not completely through.

Solar panels and radiators are easily broken off, and the central connector for the modules suffers from being snap together, and having pretty loose fit as well.

It seems as though the parts are actually the same molds used by Revell's Snap Tite kit, just with slightly modified joining sections.

Personally, I'm especially happy that the Soyuz and Progress spacecraft can separate from the station, but beware that the Soyuz is actually used to help hold the main junction together.For the price though, the model isn't terrible if you're willing to do a little extra work gluing it.

I purchased it because of theglowing reviews I found everywhere, especially on Creative's excellent support newsgroup.Maybe my high hopes set false expectations, or maybe I'm just though to please, but I was not thrilled with my purchase.I purchased it hoping to go jogging with it, but learned from comments on the newsgroup that because of the shock I better not use it for jogging if I wanted it to continue to work.  It was also a bit too bulky and heavy for jogging.  I thought maybe I could at least use on the treadmill at the health club (i.e. put the unit on the treadmill newspaper rack instead of carrying it) but I never got a chance.Before I tried using at the treadmill, I downloaded the new firmware and installed on my unit, and after that it would not boot!  Creative's tech support said &quot;Wow, I've never heard of a problem like that.&quot;  To their credit and Amazon's, they were both very willing to allow me to return it, either for repair (at Creative) or replacement (via Amazon.)Amazon immediately shipped me another one when they got my email, but ironically they misshipped (I don't blame them, I've order many times from Amazon and this was the first mixup.)  By then, I decided to simply &quot;return&quot; it for good and wait for the item to &quot;mature.&quot;  I told them not to bother sending me another, and I returned both the dead unit and the misshipment.Additional info about the NJB: The carrying case does not have a place for the poor quality headphones, and you can't listen to the NJB when it is in the case because of headphone jack gets in the way (unless you turn the NJB sideways, then the case won't close.)On the positive side, it is a really nice to have all your music in one little box you can carry (almost) anywhere, and if I wanted to use it for different reasons (i.e. not jogging and I carried a backpack that had a pocket to carry it, and the firmware upgrade had worked) I could probably recommend it  The newsgroup is a big plus.On the other hand it is a first generation unit and I think within one year there will be some much better offerings from Creative and other companies.  If you'll be kicking yourself for spending the money today when the unit you *really* want comes out in a year, don't buy it today.  If you won't mind shelving it in a year to buy the latest and greatest, go ahead and get it; you'll probably be happy you did (but not for jogging!)",3.0,"Some good, some bad",975542400,"11 30, 2000",Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,0.0,,

I also wanted them to have a nice appearance and not look like dedicated work suspenders. These were the only ones to fit that criteria for me. The brownish burgundy color is very rich and the chrome buckles and hardware look nice and function well. I had no problem adjusting these suspenders. The range is very accommodating from small to large. They can quickly and easily be attached and removed once the loop attachments are installed on your belt by using the clasps, for bathroom breaks and such. Four loop attachments are included (one kit). I actually bought these for casual wear so I removed the heavy shoulder pads. The process is easy. (1) unbuckle both front straps. (2) slide the horizontal chest strap down and off. (3) slide the shoulder pads off. (4) reinstall the chest strap and make up the buckles. Done. You could also slide them off the back by removing that round strap guide (thing) which is the way I did it because the chest strap was so tight, I did not think that it was made to slide. It has since loosened up some. In the picture the horizontal chest strap appears to be riveted on but on my pair you can slide it and adjust the height. It is tight and requires some force to move, so it does not flop around. I would have prefered a chest strap that attached with clamps, (clamps that would not scar the leather). Mine uses leather attachment loops. These could potentialy become loose as the leather stretches, to the point where the strap might fall down, but I could be wrong. They seem a little expensive. When you break them down into their seperate components, there is not a lot to them that you could not pick up at the local hardware store for a few bucks, but what are you going to do, make them yourself, c'mon. They were delivered fast right to my front door by Fed Ex, I think it was Fed Ex. They can be a little restricting but that is the nature of suspenders, I guess. I recently removed the chest strap which makes them less restricting and more comfortable. As they break in and soften I can foresee them becoming very comfortable. These are the first pair of suspenders that I have owned and I really like them. Everything I wrote is truthful to my experierce. Yours may be completely different. If it is, I'm sorry.

She is what some would call a &#34;reluctant gamer&#34; whereas I am an avid gamer, so I have be careful about what games I introduce her to. She prefers games that rely at least a little on luck (i.e., not all strategy) and aren't too complex (i.e., where you can learn/remember the mechanic after a game or two), whereas I love strategy and complexity but don't mind a little luck. We also like games you can finish in a single session (or games you can play multiple times in a single session).TTR is fun to play and easy to learn (in fact, the USA version is the simplest of the TTR franchise). The 1910 expansion is a must (updates some old components, and adds some new ones that are really worthwhile). The luck component is based on the train cards and destination tickets you randomly draw. The strategy component is based on what routes you try to complete, some of the card choices you make (they do not always have to be random), etc.We liked the game so much that I eventually bought all four of the map collections (Asia, India & Switzerland, Africa, & Neederlands).  We don't own but have also played Nordic Countries, too.The only reasons I'm giving it 4 rather than 5 stars are (1) the 1910 expansion is so essential that it really should have been included in the base game, and (2) once you've played this version a few times this particular map will start to feel a little simple.  Knowing what I know now I probably would have started with the Europe map and 1912 expansion instead (a little more to it at first, but lots more ways to grow into the game). But, this is still a great way to learn the game, and if you happen to be from the U.S. it will be a little easier to find the cities since you'll know where everything is.",4.0,TTR U.S.A. is the way to go if you want the least complex version of the game,1399766400,"05 11, 2014",Toys_and_Games,1.0,,

I have the original D&D; Module, the box sets (TWO of them!) I have read the book (I, Strahd : The Memoirs of a Vampire) and spent countless hours playing through (and dying in) Count Strahd's castle and lands.  I love this whole series.So, I now have a son who is interested in D&D.;  Mainly because he knows how much I enjoyed it ""back in the day"" and having seen the guys on Big Bang Theory playing it recently.  Searching the internet for an easy way to break in to D&D; brings me to the board game Dungeons and Dragons Wrath of Ashardalon.  As I read the description (or maybe it was a review) I notice that there is a Ravenloft version!  I check it out, see the good reviews and buy it.Boy was I ever NOT disappointed!  This game is great.  All the fun of D&D; without the need to read a ton of books (yes, in this game there is a fair amount of reading, but not too bad) or roll a character or keep track of too much.  Yes, some hard-core D&D; people may find it a little limited and too easy, but if that is the case, just play D&D; on your own.  This game is much better for the first-timers and the uninitiated.  Very easy to play and not a lot of time invested to get there.  I mean, it's probably on par with like a good game of Risk or a real game of Monopoly (without all the shortcuts.)  Great for board game enthusiasts and the D&D; curious.The game itself is really something.  Very well-made in every way.  Good game board tiles, great cards and tokens and players and monsters too.  All very durable and cool.  Since purchasing, I have played about five games.  Once by myself to see if it was any fun alone (it actually is) and a bunch of games with my son and some others.  Every time was fun, even when we lost (some of the dungeons can be very hard!) and I can't wait to play more.I highly recommend this game if you are looking for a fun board game with friends for a few hours and you like the idea of D&D; without all the books and commitment.",5.0,Ravenloft without the commitment,1370390400,"06 5, 2013",Toys_and_Games,1.0,,

Mix it yourself with this easy-to-use machine.  Even basic flavors are great when you control the ingredients that go in.The machine is not messy, as it requires no ice or rock salt, and all of the parts are fairly easy to wash.  The recipes in the instruction book work just fine.A bit of advice;1)Read the instructions carefully.2)Plan for some lead time.  You need to have the bowl completely frozen. (If you need to make more than one batch at a time, you can buy an extra freezer bowl.)3)Bear in mind that the ice cream will still be soft when the machine is done with it. (This is true with most ice cream machines.) You will still need to put it in the freezer for a while before serving.4)Indulge in high quality ingredients; for example, get some whole vanilla beans for your vanilla ice cream. (If you want a lot of them, eBay is the cheapest place to get them.)I am delighted with this purchase and just can not imagine buying ice cream from the store again.",5.0,Ice cream just the way you want it!,1116892800,"05 24, 2005",Home_and_Kitchen,1.0,,

That is the reason that I wanted to try this machine.I LOVE MY MACHINE!Granted, it is a little noisy but I still love it. We can hardly wait, so we are dipping into the frozen yogurt from the opening in the top while it finishes.I like to have my frozen yogurt in a &quot;soft-serve&quot; consistency which is great when it is fresh out of the machine. When I put the leftovers in the freezer it gets really hard. I have found that if I take the frozen yogurt out of the freezer and put it into the refrigerator for about 4 hours it is soft serve again. I pack a container in my lunch box in the morning and at lunch it is great!The easiest way to make frozen yogurt (in my opinion) is:a 32oz. container of Dannon Lite Vanilla Yogurt (sweetened with fructose and aspartame).Add one of the following for flavor:2 Tablespoons of 100% fruit jam (strawberry is wonderful)ORabout 1/2 cup of sugarfree jello (prepared to package directions). I flake the jello up with a fork and dump it in. Orange Jello is great!It takes two minutes to dump the two ingredients in and 20 minutes later we are in heaven.",5.0,Super easy frozen yogurt,1024876800,"06 24, 2002",Home_and_Kitchen,1.0,,
