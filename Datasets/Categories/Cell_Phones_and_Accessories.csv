The type of music that I listen to are not hip/pop, rock or rap which has a lot of bass.  I do have the phone BT audio volume turned to the max and likewise fairly loud for the car audio volume (probably because the audio signal is weak).

{'$oid': '5a1321d5741a2384e802c6a1'},A33IJGLTVS5MDS,3283005737,Trailman,"[9, 11]","When I made the decision to spend $1593.75 (including shipping) on my charcoal Glass II Explorer last November, I had expectations for what I could use it for. Here is a report on what those were, what other uses I discovered, and how Glass fared in regard to each use.A better action video camera?I had high hopes for Google Glass to be a replacement for my $50 bullet camera with better battery life, better image quality (because of the wide-angle lense) and better operability (because I see what it records and can pause it etc).The verdict: Glass fails in this category. The battery life is even shorter (30 minutes tops with a full battery right off the charger). I can wear it under my aero-helmet, but not without feeling pressure. This is a no-go on even the shortest bike rides or runs. The low-light capability is not great, either, and on my night runs with a head light there is not much to see on the resulting video.It does not fit under or over ski goggles, and the clear or active shades do not replace goggles (too small and too much draft that will tear up eyes at higher speeds).An in-vehicle or dashboard camera?A camera that reliably and continuously records what happens around me when I drive would be great. Glass is promising, because it captures my field of view, including the rear view mirror, but it is not reliable and cannot record continuously. When plugged in, the battery life would be no issue, but there is currently no app that records continuously (and overwrites earlier clips when memory runs out). Also, the display is always on when it records video, which is bothersome at night.With a little bit of practice it is possible to wake up Glass and get into video recording mode in a matter of a few seconds, but that is not fast enough in unexpected situations.My verdict: I think that the device has potential in this category with the right software. Currently it is limited.A better run/ride tracker?I saw that Strava has Glass apps even before I placed my Glass order, and I uploaded my entire workout history from Garmin to Strava in anticipation of using their apps with Glass.The verdict: Glass fails in this category, but my reasoning requires explanation, because admittedly this is the fault of my Nexus 5 and not so much the fault of Glass. Glass relies on the GPS sensor of the phone, and the Strava app only works when the phone is paired. Unfortunately my Nexus 5s GPS sensor data appears to be very inaccurate. When I started a ""Run"" on Strava while walking the dog, it placed me some 50 yards away from the road that I was on. I will continue to depend on the good old Garmin 305 in the coming years.In addition to issue with GPS accuracy, I don't take Glass on runs because I sweat a lot from the head and both the power button and the bone-conduction speaker would be exposed and allow sweat (or rain water!) to enter the device.A better headset?A resounding no here. The bone conduction speaker vibrates and tickles behind my ear. Having longer conversations on Glass is uncomfortable. The sound quality is moderate at best, and many times there is some kind of mechanical obstruction that causes strong distortions, to a point where I cannot understand the other party. I keep my Glass clean and protected, so I am not sure what causes the distortion. Maybe a tiny dust particle is all it takes.The ear bud speaker that is now included with Glass is too cumbersome to deal with for me. Glass is already bulky and in the way when you take if off because you can't simply fold it and put it in your shirt pocket. Now having something dangling on a USB cord attached to Glass is a non-starter. I have not even taken the ear bud out of the box yet.A hands-free smart phone controller?Being able to control important features of your phone without actually having to look at it or even hold in your hand is a compelling feature. If you use Gmail and Hangouts exclusively, you are being well-served by Glass. You will be alerted by and can read instant messages. and respond to and write instant messages and emails by using the voice recognition that works pretty reliably for me.I don't seem to be able to create emails from scratch, only instant messages to one of up to 10 contacts. I do see emails in my Gmail inbox, though. They appear as a new slide in the timeline and I can respond to them without ever touching Glass. This is pretty cool.The verdict: Unfortunately, I use neither Gmail nor Hangouts, and I frankly don't get Hangouts. I cannot access emails on my company's Exchange server or my personal IMAP service from Glass, and while I have over 1,000 contacts on my phone, I only see 14 contacts on Glass. This pretty much renders Glass useless as a communication device.A better navigation device?I really like the way navigation works. I have one car with a built-in navigation system and will not use Glass there - it certainly does not compete with the Mercedes Comand System. In my other car I do not have a navigation system at all, and previously I had to meddle with the phone when I needed directions. This works so much better on Glass.My verdict: Navigation is definitely a compelling use of the product, in the car as well as on the bike or on foot (even though Google Maps lacks trail data). Based on some recent incidents that made national headlines, it appears that there is currently doubt among law enforcement officers whether using Glass while driving is legal and safe. I can attest that it can be surprising and distracting when Glass comes to live in full brightness during a night drive to alert you of an upcoming turn, but I don't find it all that different from having a GPS device in the car that is on all the time.A better music streaming device?With access to Google Music and completely hands-free operation through voice-activated searches, Glass offers yet another compelling use.My verdict: Exciting possibilities, but currently we have to compromise on either poor audio quality or complicated handling/wiring of ear buds. The mono ear bud that comes with Glass is, well, mono only; stereo ear buds are available for an extra $85, and my ears aren't made for ear bud-type headphones anyway. They tend to hurt and fall out, and the same is true for the ear bud that came with Glass. Overall, I am somewhat indifferent about Glass' current usefulness as a music streaming device.Other uses?Glassware can be installed from the phone or the computer. The current selection of applications that work with Glass is limited (I just counted 35), which I find surprising, given how long Glass has been available to the development community already.My verdict: The speed of adoption among application developers seems to be slow and the number of available applications is small. I am confident that this will change. Still, no more than a null-vote on other uses at this time.A mature and well-tested device?I run into odd and unexpected situations with Glass almost daily that require some tinkering to figure out. Examples?*The on-head detection is flakey and sometimes shuts off Glass unexpectedly. I figured this out myself and the chatter on the Explorer forums confirmed my diagnosis. I just disabled this feature entirely.*The ""Ok Glass"" command stopped working on the 3rd day. I had to do a factory reset to get it back.*When I did a factory reset, it took several attempts and an uninstall of the MyGlass app on the Nexus 5 before I was able to pair them again. Glass would just not get into pairing mode.*Currently, phone calls or navigation don't work while on a Wifi connection, even though I am paired and connected with the Nexus 5. There is no way to ""disable"" the wireless connection temporarily. You have to make Glass ""Forget"" the connection to make a call and then recreate it. The phone reports the Bluetooth profile ""Phone Audio"", not ""Headset"" as one would expect.*I am perpetually confused by what contacts I get to see on Glass. I understand that I can add up to 10 contacts from my phone that will show up on Glass as separate slides. So far I added 5 contacts. When I want to make a phone call, I am presented with 14 contact choices, though, the same people that appear in my Hangouts on Google. With half of them I have had no contact in years and I don't have the slightest idea how they ended up there.My overall verdict:The head-mounted display and its possibilities are exciting and an indication that this technology will become pervasive in the very near future. But Glass appears to still be an experimental device that does not excel in any particular discipline, comes with a high price tag, and that non-techie consumers will struggle with. The short battery life severely limits its practical use and spoils the fun.I no longer keep my Glass charged and use it maybe once a month. It still works as a conversation-starter. If you expect anything more than that, you will be disappointed.",1.0,Charcoal paper weight,1399507200,"05 8, 2014",Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,0.0

I actually think it is more comfortable to hold my S4 with this case on than without. The little kickstand seems flimsy, so I don't use it in fear that it will break off. The battery on this case will do about a 70% charge, they make cases with bigger batteries but those are also bulky and heavy. The battery is only rated at 500mAh, so it does take a while to charge the phone. You can charge the case and battery at the same time by switching on the power for the case while it is plugged in, but ONLY do this with a 500mA charger!! If you use the S4's stock 2A charger, it will get extremely hot, which can destroy the battery or possibly damage the phone. You can also connect the phone to your computer through USB while the case is on, you just have to turn on the battery with the power button. My only complaint is that the LED's are extremely bright. I like to lay in bed and read the news on my phone, and I have to turn the case off because the lights are blinding/distracting.Overall, it is a great product for the money, it is sturdy, comfortable, and best of all it gets me through the entire day of heavy phone use!

Further, if you should have to use your phone why the batteries charging it, it's a lose lose situation.With that said, if you were casual user, and you just need an extra battery pack to get you through a long day, and you don't lose your phone all the time (and while it is charging), this case might be a good product for you.I will say that I liked the design for the most part.

Because of the way the charger cover pivots on a rubber hinge on the i617 (Blackjack 2), the charger actually plugs in crooked and doesn't get a ""flush"" connection like the USB adapter and wall charger that come with the phone.  It feels like after using it for a bit it could do damage to the rubber hinge, which in my opinion is already one of the weak points of the phone.I can't make a recommendation on a better car charger because this is the only one I tried.  I gave it two stars because even though it doesn't plug in straight, it still does work.

The graphics on the back are sharp, the Gameboy stuff is 3-D and looks really good.  Overall, nice quality.  The only downside:  like all cases of this type, the softness means that certain parts are a bit loose, like the left/right edges, and the thin part near the speaker/mic end.

The bottom slot is lower, presumably 1 or 1.5 amps.-Fits well in my charging socket - holds tight.  I've had some that were loose in my charging socket.-Works well to charge my iPhone in the top slot and the bottom slot works with most Android phones, except the very high end ones.-Has a blue LED light to tell you it is on and ready to charge.-The USB sockets seem to be well made and tightly fit all my cables.-Pretty solid construction.-It cost less than $2.Cons:-It died on me after 3 months.I had really enjoyed using this USB charger.  It rapidly charged my iPhone and worked well with charging the phones of my family and friends.  The two slot design makes this design very handy; with a 1 slot design, no one else can charge their device unless I remove my cord.  Of course, after this charger died, I had to go back to the 1 slot design I was using before.After 3 months, I began to notice the LED light flickering.  It was less than a week later that is quit working permanently.  I'm not sure what the problem was - faulty wiring, bad design, I guess I'll never know.  I thought about getting another since they are so cheap, but then I thought better of it.

I just needed something to charge my ipad in the car and this turned out to be much better than that.Lets start off with the basics.  This charger has two ports, only one is the high voltage one that will charge your ipad(i think its 2 amps or something).  You have to make sure that you plug your ipad into the high voltage one or it will charge veryyyyy slowly.  Of the two ports one is in the middle and one is on top of that.  It is the top one that is the high output.  There is a little sticker that tells you this on the actual device but you wouldn't know its there unless someone told you(look closely youll find it).  Note to manufacturer, make that sticker in white or something, its almost impossible to read in black.As a little bonus this charger has a blue led that lights up the clear plastic when its plugged in which is nice because a simple glance will tell you whether its connected or not.  Another little bonus is that if you plug your iphone into the high output socket it will charge the entire battery in about an hour!  That's A++ in my book, especially if you use the GPS a lot which drains the iphone pretty fast.Overall I am very happy with this item.  So much so that I ordered three more to replace all my chargers... Who knows what else will charge faster with this thing.

After reading all of the bad reviews on this one, I still really liked the design so I figured I'd go ahead and order it, and also order another rubberized snap-on case, different design. When I got the cases, they were both beautiful, especially this one. The design looks exactly like in the picture and it wasn't broken like a lot of people are saying. It was in perfect condition and also fits the phone perfectly. But the case is not rubberized (neither one of them). In fact, there's barely much plastic to it at all....one drop and this case would be history. Would it protect the phone? Maybe. But no rubber at all...I was hoping to get a plastic case with a rubber coating, to provide some type of shock resistance in the event of a drop. But no can do. The title also says something about a faceplate? I don't know what that means but there was no ""faceplate"", just a case. But hey you get what you pay for.

It looks stained like somebody's makeup was left on it and they didn't clean it off.The rubberized covering isn't really all that ""rubbery"" and mostly just a smooth surface. Also, its takes the jaws of life to pry off the covering! I tried to replace the screen protector on it and the indention on the left side of the case was big enough for my fingernail to pry it but i ended up using a little screwdriver to take it off from an opening on top of the phone while trying not to scratch or damage it. So if there was a separate rating for overall look. i'd give it 5 stars for the design only. The quality of the product is poor, and i hate to give it a bad rating, but the case i received does not look brand new at all.

Fortunately, I did have a 120-volt Nokia N97 charger in my laptop bag, and had a 12-volt to 120-volt converter for my netbook, so I was able to get by.  [Finding a Nokia N97 charger, with the almost proprietary USB style connector at Radio Shack or Walmart is not going to happen].When I returned from the trip, I ordered a ""no name"" aftermarket 12-volt charger for the phone.  It turned out to be unreliable.  That was a wasted $7.I went back to Amazon, and bought this official Nokia charger for about $10 more than the aftermarket chargers.  I was kicking myself for initially ""saving"" $10 for a no-name charger for my very expensive phone.  What if it had damaged the phone?  I had spent a lot of money for a very high end phone, and then risked killing it by using a $10 cheaper charger.  Where's the logic in that?  Why risk your $600 phone by using a $7 charger, when the official Nokia charger is just $10 more. D'oh!This charger works as it should.  It charges the phone quickly, doesn't do anything weird to the car radio, and doesn't get hot.  The peace of mind, knowing that it isn't likely to damage the phone, or start a fire in the car, is worth far more than the extra $10 cost.  I wouldn't know about doing a technical review of this charger.  Somewhere, I read that there's a microchip logic in the charger.  If so, that could have been the problem with the cheap charger. This one works very well, doing what it's supposed to do.  I didn't give it 5 stars because Nokia is almost certainly overcharging...(Get it?

My charger worked fine for about 2 months. Between regular usage on my Samsung Epic and letting people in the car with the same port plug in their phone, the charger no longer works properly. In the beginning, I could talk on the phone or have it in any position while charging. Over the 2 months the charger started getting more particular about what position it could be charged in. As of the review it only works with the phone in a horizontal position on my center console. The blue LED status light does let me know when it's charging or not, but this is small consolation when I have a near dead battery and a call comes in. From outside appearances the charger appears fine, but either the wiring near the phone port connector is weakened or the port connector itself is faulty. I have since tested other chargers on my phone and they work fine so it is not a phone or car power outlet problem. If I was stuck somewhere with a dead battery and the price was at or near $5 as it is here, I would buy this. So, other than for emergency or a cheap backup I would spring for something better.Pros- Price. You can't beat the at or near $5 price. Can leave charger plugged even when not in use.Cons- Poorly made. Cord is too short. Great in a pinch only. Will more than likely not function in a few monthsP.S. Another recommendation would be to only use your charger on your phone or the same model. Even though the ports are supposed to be universal, I believe it helped speed up my charger being finicky. Your friends and family may hate you for being ""stingy"" with your charger but at least it has a better chance of working for your phone later. Besides, they don't really need their phone when they're with you, all their attention should be on you...Lol",2.0,Good in a pinch! Only..,1315526400,"09 9, 2011",Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,0.0

It seems to charge okay, but the length is the problem.  It has that spirral retracting cord, and if one  was to extend it as far as possible. it MIGHT be 6.5 feet long.  However, one could never use it that way because the thing pulls back into the coiled position that is not more than maybe two feet.  This makes it almost impossible to plug into your socket and do anything other than place the phone on your seat. While driving, the phone very easily slides off the seat and onto the floor when you make even an easy right turn.  Frustrating.  The main reason I bought this was because of the advertised length. I knew upfront from looking at the picture that it was probably all of not truly 6.5 feet, but this is ridiculous.  So, don't believe the thing is really longer than 2 feet, if that.Update, 3/8/13: After using this thing for a couple of days in my car, I find that the comments made by other reviewers about the defective connection of the charger cord to the phone is something that is occurring with mine as well. I find that I have to disconnect this thing several times before it actually makes a hot connection. So, this problem combined with my initial complaint about the lack of useable cord length, would rate a no-star grade.  DON'T but thing thing.

This is a bad piece of charger and it doesn't do any good job in replacing my lost original small square wall USB charger that came with my Samsung Galaxy S2 (Epic 4G Touch since I have the sprint version). Does it charge your battery, YES, but how well? That's a big question.Before going any further I would like to mention that I have a brand new battery which I purchased on Feb 2013. The battery has been charging well when I charge it from my PC using the given USB cable. But this wall charger has completed disappointed me. Now onto the major problems:1. It is snail snow in getting my battery charged. With my original charger I was able to charge my cell from 10% to 100% in roughly 3 hours. But this one takes 5-6 hours to get to only 80%. Doesn't serves the purpose as a travel charger. :(2. I have noticed my battery compartment getting really hot when I charge it using this product. I am afraid it will damage my phone.

It also makes quite a bit of heat, even if not plugged into the phone.  Clearly it wastes electricity and cooks itself.Unfortunately, the one I ordered failed after 6 months of half time use as I have one at each of two locations I frequent.

It's also really compact and comparable to Mophie case.The first problem I noticed was the design of the top part of the case. Since it's very short, it seems a bit flimsy and easy to look. Since I'm not planning to use this as every day case but only for when I go bike riding or skiing (GPS and other trackers kill the battery pretty quickly) I was willing to live it.The biggest problem was that after using it once, the case stopped working. Even after charging it for few hours it wouldn't hold the charge or it wouldn't turn on.Pros:- Nice design- Very slim and light- It uses the same lighting cable as your iPhone (HUGE plus)- Dirt cheapCons:- Top cover easy to loose- Questionable durability (but for $25 it's worth the gamble)I'm sure it's possible I got a bad case, but since I'll have to return it, I'll probably try a different model with a more solid locking system.",2.0,Died after the first use,1395619200,"03 24, 2014",Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,0.0

I expect if Pathmark sold electronic accessories, this would be on the aisles.The core item itself is relatively hard plastic, spray painted with the color and texture of choice. When attached to the phone, it fits well enough but it is not seamless. The paint job is slap-dash and only on the outer side of the skin. It's unevenly applied with a fair amount of spill over onto the side that actually contacts the phone. Additionally, there was what I can only describe as ""schmutz"" on inside of the skin, the side that contacts the phone. I'm guessing it's residue from the painting process, be it paint or whatever it was mounted on during the paint process. I had to wash the thing and scrub it a bit with paper towel before I dared bring it near my phone.Last but not least, there were no assembly instructions. Now, I'm sure if you've had a belt clip before, or a degree in mechanical engineering, or an IQ to rival Bobby Fisher, you probably could have figured out how to put it together in no time flat. Without the instructions or past experience to guide me, however, it took me quite a while of poking, pushing, prodding and experimenting before I figured out how it all came together. Thankfully it was only 4 pieces, but it was still a bit annoying. I work for a manufacturing company, pretty much everything we make comes with an instruction sheet, even the simplest of items.This is an ok product. I'm sure you can get better for the price. I will look forward to the coming months when more manufacturers throw their hats into the Samsung Jack accessory ring.

Would have made more sense to put the tab near the holes so they could be matched up instead of guessing.  Even once on evenly, the camera circles and edges leave air bubbles.  I have used screen protectors on my other phone (Vibrant) and they went on literally within a few seconds and were bubbleless.  Also, the thickness of these make the touch screen less sensitive, which is a negative.

There are no instructions so, through trial and error, I discovered that the case would only fit if the original back plate was removed. To be honest I'm not sure how comfortable I am with this.Aesthetically, the graphics are appealing. the method in which they are applied to the back of the case give them an almost 3D aspect. The ""rubberized"" coating is still somewhat slick to the touch so don't get too lax when holding it and don't expect it to -not- slid off of your dash board.Aside from the above issues with the roughness of the edges I would have given it 4 stars had the sender not forgotten to send the iTuffy flannel bag and the screen protector.

There really isn't that much offered out right now. Went ahead and tried this case now because it was cheap and the skull design was kind of cool. Shipping was quick and I received it in less then a week. I'm a little disappointed in the quality of the product. First off this one came with a pouch cover. Just a felt pouch, really cheap. It had drawstrings that broke the second I tried to pull on them. The bag was a waste of time and I don't even use it. Might be good for me to keep wee.. umm I mean other things in but not my cell phone. The case itself had a rubber like coating on the outside, it felt OK and offered a better grip over the feel of the normal phone. It didn't add to much bulk to the phone. The things I didn't like is that though the outside of the case was coated in a black the inside of the case was gray and not coated at all, when the phone is placed into the case you can definitely see the gray borders which makes the phone look cheap. The case slides onto the phone so it's not as secure as I would like. The build quality of the case make it so it doesn't aligned perfectly with the front and back bezels.

It lasted about a year and did its job of protecting my phone very well.  My daughter had the same cover and hers lasted a few months less.  Any cover for a phone with a slide out keypad has a tendency to wear down over time at the tiny corner clips that hold it to the phone...it just depends on how often you use your phone's slide out feature.  It fit my Sprint Samsung Epic phone very well with one small exception -- there was no hole for the tiny red charging light that turns to blue when the phone is done charging.  You could see the light glow slightly through the plastic, but an actual hole there would have been easier to see.  This cover is mildly rubberized which can be both a plus and a minus -- there was a tiny bit of drag as I would slide it into my side pocket, but that same rubberized feature also kept it from sliding out of my side pocket when I'd sit down.

The bag shown and described is flannel, but I received one made of stretchy neoprene (or something similar) that is difficult to get over the entire phone. I am very disappointed in the screen protector. It comes sandwiched between two plastic pieces with numbered tabs on either side. The instructions say to pull tab 1 to remove the rear piece, then apply it to the phone, then pull tab 2 to remove the front piece, leaving only the actual screen protector on the phone. Unfortunately, mine was mislabeled (1 & 2 were switched) so I inadvertently separated the screen protector from the front piece first. I ended up with bits of lint under the screen protector because I had set the back piece, which shouldn't have had the screen protector attached, on my couch. In addition, one light swipe of my fingernail scratched the screen protector. Surprised that a screen protector would scratch so easily, I did the same thing to another device with a screen protector and was unable to scratch it.

The case fits my EVO very snug, it snaps tight around it and appears to be secure.  The case itself is a clear plastic which has been painted silver on the inside and the design printed on the out, which gives it the appearance of hovering over the silver.  Everything is accessible with the case on.  The case sticks out far enough in back so that when my phone is set down on the back, the camera's lens does not touch the table - this was one of my big reasons for buying a case.It has that rubberized plastic feel, so its easy to grip, but not sticky.  The downside of this case is three things: when you look at the back you can see outlines in the silver paint where the mold has a seam where each of the plastic tabs holding it together are, they are like faint squares underneath and at the edges you can make out the tabs. Because of the busy design its not like this is all you see, but its very visible if you look at the case.  This is because the surface of the inside of the case has these in it, and since the case is painted from the inside they are visible. Second, the design does not wrap, the wrong part of the case is made with the exact design as the back side, so that the kind of ""9"" piece is on the side of the front of the case on the right side of the phone. This means that the design seams at the side, rather than wrapping around.  Third, and most importantly, the seams at the sides of the case just make the case look cheap. They are slightly raised and are not at all invisible.  I think if the company had taken the time to smooth the seams before painting the case, it would look much better. You can't of course try to do that yourself because you would just wear off the design and make it look worse.That said, the case is less than ten dollars, so I'm not expecting perfection here.  The case fits well and will do its job for the time being I am planning to use it.Update: Changing to 1 star - Have had the case 2 weeks, the pattern and texture are now flaking off.  I'm going to buy a new case, as this one is just crap.",1.0,"Pretty design, fits snug, but cheap craftmanship",1281830400,"08 15, 2010",Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,0.0

It doesn't quite fit that snug- the material bends on the upper and lower borders of the case so that it doesn't quite cover the borders entirely. Also, there's a hole in the upper right-hand corner of the case. I thought that the bumper would prevent the phone from getting scratched, but I tested it by rolling that corner on my desk and there is a possibility that the phone could get dented. This is a strange design because we buy cases so that the phone will not get scratched, and why should we pay for something that has a hole in it that will not protect the phone?

The buttons line up and are not too difficult to press, however the power button does feel that I have to give it a decent push to have it react.The lip that wraps to the front face doesn't quite wrap completely onto the front, on the bottom edge I can see the silver of the case edge, but around the top I do not.  It is almost as though it is not quite deep enough to wrap fully around it.  It does however fit tight enough that it won't fall or slip off the phone.I also found that the USB cutout is a bit off center.  This doesn't effect the connection of the cable I have (which is pretty skinny around the connector), however it would interfere with a larger cable end.The protection is something, but doesn't feel that it is a lot.  The rubber is a bit stiff and I wonder if it was dropped how much it would absorb.  It would however protect it from marks or scrapes because it does wrap completely around the face with a small lip.For the price this gives you the basic protection, without being too big or pricey.

It's not as slim as some of the others I got, nor as stylish, but for $3 it's an unbeatable value and offers better protection than many cases that are 8x as much $. In fact the case LOOKS thicker than it is because the edging on the front protrudes out from the screen more so than most hard-plastic cases. This could be a good thing though as it will keep the screen well away from the surface it's laying on. The camera is also sufficiently protected. I like how the material wraps the entire phone, protecting all edges of the device.

Other vendors may have different molds, thus why some reviewers are complaining about needing to cut extra holes or widening holes.This is a wonderful TPU case. For less than $3, the case fits all the needs I have for my new phone. It has the right holes on all sides and I didn't need to cut any holes out for the top mic nor the microusb jack at the bottom, as different sized microusb cables fit perfectly. As others have previously mentioned, it feels like the rubber from a rollerblade wheel and is very shiny. It also attracts fingerprints, but they wipe away very easily.As for the weight and ""bulkiness"", the case did not add any noticeable weight to the phone; while the case does slightly add to the thickness of the walls of the phone, it is a snug fit and almost felt like nothing was increased in size.I will try to record a video for this case later today and update this review.",5.0,Perfect for ATT SGH-i777 (from Electromaster vendor),1324252800,"12 19, 2011",Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,1.0

The tacky parts on the sides of the case give a good grip while on calls and the texture of the case provides a good grip when holding the phone with one hand. The case is not super glossy or anything and doesn't reflect light off of it which is a good thing in my opinion. The cutouts are well-placed in all the needed spots while the power and volume buttons are still covered.

I ordered three different cases from three different sellers. The other two, to see which I could get first. This one, I liked the design and was interested. The price was also a big selling point.The case fits great, it is thinner than the other tpu cases I tried and I like that it doesn't add any material near the speaker so my ear may press firmly on the speaker. The design looks very clear and well thought out. The case has a kind of matte finish and those parts aren't tacky.However, it does have two smooth sections that a right handed person would keep their thumb and fingers on while talking on the phone that are a little tacky. Just enought to give it a firm grip. the power button is not cut out but rather has space for the button and presses with little effort.The little circle on the back actually extends pass the phone creating a pivot point. It doesn't extend much but enough that it is difficult ""swyping"" on the keyboard because the phone will spin.",5.0,WOW!!! I LOVE IT!,1309910400,"07 6, 2011",Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,1.0

The case provides enough friction to enable a good grip on the phone. TPU (the plastic material where the case is made of) virtually resists oil and dust. I used to have an Otter box for my other phone. The protection is excellent BUT the silicone attracts dust like crazy. The S-Style pattern at the back is more of a personal taste - some people like it but some other may not. To me it adds some flavor to an otherwise plain black case. The protection on all 4 sides on the front panel looks sufficient (anyone dare to slam your phone on the floor to test it out?). I wish the top margin (above the earphone) can wrap down by a few mm.

Also, not a big deal, but I wonder how long before the bright and colorful Owl starts to come off.However, with all this said, I DID just get the case today and have not actually put it to use.  I will re-review after 3 months!One more thing to add: after putting the case ON my phone, it felt very secure.  It took me a while to take it off, which I believe is the point of the case next to how well it can withstand drops.  The stylus fits securely in the earphone port as well :)",4.0,Pink/Green owl case for HTC ONE M7,1368057600,"05 9, 2013",Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,1.0

Also, my cousin actually works for Samsung in South Korea and said yes, THIS WILL IN FACT WORK on the S4, the S4 was designed to be compatible with this.As all buyers above, I also had a choice, I could buy this one and save a LOT of money because it is 3 months old and also works on the S3, Note 2, and S4 (it will also work on the Note 3 by the way according to my cousin).  OR, buy the $50+ one that currently only ships from the UK, that is part number ET-H10FAUWEGWW.  That is the newest one that works on the S4 and doesn't require power by the way, but you pay for it and it's in white, I wanted a black one.Anyway, it works.  Here is how I did it.1.  Phone Off, TV OFF.2.  Plug in everything to adapter (phone and hdmi cable) and make sure Micro-USB power cord that is 1A or 1,000ma or you burn it out. Plug into TV.  I used a 2.1 amp one, blew out my first one.  Don't do that! =)3.  Turn on TV FIRST, set to right HDMI input, on AUTO, 60Hz if you have that option.  On my older TV, I had to use 720p and 60Hz so try that if you have issues.  **I think doing this first is necessary so the phone can see a TV signal and ""sync"" up to device correctly the first time.4.

Previously I had a Galaxy S-2 and used an &#34;off the shelf&#34; Adapter.  It was a Plug and Play and it worked great.Now Samsung said that we MUST USE their &#34;official Adapter.  Well, it does not Plug and Play.  After 2 hours trying it with my homes  3 TV's,  2 Monitors (none are Samsung) and another Samsung S-4 phone...I quit.  Today at my business I tried the connection to one TV and one Monitor.  Still nothing.The only messages I received on the Phone Screen is&#34; No Device Found&#34; or  &#34;unable to mirror due to hardware failure.&#34;  Over and over on every attempt the &#34;Mirror&#34; MESSAGE.  My Old S-2 did not require anything except to connect it.Today, I started a &#34;chat&#34; with Samsung.  For 45 minutes I took the Battery out two times, restarted three times and rest the Cache once.  Finally the Agent connected me to a live person who I gave information on my phone.Then I was passed to a live person in Texas.  A person named Kala asked again what my problem was.  By this time I have been on Holds and discussions for more that 45 minutes.After explaining my problem, she asked if all connecting TV's, cables and power sources were Samsung Brand.  I said the only thing Samsung is the Phone and Adapter.  She immediately told me that Samsung only GUARANTEES that the Successful Connection with all Samsung Products. She was not interested in discussing a solution.Here &#34;lecture&#34; on GUARANTEES sounded like she has been through this many times before.  She stayed on point and did not change to &#34;I want to help you&#34;.  She would not answer  why the Box and Instructions had no words about the exact usage of the Product.  I hung-up as I was not getting a explanation about why the Adapter is not advertised with caveats.Why wouldn't the Box and Instructions with the Adapter make any note or issue with this fact.  Amazon's site does not explain that it does not or may not work with other maker's products.She repeated only GUARANTEED WITH SAMSUNG.  She said they had no other way to identify the failed  of a connection.It is disappointing after all of this and the Seller and Samsung &#34;touting&#34; of the Official Samsung Adapterthat I end up shipping it back to Amazon.Now I am suspect of everything Samsung represents in their products promotional advertising.I would like to know if anyone has this working on a TV other than Samsung.

This Amazon item is one of the top search results when looking for an MHL adapter for a Samsung Galaxy S4.  The item heading says it is for the Galaxy S4/SIV, and nowhere in the heading does it mention the S3/SIII.  Yet, when I received this item the box was clearly marked that this MHL adapter is for the S3.  If you read the other reviews, you will find that this has happened to everyone else as well.  The item description also states that this adapter will work on the S4 and s3.  It may work on the S3, who knows, but it does NOT work on the S4 as stated!  I have tried to use this MHL adapter on  multiple televisions using different HDMI cables/ports, and I have tried using my Samsung GS4 retail charger, a Samsung OEM S4 travel charger, and generic chargers.  No configuration has been able to get this item to work on the S4.  Every time my GS4 gives a message that it is ""unable to mirror due to hardware failure.""  I have a different MHL adapter that works just fine.  So I know the problem is not with any other components.  It appears that everyone posting reviews has had the same problems and has been unable to get this item to work on the S4.  This item simply does not work.  You have been warned.  If you ignore these reviews and buy this item, then do not complain when it does not work and you have to return it.Buy your MHL adapter elsewhere.*** UPDATE ***I purchased my item from the seller ""ConneVity."" I asked for authorization to return the item and get a refund.  (Most sellers would just approve the authorization, I would ship the item, and they would refund my money.  Not so easy in this case.) ConneVity, to their credit, was very prompt in their responses and their communications were very polite.  However, they were not very helpful.  I feel like I was getting the run-around.  When I asked for a refund they offered an exchange.  They tried to explain to me that the old S3 MHL adapters are the same as the new S4 MHL 2.0 adapters, just that the packaging is different.  When I pointed out how incorrect that was, ConneVity responded with reasons why the old S3 MHL adapter was useful.  Such as how the old S3 adapter can be used on the new S4 and the older S3.  I pointed out that I still wanted a refund because I don't have an S3 and it does NOT work with my S4.  Initially, ConneVity also tried to tell me that nothing was wrong with the item and it was the settings in my S4 that had to be changed.  Twice they said the S4 is not set up to mirror using MHL by default.  I pointed out how that was not true.  My other MHL adapter mirrors with no setting changes, just plug-and-play.  All the video and written tutorials online also demonstrate how the S4 mirrors using MHL by just plugging in the adapter.  I even linked to a written tech tutorial.  Finally, ConneVity admitted that it sounded like the MHL adapter I got was bad.  Now this is when things went from bothersome to truly aggravating.  ConneVity sent me an email containing the following procedure for obtaining a refund.""Requires 100% feedback so I can prove to Amazon it works andthey let me force full refunds for future customers.  Then, I email aprepaid label, you return it, email when sent in the mail and I'll issuea full 100% refund, no Amazon penalty, refund issued within 2 businessdays of return shipping confirmation.""They require that I give them 100% (positive?) feedback in order to get a full refund on an item that does not work.  They say that I need to prove to Amazon that the item works in order to get a refund when I am returning the item BECAUSE it does not work.  (And no one who left a review has been able to get this item to work on the S4.)  They seem to imply that otherwise I will be penalized by Amazon.  Is that a threat?  You read the message and decide for yourself.  Either way, I do not trust this seller so I went directly to Amazon to verify the truth of the procedure given to me.  I just wanted to know if any of this was actually true.  The Amazon representative who responded was kind enough to file one of Amazon's ""A-Z Guarantee"" claims for me and is contacting the seller directly!  Amazon also filed a claim with their Seller investigation team because ConneVity's return policy violates Amazon's community rules.At one point, ConneVity was even signing their emails as ""Amazon.com for ConneVity"" to make it look like I was actually dealing with Amazon employees.  Amazon representatives assured me the person I was talking with was the seller.  Just constant tricks and dishonesty.Just trying to save everyone else a headache.***UPDATE***Again, seller was ConneVity.  Amazon issued a full refund in the form of a gift card, told me to throw out the adapter, stop all communication with the seller, and let Amazon handle it.  (Amazon can always be trusted to do the right thing for customers.  Thank you Amazon.)  Yet seller still contacted me and tried to trick/scare me into editing and removing my feedback.  I contacted Amazon, and Amazon representatives informed me that pretty much everything the seller told me was false.  Sara, ConneVity's owner, emailed me that ConneVity (and I paraphrase) ""deserves better feedback under Amazon's feedback agreement and Amazon expects me to remove or edit my feedback.""  Amazon confirmed there is no such thing as a ""feedback agreement"" and I do not have to remove or edit anything.  In fact, the Amazon representative filed another claim with Amazon's seller investigation team because ConneVity's communications violated Amazon's community rules.ConneVity spent 3 paragraphs trying to make me feel guilty and trick me into removing my negative (but deserved) feedback.

I keep a USB cable in my laptop bag which is virtually almost with me anywhere I go. The plastic of both adapters is excellent but the USB cable felt a little bit cheap and thin that's why I use my own cable for charging. However I have tested it and it still does the job of charging the phone.One advice you may want to know, if you want to use the USB port in your computer to charge the phone, make sure it is a POWERED USB port and not a normal port.I used to know that all USB ports are powered since we can hook external hard drives (without power adapters) and they work by drawing power from USB. But when i used it to charge my phone at work, the battery indicator never went up it actually remained as it is for the whole 9 hours at work even tho I used the phone a lot. After investigating, I later discovered that in order to charge your blackberry thru a USB port, the port should be labeled POWERED as to indicate it got an extra electrical power extended into them. This is required for more demanding USB powered devices such as charging your Blackberry.However, if you use a normal USB port to plug your Blackberry, as said above, it will NOT charge the phone's battery, but in the same time the battery will hold its charge at its current level, which is EXCELLENT if you know that your battery won't survive the 9 hours at work and it only have enough charge for the trip back home from work.  This way you keep the battery level as it is and save the battery power for the trip back home :)",5.0,Excellent and a must have,1274227200,"05 19, 2010",Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,1.0

I didn't want the additional expense of a second touchstone.This product works very well.  I have been using this cable for a few days plugged into a USB port without any issues.  I have used it for all 3 options-- Media Sync, USB Drive, and Just Charge, all worked fine.I have read a number of reviews for various cables that don't work with the Touchstone; I plugged this one in to the Touchstone and it worked fine. I believe part of the issue on those is that the mini USB cable end isn't long enough to fit in the Touchstone, but I did not have any problems connecting this specific cable.If you are buying this to use with a Touchstone, keep in mind that you will need to purchase a USB outlet adapter, as well.  (The touchstone won't work with the cable plugged into a USB port; it must be plugged into an outlet.)Pros: good price, works well, works with the Touchstone, performs all required tasksCons: a bit short (about 40 inches/1 meter long); if using with a Touchstone you must also purchase the USB outlet adapter.",5.0,"Great price, works well with Pre and Touchstone",1251244800,"08 26, 2009",Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,1.0

After a moderate wait I was able to get a live support rep. We went over diagnostics, but within the first minute of the call, his question was ""How much did you pay for this product?""..When I answered $30 on Amazon.com - his response was "" Must have been refurbished! - send it back to the seller!!""....When I mentioned the description says - brand new and it arrived in new packaging his answer didn't change.At this point - it became pretty obvious that he'd lost all interest in the call and wanted to just get me off the phone...Then I asked about their product warranty - I even have a product warranty card - he said, ""call the seller first or return it to them!""....What kind or condescending product support/warranty is this - product support has no business asking about product price...I highly doubt their product warranty means anything to them or - or even if they will stand behind it.Their product support and brand standards are probably just like their product - substandard and indifferentUnfortunately I can't give them less than 1 star",1.0,Substandard Snooty Product support = Buyer Beware,1244764800,"06 12, 2009",Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,0.0

Then, plug it into the phone (preferably with the phone turned off) and wait up to 3 minutes until the light goes on again to indicate it is done charging.

It's easy enough to use, however it requires an included adapter to fit the G' zOne (or any other phone), and that is where the problem is. Being a car charger, just the movement of the car while driving causes it to lose it's connection to charge the phone. The wire doesn't come apart from the phone itself or from the adapter piece, it just loses it's connection at it's little adapter and the charge light goes off and the phone doesn't charge, even though you've connected it and all the while you think it's being charged. Very annoying. The slightest movement and the connection is compromised. Twisting the little connector or even touching the phone will get it charging again, then a minute later the connection is lost and the charge light is off again. Way too sensitive a connection. I bought this in August and it's now November and I would definitely NOT buy this again. It's cheap for a reason. About the only thing good (to date) I can offer is the wire retractor still works. Look elsewhere.Update: This ""Professional Retractable Car Charger for LG G'zOne"" has been disposed of.

Unfortunately I now have come to learn that orders received by 10 a.m. ship within 2 days or so and overnight actually means 1-2 days. The acceptable thing to do here is reduce the shipping charge to express rate and after that correct your advertisement copy to clearly explain your interpretation of of the term ""overnight"". The honorable thing to do would be to reduce the charge to your standard rate, apologize for the inconvenience.You can imaginewhat didn't happen? Their answer:If an order is placed on Tuesday for instance, and one day is paid, itis guaranteed to go out by Thursday and will arrive in one day from theshipment date.  99% of the time it goes out within 24 hours, as is thecase with yours.

I received this charger quickly (only four days) but when I opened it this was simply a charger with a micro-USB plug on the end. This does absolutely NO GOOD for the S305. The plug on the S305 is NOT a micro-USB, it is a more specialized shape. I'm sure that all of the contacts and charging power would work just fine, but when you can't physically connect it that doesn't really help. Stay away from this. I tried to call the company about returning it and they would simply put me on hold. Frustrated to have wasted money on this. Don't do the same.",1.0,STAY AWAY FROM THIS!!,1298505600,"02 24, 2011",Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,0.0
