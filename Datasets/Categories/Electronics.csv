The actual function of this CLIKR-5 is OK, but the ergonomic design sets back remotes by 20 years.  The buttons are all the same, there's no separation of the number buttons, the volume and channel buttons are the same shape as the other buttons on the remote, and it all adds up to a crappy user experience.  Why would TWC accept this as a replacement?  This remote is virtually impossible to pick up and use without staring at it to make sure where your fingers are.  Heck, you have to feel around just to figure out if you've grabbed it by the top or bottom, since there's no articulation in the body of the thing to tell you which end is up.

Rand McNally, are you listening?First thing I did after charging it was connect it to my laptop and install the software and then attempt to update it.  The software detected a problem with my update and wanted my home address so I could be sent a patch on an SD card.  Hello?  I don't think I'm all that unusual; my home address is a PO box that a friend checks weekly and that I might get to check every six months or so.  I live in my truck and at truck stops.  If you need to make a patch available on an SD card then you should send the SD cards to the truck stops where the devices are sold.  I ran the update program multiple times until the program said that the TND 700 was completely updated.I programmed in the height (13'6""), the length (53') and the weight (80,000#) of my rig and told it that I preferred highways.  I was parked at a truck stop in the Cincinnati OH area.  My next pickup was about 15 miles down the same freeway but on the other side of it a couple of blocks.  My cell phone GPS (Sprint) said to get on the freeway to get to my pickup.  The TND 700 routed me thru 23 miles of residential streets before finally getting me to my pickup.  Very exciting, especially since every time I refused to turn down a street posted ""No Trucks"" the TND 700 took almost 5 minutes to figure a re-route, and it happened multiple times on that short trip.I decided to give it another chance.  After my pickup on the north side of Cincinnati just off of I-75 I needed to head to Phoenix AZ via I-71.  Easy route is to just hop on I-75 and drive west and south to the intersection of I-71.  Indeed, that is what my cell phone advised.  The TND 700, however, wanted to route me over surface streets across the city and pick up I-75 on the other side of the city.  I turned it off and the next time I passed a truck stop of the same chain I purchased it at I returned it and got my money back.I then spent $30 on a cheap printer.  Now I take a minute to set up my route on Google and print it out.  Hasn't gotten me lost yet over several cross country trips.",1.0,Very Disappointed,1290643200,"11 25, 2010",Electronics,0.0

I've tried others and nothing seems to come close to the Rand McNally TND-700.Excellent screen size and resolution. The audio is loud enough to be heard over road noise and the purr of my Kenworth/Cat engine. I've used it for the last 8,000 miles or so and it has only glitched once. Just restarted it and it picked up on my route right where it should have. The exit lane screen has been spot on every time and gives me plenty of time to get my rig into the appropriate lane safely. I also love the multi-stop route planning and use it a lot. Updated regularly, it has shown me all the construction zones and has a feature to allow me to detour around them. Creating Groups and storing locations in them is a breeze so I can separate warehouse from store locations, etc.I'm running an HP Pavilion laptop with Windows 7 OS for the dock and update. The USB port DOES charge the GPS, at least with my laptop, despite the warning in a previous review. Even if it didn't, the supplied 12-volt and AC chargers take care of getting the battery up to speed.My complaints are relatively minor:Battery life when it is unplugged isn't great. However, since I use it plugged in in the cab 95% of the time, it doesn't create too much of a problem.The announcement of state borders coming up is nice but it doesn't tell you (or show you on the map display) what state you are in and/or going into. Again, a minor issue because I know where I am but all my other GPS units had this feature. For $500 smackers, I don't expect this kind of slip-up.There is a Micro SD slot on the unit and I bought a card for it. Unfortunately, the manual has absolutely no information on using it. The only reference is on the page showing the physical features of the unit, showing the position of the slot.

{'$oid': '5a13242d741a2384e88f3c1f'},A3N7T0DY83Y4IG,0528881469,C. A. Freeman,"[43, 45]","Well, what can I say.  I've had this unit in my truck for about four days now.  Prior to that I had a Garmin 755T non-truck GPS.  One of my favorite features in that unit was the ability to plan a route by determining mileage using the stop or via feature.  What I would do is using a map I would route myself several different ways forcing the unit by putting in stops or vias at different locations along the route, otherwise, like most GPS 's, it determines what it thinks is the best route.  I could add up to 10 Via's or stop points for each route and then based on mileage and other factors determine which is the best route to take.  Multiple stops and the ability to route was the most important reason for having the Garmin.  However it was not truck specific.  And considering I am now hauling strictly hazmat I wanted something that would take that into consideration.  After perusing various forums, review sites, and word-of-mouth my choices boiled down to the Garmin 465T or the RAND McNally Intelliroute TND 700.  Even though it was quite a bit more than the Garmin I chose the TND 700 for several reasons.  The main one being the extra screen size, and its ability to coordinate with the RAND McNally truck atlas and also its ease of updating.Now on to my first impression of the TND 700.  It seems to be an aesthetically pleasing and durably built unit.  The first thing I noticed was it's very slow to boot compared to my old Garmin.  Whether this is unique to the TND 700 or is common amongst all truck specific gps units I cannot tell, but it's really not that big of a deal.  The second thing I noticed was the overwhelming wealth of information put forth.  That might explain why the manual (available via the TND dock) is well over 100 pages long.....  There is somewhat of a learning curve with this unit.  The next thing I noticed was the complexity of entering routes.  As previously mentioned I like to force it into my preferred routing by the use of stops or vias.  That was a big no go with this unit.  While you can enter multiple stops or vias it is nowhere near as user-friendly as my old Garmin.  Furthermore there is no way you can determine total mileage on the route that you have chosen, as I could with the Garmin.  Totally flummoxed by what appeared to be an omission of one of the best routing tools a trucker could have I went online and verified through an expert source connected with RAND McNally that no, that feature was a couple updates down the line and was not available at this point.  Unbelievable.  Also forcing the unit to follow a specific route can be very challenging.  For a unit of this price, and feature laden, I find this totally unacceptable.  I am still mulling over selling this unit  and buying the Garmin 465T.  I really do like this GPS, the screen is magnificent, and the volume is awesome.Another thing I've noticed, which I do not think is unique to this unit, is some of the weird routing that it does.  I've never owned a truck specific GPS before but after playing with this one for a couple of days I get the impression that what RAND MacNally (and the others that use Navteq) has done is take a plain old car specific Navteq map and a road atlas with truck restrictions and made notifications on the map.  In most databases there is not a 100% thorough listing of every road in the country.  What I mean is that this unit will route you down roads you don't belong on.  Today while coming home it tried routing me on several  9 ton County roads.  What that means is that a truck is limited to 73280 unless the road is posted at 10 tons.  County roads do not have that restriction listed in the RAND McNally road atlas, so I believe that is why it is not listed.....  Also unacceptable in a unit of this price and sold as truck specific.  However I'd be willing to bet the other truck specific units are the same way as no one has ever done a truck specific version of NavTeq.Another bone I have to pick is the POI's. Not only the truck specific ones but the others all seem to be somewhat outdated.  I think the Garmin, at least the ones that I have used, are more current.  It would also be nice if I could add my own POI'sTo sum it up I will keep this unit a little longer to see if I can make it workable.  If not I will go back to Garmin.  I like the concept and I like the unit but at this point I'll have to say I am somewhat unimpressed.pros:Large screenterrific imagesoutstanding volumecons:inability to determine route mileage by multiple stops and viasa somewhat outdated POI information.Non-truck specific routings.Cost.",3.0,1st impression,1283990400,"09 9, 2010",Electronics,0.0

After reading on forums and contacting Rand McNally, I have learned that Windows 7 does not send enough power to the USB ports to allow the TND 700 to go into ""connected"" mode when it's plugged in to a computer.  Supposedly this is a problem that occurs mostly with laptops and some Dell systems (""Dell Latitude or Inspiron PC (it may occur on other models as well)"").  Rand McNally send a very helpful email with some solutions to the problem, though it sounds like they are still unsure of all fixes or what causes the problem.

I've driven well over 1-mil miles and done most of my own routing so I pretty know whats the fastest and shortest. Have been using a basic garmin for the past three years and with ANY Gps unit they'll ALL get you in trouble if you let them. I was really excited about this unit, due to the size and the features. Allot of great grafics and on screen info thats usefull. But the most basic item that it was lacking was the gps tracking. I gave this unit allot of leadway on its mistakes due to the fact that it had allot of cool stuff that it did, but its ability to track you and route you was not even close to what the basic garmin could due. Its like the prossesor that they installed in the TND 700 was 10 years old. Example if I needed to make a simple route change I.E. in town down to the next street due to the fact that I couldn't make the turn or the street was blocked off, it would take the TND 700 upwards of 45 seconds to a minute and a half to reroute me. Here I'm sitting at a stop light waiting for directions and waiting that long with cars on my backside didn't make me happy. This is a problem that happened evertime you had to reroute, weather it was a simple street change or a major highway change. Also from the time you turned the unit on it would take twice as long to boot itself up. At least a dozen times with in a week it put me on the wrong roads and when I made a wrong turn it got it self lost....I.E. take left on xyz street, and it was some ones drive way. Or turn left in 800 yards and the turn was less than 10 feet away. You might think in a conjested city situation I might get a little mixed up, but this is out in the country. Twice it put me under 12'6"" bridges when I'm 13'6"". Of course I made sure all my truck setting where they were supposed to be. I also updated the OS version,via Rand McNally. All in all I expected alot out of this unit and got a unit that should of been field tested with some people that drive allot. It just had to many route mistakes. Going back to the basic garmin.

Has better graphics than Cobra 7"".  It does have lane assist which is important when in large metro areas and need to be in correct lane for exits, etc Atlanta, GA.  I have read some of the negative comments written earlier and I do not have those problems.  Sure, sometimes it does not give the fastest or the simplest route but it has never sent me down a non truck route like all the prior gps i have had in the past.  I am a car carrier so I set truck size at 13' 8"" and it has kept me from going down roads with 13'6"" bridges.  The only negative comment I have is that it constantly changes map views from city to county to state way to often.  Other than this, I love the fact that:  1) it shows mileage to destination, arrival time (which you can change to time left),  2) shows the city, county and state you are current located (how often we truck drivers pull over at a rest area or truck stop and wonder what city we are located).  3) large 7"" color screen for easy viewing and screen changes automatically for night time driving  4) list truck poi and non truck poi (wish Rand McNally had a feature that would let us send them an update for poi, maybe when we get at a Loves that use to be a Pilot, just tap on the screen and edit info, then when I connect gps to computer for weekly update the map will get updated.  5) able to update construction info by linking gps to computer and get updates given to Rand McNally by the states.  Unfortunately like usual  the states are mostly behind on updates given to Rand McNally.  This is where we the consumer should have the ability to tap screen and make corrections and send it to Rand McNally.  Many times I have gone into areas that it said ""Construction Ahead"" and no construction is being done because it has been completed.  6)  speed limits of highways and Interstates and shows your current speed just below it (also shows truck speed limits in red) Still the states have to report these limits to Rand McNally and as usual they are slow on reporting.  But still most of the time 95% it is correct.  7)  great truckers tools like driving hours left.  It automatically changes to driving when truck has moved for more than 1 mile and changes to off duty if it is idle for 15 minutes.  It lets you know when you have 1 hour left to drive and that driving time has expired. You reset every day manually.  Also have total hours worked for day and hours left to work for the week. You will have to manually override this sometimes because it doesn't distinguish off duty and on duty hours well, you have to manually tell it you are on duty.  I just manually configure at the end of the day.  The important one is driving hours and end of the week hours.  8)  service reminders for your perimeters you set, such as 8000 and 16000 services.  You reset manually when completed.  9)  able to set many multiple stops set and ability to add more stops in route  10) loud enough to hear spoken text to speech street names over engine noise (and believe me my truck is loud)  11) ability to save your own poi (I do it all the time)  12) it tells you when you are 3 miles from approaching a weight station (you can configure it up to 5 miles)  13) it tells you when you are 1 mile from state border and tells you when you cross border and what state you are in.  14) it tells you all mileage you driven that day and mileage by state and mileage by day.  saves info for 1 year.  Overall, this is definitely a truckers friend and I absolutely love this GPS.  A definite must buy.",5.0,Excellent buy,1293235200,"12 25, 2010",Electronics,1.0

There were a few times that it routed me thru some residential areas and a couple of times I wondered if a truck was even legal at all. I loved the feature where I could see if there was a truck stop or rest area close by though it does not have them all. My main concern or problem with this device is in the charging port. The unit get to hot at this port. I went thru 3 12vlt chargers and 1 house wall charger. eventually the plug in had got to the point of being brittle and fell apart. I talk to Rand McNally about this they sent me 1 12 volt charger. But I had to pay for the rest and if I wanted them to look at it I would have to pay shipping out of my pocket. I have a problem with that because I paid so much for it to start. I had it about 2 mos. when it started having problems. I had it 10 mos. when it finally became useless and I thrrew it away.

It's pretty clear and seems tough enough not to need a screen protector. The plastic that was on the screen out-of-the-box left glue residue which was a pain to remove. It comes with a stylus that works great but navigating around with your finger is easy and works just fine. I usually just have to tap it with the back of my finger. When you get it, charge it for a few hours before you use it at all. I'm not sure if my over sized good laptop even was charging it. So use the wall outlet. It comes with nice cables for both wall outlet and 12 volt, as well as a good usb cable. The supplied mount is excellent and easy to use. No tools required. The screen part snaps into another flat part on the mount and you have to make sure it's clicked in all the way or it will drop out.. AFTER IT IS FULLY CHARGED, plug it in the pc and get your first free lifetime update. The software loads fine and tries to start up each time you use the computer. I stopped that and made a shortcut to start it myself. There are no options I saw to disable it from auto starting... I used ccleaner/tools/startup to disable it. The program DOES use a lot of resources when running, but you only need to update once in a while.My first drive with it was Tampa to El Paso. It saves my height, width, weight and hazmat class. I was hauling hazmat. It gave a killer route that would have saved time but I had to alter it for the company fuel stops and routes. It tells you everything you need to know. Where travel centers are and what they have, scales and weigh stations and much more which can all be symbols on the map if you wish. YAY now i don't have to buy an iphone. Some stuff in the manual says parts are for future use so I'm guessing the updates are going to give even more. You can manually adjust the zoom. The automatic screen zooming works great. One time it was dark and cloudy with a cool looking sky and I looked at my screen and saw the exact same thing as I approached a ramp. You can save all your addresses and stops and put notes in them for phone numbers and gate codes etc. Then make groups (folders) for your addresses so you can find them even quicker. I sat there for 9 hours like a jerk and typed in all the company terminals and drop yards. It was fun. I'm saving each new stop now with notes too.Once the GPS kinda got confused and mixed up my current rout with a completed one. It may have been my fault but I don't think so. I just restarted it real quick and it worked fine again.I also used it in my car. It's easy to switch between truck and car mode. I drive a medium large car and the 7 inch unit was a bit to big and did obstruct my view a little.The voice is fine and easy to adjust. The thing is nice and it works good. The traffic and road updates for life. I don't have to use internet or buy a netbook (with gps) and software... I'm happy I got it. I don't get lost anymore.I like the TND 700. I'd just like to tell Rand Mcnally that since we spent as much on this as for a laptop, please make this the best and keep updates and innovations coming to us for the next few years at least. I'm kinda expecting you to make the software on the unit and on the TND DOCK (pc software) a bit better. I'd also like to be able to set up routes INTERSTATE to INTERSTATE to INTERSTATE to FINAL in order to comply with company route solutions. Sometimes we can't take all those better routes the unit suggests. You can make this worthy of five stars with just a little more effort.  Well, I gotta haul A$$.

It shows truck restricted routes where there are none (Route US2 in Vermont & Route US1 bypass in Portsmouth, NH for 2 examples). Friday 03/11/11 it told me to go South when I knew I should go North. Another very irritating feature is that the ""back"" buttons are in different places in each screen. Near Waterbury Connecticut it shows the speed as 45 mph on I84 when in reality it i55 mph.

The HCS12 is pretty easy to work with if you can keep the registers in order (in your head) It has many of the features you might need like I/O compare, ADC, Timer, (I use these the most).. The board comes with an bread board attachment which can be handy. When it came it looked brand new straight from Axion. I bought an serial to USB cable from ""plugable"" which I would recommend if your laptop does not have D9 port. I installed the Serial to USB driver. Hooked up the EVB. Installed HCS12 compiler and loader. Found the Serial Channel and loaded a program in the CD and it was running in about 15 minutes. So I know it works of of basic programs. I am looking into getting Codewarrior for HCS12. They do have code size restriuctions which I think is kind of dirty but there are ways around it. It would help programming the Chip(writing in Assembly is hell). Make sure you read the data sheet of freescale to see if the chip works for your needs.

No problem with the Blue Logger GPS but my complaints are as follows:1. Delorme did not include the Blue Logger Manager software on the HH. Now they want to sell it separately for additional $39. Very Weird marketing strategy indeed.2. The software for the pocket PC is very difficult to use, not very intuitive. It seems the hand held software was developed as an afterthought from the software for the pc. It is poorly designed, and appeared was not fully tested by normal users prior to releasing to market.3. It is very cumbersome and slow to determine a route. Even with a 620 MHz Axim, it is slow. Worse yet, the route is often wrong. FOr example, this afternoon I use SA2005 to determine a route to a friend's house. Had I followed that route, I would come to a dead end street and have to back track about 10 miles to get to another correct route to my destination. Luckily, I decided to use my paper map. Later, I tried Microsoft Mapping on the internet and it actually gave me the correct routing. Last week for another location, SA2005 found the wrong location for a given address which would take me about 4 miles off. Luckily, I knew where it was and ignored the routing from SA2005 HH.4. Many other mapping softwares for HH will allow one to use it with 1 hand and often with the finger. But not with SA2005 HH. After 2 weeks of using it, I found myself going back to my old paper map. For example, if I had not calculated a route and just simply use the GPS and map to travel, the software only show the street I was on but no name given and no street name shown for upcoming cross streets. It does not help when you are lost.5. SA2005 maps seems to be several years old and not very up to date. I guess that's why Delorme does not want to clearly advertise this issue.I am seriously considering giving up SA2005 and consider this as my $50 learning mistake, and looking at Microsoft Street & Trip 2005 or later in 1Q 2005, IGuidance who is supposed to have the latest map.I am not alone in this as several other users have also complained on delorme user forum.

Bailey ""cbailey139""","[0, 0]","I have bought several Blue Loggers along with some other hardware and software, notably GPS PostPro, DeLorme's software that will postprocess GPS data to make more accurate positional measurements.The point of postprocessing is to use data acquired over minutes or hours, for example by the Blue Logger, and do calculations after the fact comparing these data to data logged at fixed GPS observing stations around the USA or world. You can measure a point to a few inches, when things go well.If you spend thousands of dollars you can get a nice GPS receiver and software for doing this, like surveyors do. The Blue Logger and PostPro let you do the same thing, though not quite as precisely, for a few hundred dollars. You can't use just any GPS receiver - it has to record information separately for every GPS satellite.So, the Blue Logger is the only product out there that can do this unless you spend thousands.On the plus side is the fact that this is even possible. And, the Logger feels like a nice solid little device.On the minus side, though, Blue Loggers just barely work. They're probably the most unreliable and difficult electronic product I've ever tried to use. They keep malfunctioning. To make matters worse, I bet other companies that might have tried to put similar products out there would not want to now, because these things are convincing consumers that postprocessing is difficult.I keep using them because I really want the results, but I curse their unreliability every time I do. And this would have been such a perfect product, if they'd made them work right.I gave them a moderate rating because it's great that there is any product out there at all for doing this. If there were competing products I'd have to give Blue Loggers a thumbs down completely.If you want to see bright people struggling bravely with a cursed and evil product, go look at the Blue Logger Receiver forum at delorme.com.",3.0,Allows postprocessing to get submeter accuracy,1204848000,"03 7, 2008",Electronics,0.0

It seemed sturdy, but I can see where some of the complaints about the easiness of the extending the arms and also installation can be justified complaints.

I unpacked the mount to put up a new flat panel TV in my bedroom and it took me about 20 minutes from unpacking to secure the mount to the wall (another 40 minutes to mount the TV). You'll need some hand tools like a drill with drill bits to drill holes in your wall and a socket wrench to secure the bolts to the wall. Having a second person help you hold the mount while you screw it to the wall is very helpful since the mount is heavy and your arms get tired holding it over your head. You should also spray some WD40 to lubricate the joints prior to mounting it to the wall so the arm swings easily. You will also need a stud finder to attach the mount to wooden studs in the wall. Having the other person hold the TV while you screw in the four screws to the TV mounting plate is a must.

It seems to handle the weight fine and was a snap to install.  I especially like the mount cover that hides the bolt heads.  Before I bought this item, I read most of the reviews here.  I thought I would address some of the negatives I read and have now experienced.  One review talked about how tight the mount was to move.  There is a simple answer to that...loosen the bolts on those joints!  Others mentioned how it was a two person job to mount.  While it might take two people to figure out where to mount it, I mounted this in an RV six feet high by myself.  Just take the bolts off of the bracket with the included wrench, mount it, then put the bracket back on.  I also read that the TV was hard to put on once the mount was on the wall.  There is a top screw on the middle joint that can be removed.  Then mount the bracket to the TV.  Then put the middle section back together by simply sliding it onto the post it came off of.  I don't travel with the TV mounted in the RV so I take it off and put it on this same way and never struggle at all.  Another review talked about the mount being out of square with the TV.  This mount is endlessly adjustable and the tilt and pitch both of the TV can be adjusted.  All in all this is a solid mount with endless adjustments.  It even includes a small loop to help with cable management.  For the money, I can't believe there is something out there better.

I was buying this as a replacement mount since I was moving the TV into the bedroom and needed a tilting mount. Possibly shame on me for having a generic made tv and not knowing the exact VESA mounting pattern but I have used the same TV with another universal mount with no issues. Problem was that where my mounting holes in the TV were, I would have almost had to drill a home made hole in the metal to accomodate the tv.  I needed a hole exactly in the middle of where the mount curves inward.If this mount would have worked, I would have given it 4 stars.  Seems to be reasonably well made for the price with a heavy metal. Definitely much better quality from the speaker mounts I bought from the same manufacturer.  The only negative I saw what the tilt motion.  Instructions make it seem like the tilt is accomplished where the tv meets the mount.  This is in fact not true.  You have to loosen a bolt near where the mount holds to the wall and position the mount up and down on a curved insert.  So if installing, be aware that if you need the tilt to arrange it before you mount.If I were actually able to make it as far as mounting to the wall, then that would have been easy.

I installed it in less than 1/2 hour and am very happy with the results.PROS:-Comes with all of the hardware you'll need-Comes with some extra hardware of which I have NO IDEA what it is there for.  I suspect it's a 'universal' hardware pack for several models and not all hardware is used for all models, but it's nice to have a little 'extra' (which is always better than not enough!)-The included Level is nice... well it's cheap but it works!-The instructions did a decent enough job of explaining how to install the unit.CONS:-Metal is just a tad on the flimsy side.  I have no problems trusting it with my &lt;30lb television but if I were to mount something closer to its maximum rated weight of 55lbs, I think I would be quite a bit nervous about it holding up.-The holes in the base were just a little bit too wide for my wall stud.  I think the particular stud I was installing it onto was a typical 2X4 and if centered, the left and right side holes were just a little too far to grab both sides of the stud.  I had to reposition it so that the center holes were aligned to the left side of the stud, and that the right side holes were aligned to the right side of the stud.  As a result, I was only able to install four of the six bolts to hold it in place, but I don't feel it will be an issue with my 28LB television.  If your house uses wider studs this probably wouldn't even be an issue.-The metal does sag just a little bit with the weight of the television on it.  I mounted the base just a little bit ""off level"" to help compensate for this, and had no problems getting the television level using the adjustments available to me.CONCLUSION:  All in all It's not a bad unit.. ESPECIALLY for the price.  Yes I would have liked to see a sturdier unit, but when you take into account the &lt;$30 price tag, it's an excellent bargain.  I don't think I'll have any issue with a static mounting of my TV in the corner of the bedroom *BUT* if you are considering installing this unit for a television that will see a lot of traffic, constant repositioning, etc... then you might want to spend more money on something sturdier.",4.0,It works!,1306800000,"05 31, 2011",Electronics,1.0

There was no stud near where I needed to mount the bracket for the TV mount, so I used four toggler bolts, which was probably overkill.  The TV itself easily mounted to the wall bracket with hardware provided.  TV was on the wall and in use in less than 30 minutes.  Really like the 15 degree angle, which works great in a bedroom.  For the price you can't beat this mount.  Although I will probably never use the articulating arm, it is great for adding/moving cables from behind the TV by simply pulling it away from the wall.  Would highly recommend.",5.0,Great TV Mount,1319155200,"10 21, 2011",Electronics,1.0

Because I have used many arms for a majority of all my TV's, I can safely say this was a standard and sturdy easy to install arm. I would not use this arm for a 55&#34; TV even though it says it can accomodate it. The reason for this is because you cannot compensate for the inevitable sag or pull on the metal components.

The instructions do not indicate this, but I removed the TV plate and the wall bracket from the arms to facilitate installation.  My LG set has a 200mm x 100mm mount pattern.  The M4 screws are the correct choice for my application, but I needed washers to prevent the screw heads from passing through the large holes in the plate.  There are some spacers/washers included in the hardware pack, but I decided to pick up 4 fender washers and used those instead.  After I got the plate mounted to the TV and the wall bracket mounted, I reattached the arms to the TV bracket and re-installed the bolt I removed earlier.  I had a helper install the bolt attaching the arm to the wall plate while I held onto the TV.  Once I got everything tightened up, I was a bit concerned that the set was crooked even though I installed the wall bracket level and plum.

Amazingly, this kit comes with brackets-extenders if you need for weird TV form factors. The construction is very sturdy and there is no gaps in the joints. The TV can be turned and moved to any direction without skewing or loss of horizontal. Because of the extended arm it has another great potential by attaching your great old speakers to the back of the TV holding brackets. This might save you $500 - $1,000 on a Sound Bar.",5.0,Great for unusual projects,1387670400,"12 22, 2013",Electronics,1.0

This arm comes with all needed mounting hardware for either masonry or wall stud mounting as well as a set of 4 screws for several sizes of panel mounting screws.  It also comes with a small wrench for two different sizes of hex heads on the arm and an allen wrench for one of the arm adjustments.  It is at least a two man operation to attach the flat screen after the arm is attached to the wall.  I mounted mine on a stud in the wall.  For stud mounting you use two of the six mounting hex head lag screws that come with it.  It doesn't say exactly in the directions but you should use a 1/4"" drill bit to pre-drill the holes in the stud.  I would not recommend trying to use the included hex wrench to tighten down the wall mounting lag screws, you need more leverage to tighten it than it provides; use a crescent wrench or other longer hex wrench.  I used a stud finder to locate the studs accurately.  Make sure you do not have obvious pipes or electrical going through the wall at the chosen location.  They can throw off some stud finders.  If you want to quickly adjust one of the arm adjustment screws it also contains a replacement screw that has a slip bar top lever so that it can be loosened and tightened without a wrench.  There is one optional cable management loop that attaches to the bottom of the middle of the arm.  It could use one more at the wall, but that is easy to improvise.

The bedroom TV is a 35"" LCD, and the TV in the living room is a 55"" LED.  (Surprisingly enough, they both weigh 50 pounds...)  This mount works very well for both of them.  It's relatively simple to install - you just need to find a stud and screw the support in to it.  (I will admit that my bedroom TV has been attached not to a wall stud, but a jury-rigged support brace on a cabinet.  It's still there and attached after 6 months.)I will say that the joints in the arms are quite stiff - it can take a little muscle to move the TV.  But I think I prefer that - it certainly doesn't feel flimsy, and it stays wherever I put it.A tip for would-be purchasers: make sure your TV supports this mount.

There are two ""tools"" provided. One is a hex key and it works. The other in a small box wrench. Throw the box wrench away as it is at least 1mm larger than the lags bolts provided and thus slips when used, could cause minor injury, and is totally useless. BTW, the pre- mounted bolts, as shipped, are torqued on tightly, watch the fingers and hands so as not to mash them once the torque pressure is released as you untighten them.  I strongly suggest using your own tools. Either a racket wrench or correct size box wrench. The lag bolts provided for mounting are large and should be mounted in a wall stud 2x4. To prevent splitting the stud, drill progressively larger pilot holes until you acheive the size correct for the mounting the lag bolts. The instructions are minimal and vague. For instance, there is a small component provided which looks like a screw cap with a small barbell thru the top.  Interesting, but here is no explanation what it is for. Also the mounting lag bolts should be six in number; only five were included in my shipment, so I winged it with a lag bolt of my own.  Mounting the TV to the TV plate has to be somewhat intuitive; screws are provided for most configurations.

I researched a number of articulating arms and selected this one because of the reviews and the length of the arm itself.As other reviews have noted, the product is constructed of solid materials.  While heavy, it was easily installed by my organization's maintenance staff.  One downside to this product is that while the arm length and location is fairly easy to adjust, I have not been able to easily adjust the pitch of the monitor (angle of the monitor face relative to the ground).  Thankfully when installed it was at an appropriate level for my use and is not a big issue. Another very slight issue is that the arm has the slightest wiggle to it, so that, when the arm is fully extended the monitor is slightly off level.  This may be more an issue of installation than product, however.On the whole, I'm very pleased with the product, particularly at the price that I paid for it.",4.0,"Installed in ""Mobile"" Office",1351555200,"10 30, 2012",Electronics,1.0

That is where I the eldest son came into the picture(pun intended).I knew in advance the location had plywood backing behind the drywall, which meant this mount would be easy to install as wood screws would be secure anywhere on the wall. But what if it was a typical installation, would there be a stud in the wall centered where needed to hold the tv and mount securely? It seems unlikely most people would, so what are the options?Option #1. Buy a different mount with a mounting plate rather than small 2 hole bracket as on this model. If you don't know what I am talking about, look at other tv wall mounts and you will see on many of these a large wall plate that can easily cover an area with at least one stud, and addtionally allow drywall anchors elsewhere on the plate to handle the weight of any tv. This model has only a small wall bracket with holes for 2 screws or anchors.Option #2. Use wall anchors. Again, there are only 2 holes in this bracket so take into account the weight of the tv and the rating of the anchors. Proceed at your own risk.Option #3. Install a stud. You're on your own with this...The mount is well made, everything fits and it looks good but as mentioned, a little homework will save you time and make installation easy.I hope this review is useful. :-)",4.0,"Well made, Excellent Value",1363305600,"03 15, 2013",Electronics,1.0

Given that this mount can support almost twice the weight of my TV, it was a little bit of overkill but better safe than sorry.  The unit is already assembled right out of the box and just needs to be attached to the TV and a wall stud.  I made a quick template by rubbing a blank piece of paper on top of the wall bracket with a pencil. I then used a stud finder to locate the nearest studs where I wanted the TV to be and taped the template to the wall.  I used a drill driver to make pilot holes for the lag screws which helps greatly with getting them in.  I was able to use four of the lag screws.  There is a plastic two piece lag screw cover (included) that clicks together easily over the lag screw heads to make for a clean look.  The wall bracket allows for different screw patterns for easier installation.  Once I had the mount secured to the wall, it was time to attach the TV to its bracket.  This took two of us to do it quickly.  One lifted the TV and the other pressed the bracket flush against the TV and hand tightened the four screws that go into the back of it. This allowed the TV to be supported easier while a screwdriver was used to finish tightening the four screws.  After that, it was just a matter of adjusting the angle of the mount for the best TV viewing.This thing works as advertised.  The extension arm works smoothly and without much effort.  The tilt function has a nut that loosens to allow for pivot adjustments.  The cord management system works well to bundle the various cables and makes for a clean look.

Why pay more for something that you will not see and does the same job as other high priced mounts. The only thing I did not like was the way the instructions have you mount the TV after the bracket is attached to the wall but like another reviewer stated, I removed the head from the arm, attached it to the TV and then reattached the head to the arm and slid the bolt that I removed back in. I did reverse the orientation of the bolt by having it drop in instead of pushing it in from the bottom. It made it much easier.

I mounted it on a wall and intended to use it extended to 180 degrees. At the 180 degree extension, there is very noticeable tilt, which gets worse each day, until the TV is tilting sort of comically. If you are just using it to watch a TV &#34;head-on&#34; the tilt probably won't matter to you, but if you are using it at any sort of angle for a large TV you will have the tilt problem. The arm is simply not designed properly to handle the 180 degree extension.Also, if you are new to this TV mount thing, note that this VESA 400 compatible mount will not necessarily work for your VESA 400 compatible TV. I discovered that not all VESA 400 mounts work with all VESA 400 TVs. I had to &#34;improvise&#34; to get this mount to work and could not use any of the mounting configurations in the instruction booklet. This problem had no bearing on the &#34;tilt&#34; problem described above. I don't really understand what the point is of listing VESA compatibility when it doesn't seem to actually indicate compatibility, but there must be some tech guru who has a complex and useless explanation for it somewhere.Otherwise, the installation was fairly easy.

Let me start off by saying it works as advertised.  But that won't get you 5 stars.  The problem is installation.  Maybe it's my own fault for thinking all TV wall mounts worked like the Peerless I had.  See, that one has a separate TV plate that you screw to the TV first.  Then you have the second piece (the actual wall mount) that you screw to the wall.  Once that's done, using the bracket mounted on the TV, you hang the TV on the wall mount and secure it with a single bolt.  One person can easily put a TV on the wall.Not so much with this one.  Yes, I will admit that once it's mounted, it's a more secure connection, but it's the mounting that's the problem.  You can't do it alone.  Depending on the weight of the TV, you will need at least one helper.  This mount is one piece, which means that you have to hold the TV to the wall-mounted plate while attaching it with screws.  That can get tricky, especially with heavier TVs (I used it for a while with my old LCD TV which weighs 40+ pounds).  They do get kudos for providing all the screws for all VESA types as well as a regular and an Allen wrench.Three stars for ease of installation, five stars for usability, for a combined four stars.

Polk recommends these speakers be mounted at least 2' off the wall to keep from muffling the rear facing bass port and this mount fits the bill to a T for a heck of a lot less expense than the typical center channel speaker stands sell for ... Bonus!BTW, these Polk Monitor 40s are essentially the same speaker as their purpose built center channel speakers for 1/2 the price as I got a pair of 'em for what Polk sells single center channel speakers, and .... got a 2nd one to use for the center channel for my BR system in the process. So long as you don't mind either standing them up as intended or that the Polk emblem ends up sideways when you lay 'em on their sides like I did, they make a great center channel speaker for a bargain price.This did require some inventive modifying with my die grinder and a cut off wheel to cut away most of the mounting pad intended for attaching to various monitors/Tvs, then a lil touch up painting after the cutting but what I ended up with was just what I needed. The cable management already in place works just as well for speaker wire as it would have for an HDMI or similar video cable too.Yeah, these are of Chinese manufacture, but I was unable to find a similar American made product, and let me assure you, I did try.

So, for this VideSecu mount, inspite of poor installation instructions, I carfeully measured all domensions to fit my new 32"" Samsung LED SmartTV in a limited kitchen space. My mistake was, based on the diagrams, I assumed that the length of both the swinging arms of the mount (the single and the double arms) were of the same length. What a disaster! After installing the mount when I mounted the TV and folded the arms the TV did not center itself to the wall side of the mount! It was then that I noticed the inner length of the 2 arms is about 4"" longer than the outer single arm. In other words once the arms on the mount were fully folded in towards the wall my TV was not centered in the limited space that I had and looked awful. I don't know why the manufacturer did not keep both arms the same length. At least they shd have mentioned it in the instructions.This to me is a major product defect.

The included instructions were well written, detailed and describe the mounting process in step by step fashion.

I used the mount on an older 42 inch plasma that weighs 60 lbs, so it will handle its rated weight, assuming both mounting bolts of the wall plate are properly secured in studs.  I have observed no ""sagging,"" but I would say the arm ""flexes""  about 1 inch with my 60 lb TV attached and the arm fully extended.

It mounted to the wall with no real problem, but since it is all one unit, you have to put the whole thing up, and then raise the TV up in the air, while you line up the screw holes in the plate with the holes in the TV back and get the screws started.  This is at least a two man operation, and our TV was small.  I cannot imagine doing this with a 32"" TV.  With the four screws in place and the TV up in the air, we started connecting the wires only to discover the cable connection was covered by the mounting plate.  Brought the assistant back, removed the TV from the mount, had to disassemble the mount to get the mounting plate off, then take a hacksaw and cut one corner off the mount plate to uncover the cable connection on the back of the TV when the plate is in place, and then put it all back together again.  The design of the mounting plate is such that it cannot be disconnected from the rest of the mount and then put on the back of the TV at ground level.  The plate needs to be able to be mounted on the TV back at ground level to make sure all connections for the wires are clear.

The TV is on the wall and works wonderfully.  Very solid mount and good articulation.My only comments are the cord clips included are very weak.  I will be replacing them with black cable ties.

I looked at another mount by the same company but it did not articulate so I was worried I wouldn't be able to achieve the viewing angles that I needed. So I found this one & went w/ it based on the high reviews. I could not be more pleased.1) PRICE - If you were to go to the big electronics store (BB) or the big box monster (WM) you would pay hundreds. I can't fathom those more expensive mounts doing anything that this one does not. Does it cook dinner for me? Why pay $100-$250 for a mount when you can get this one for $29.99 & oh, by the way have the confidence in 898 customer reviews averaging 4.5 stars at the time of this writing?2) FUNCTION - This mount is solid. It articulates to the left, to the right. It pans, it tilts. One small negative.....the plastic clips for routing wires are nearly useless. I took them off.3) WHATS IN THE BOX - Normally I would not comment on what an item comes with but in this case I was so impressed I felt it was worth mentioning. It comes w/ everything you need in neatly sealed and labeled plastic sleeves. It comes w/ lag bolts that everyone will use to mount to the wall stud. (mounting to a wall stud is required unless you are mounting to concrete) Then it has 9 different screw sets to mount the plate to the back of your TV. It has 2 washer sets for the mounting plate (based on if your TV has a flat or curved back). Then it has a spanner wrench for tightening the screw of the mounting plate. Then it also has 2 plastic anchors for mounting to a concrete wall. Last but not least are the VESA adaptors (which I did not need)4) WHAT YOU NEED THAT ISN'T INCLUDED -  Pencil / Level / Stud finder / Phillips screwdriver / Drill w/ a 7/32 drill bit / Socket wrench w/ a 13mm attachment.5) CONCLUSION - This is a no brainer. I have another 32"" that needs mounted. I think as soon as I click publish for this review I will be ordering another one.

The metal is indicative of much higher-priced models than the low price of this item. Once you have it mounted, it works great with a full range of motion and the tv feels very secure.The only problem I have is the installation process itself. You have to loosen all the nuts required for getting the range of motion, and it seems that the nuts were all tightened at the strongest-man-in-the-world competition. It was VERY difficult to get them to loosen initially.The other installation issue is that the extensions that are included to mount different size TVs did not align properly and the screws provided were the wrong height. The mount comes with a bunch of different screws with varying lengths and thickness, but none of them worked without modification. As a result of those two problems, I had to come up with a jury-rig solution to getting the four expansion pieces attached to our 400x400 TV (Sony Bravia). It's not a bad solution - putting the screw through one of the slats rather than an actual screw hole along with adding a couple washers to create tension with the too-long screws - but I'd rather it be truly universal as the description claims.But even with the installation difficulties, I'd still buy the product again because it's great quality for a low price.",4.0,Works great...once you go through the pain of getting it installed,1361750400,"02 25, 2013",Electronics,1.0

I have a Sanus extended articulating mount that I bought a few years ago and paid over $100 dollars for it.

Now this is based on the 23 lb TV, but I'm not experiencing this problem.  The mount has 4 pivot points and after installation, ALL need to be tightened to the point that movement is allowed with intentional moderate force.  Out of the box, this mount would have sagged like others complained, but I'm guessing its left slightly loose to help ease the installation process.I won't hesitate to buy another one in the future if the need arises.

Unfortunately, the arm was welded to the wall bracket at a slight angle, meaning that regardless of how it would mount it and the LCD would never be level.Also, the powder coating near one of the bolts had come off and I could see some rust already forming.I decided to see if the mount would be the right fit for the tv before returning, figuring I would just get a replacement and hope for the best. I'm glad I did because this led me to find two other issues.The first one I blame on the manufacturers, the second I would consider a design flaw of the LG lcd.The first issue is that the screws supplied to attach the bracket to the tv are too few and two short. The screws are only 12mm long, and would barely catch in the threads of the TV if they weren't recessed at all. Most mounting threads on lcds and plasmas are partially recessed. I stopped by my local Lowes and picked up two packs of similar screws (M4-70 or something to that affect). $0.80 a packet so not much of an expenditure, just a big hassle. I needed 20mm long screws to mount this to the tv, so a pretty fair difference over what was supplied. The manufacturer supplies several different thread and gauge options, but only one shallow length of each set.The second issue is that this universal mount covered the power and HDMI ports on the back of the 26le5300. Again, I think this is more of an issue with the tv then the mount, as they're situated rather high and central. Either way, it's something you'll want to check on your tv before ordering this product.I actually returned this and in its stead purchased a similar mount from the same company. TheVideoSecu Swing LCD Wall Mount 20 inch Extension 55 lb loading capacity for LCD TV Monitor Flat Screen VESA 75mm/100 mm 1USgets very high marks from me. It's basically the same arm with a 75x75 to 100x100 VESA head on it. This second arm did not have any of the manufacturing errors of the previous model and fit the back of my tv perfectly.I understand that it's a very affordable mount, and that most of my issues may have been resolved with a replacement. However, I just can't give this mount any higher rating than I have.",2.0,"Poor Quality Control, May Block the Ports on Your TV",1283558400,"09 4, 2010",Electronics,0.0

I have installed many different types of mounts, so I have a lot of experience with them.  The quality is decent, but there are some items of which you should be aware:* If you have a 600x400 VESA pattern mount on your TV (as I did for a 37&#34; LG), then be aware that the extension arms are &#34;maxed out&#34; at this size, which means you have zero flexibility.  Unfortunately for my TV, the center plate onto which the extension arms attach completely covered the inputs I needed to use.  This isn't completely the VideoSecu's problem, but since there is no flexibility at this size, I had to rig it together off-centered only using two screws on the bottom arms.* All of the mounts I have ever done have a tilt function, and this is by far the biggest pain I've ever dealt with.  Instead of using thumb screws, you have to use a wrench (cheap one included) to adjust the tilt.  It is much more difficult to get the TV held in place and tighten this way.* Similar to the above, the mount gives the ability to adjust leveling after it has been installed.  This is also done with a wrench, but it is a big pain and is very difficult to keep level (keeps slipping) even with a helper.* Lastly, be aware that when folded completely, the screen is not centered over the wall mount.

I previously owed the 1950's DVD box set using the Bondi software as well, and this feels more refined and faster. I've been able to easy index various contributors and articles and save them for later.The quality of the scans aren't great. In some cases there are water stains or scribbles on the pages. It's possible that was the best they had, since let's face it I doubt Hugh Hefner and company were thinking of posterity early on in the magazine's run. Printing in particularly is pretty disappointing. At the very least it would have been nice to include the option to read transcribed text like Zinio and other software offers. That said, on a computer screen everything should be fairly readable.As others have mentioned, the quality of the pictures is also an issue. In fact I was really shocked to find out this 250gb harddrive has 215gb free. You'd think with all that space they'd scan these documents in a higher resolution, or at least offer some extras like separate folders with high-rez shots of Playmates. It seems like a lost opportunity which Playboy may be kicking themselves for now. When I inquired via email on the 1960's DVD box set they immediately offered me a [...] off coupon for this set, which would indicate it isn't selling as well as they had hoped.Which is kind of sad, because for all it's faults there is a goldmine of intellectual property on this hard drive. The articles, pictures, even advertisements are great to read.

After Bondi Digital put out the great Rolling Stone magazine compendium and the first edition of the Playboy decade series (the 50's and now the 60's), it was time to get to digitizing the whole collection. Playboy is the perfect subject for the Bondi treatment on so many levels - culturally, politically, aesthetically and yes even the advertising! (we love seeing ads from the 60's for things like the AMC's Javelin car, Hai Karate aftershave and a full set of Jack Nicklaus golf clubs for $199!)It's all there, every issue from Hef's famed Marilyn Monroe debut cover to Joanna Krupa's final cover of the first decade of the new millennium. One is stuck by many things, the calibre of the photography, the nature of the political times, decades of interviews (from all the legends you know, Norman Mailer to Woody Allen, Salman Rushdie to Bill Maher), even the print quality (a bit dot-screened in the early days to a much glossier look today.) Not to mention, of course, decades of beautiful babes from Anna Nicole to Pamela Anderson and virtually every Hollywood starlet of the last half century.The main thing, of course, is the functionality which through the digital domain allows the reader (viewer?) to browse every title by cover, date and decade, search for specific content (we read it for the articles, remember?) and view pages in full screen, double page and multiple levels of zoom formats. There are advanced search tools to even pare down your search across multiple parameters. One drawback: in keyword search you will be taken to the page of the word but the search term is not highlighted and your computer's `find' function may not work as well (at least on the Mac version we tested.) One nice feature is that the system supposedly allows you to create reading lists so you can add articles to a list for future reference and even export the list as well, (though we weren't quite sure how you get that feature to work and found nothing mentioning it in the documentation.)If there is a negative, it is perhaps that technology has advanced past the original CD-ROM curve that this series is based on. With the touchscreen, page-flip world of today (iPad, Kindle) and the shift towards cloud computing, it is only a matter of time before a new version of these compilations are expected by consumers. With this content already now digitized, it seem that such an item should be coming down the pike in the not-too-distant future.

There have to be almost pristine copies of every issue out there so I can't see that there is much excuse for having missing pages and coffee stains etc. There is even one missing centerfold picture with a post-it note scanned with one of the 3 pages. My biggest disappointment though is that the scans of the centerfolds from the late 1980s on are so bad. They are high resolution but the colors, contrast and saturation and every other setting is so far off they practically don't look like the published photos at all. This especially inexcusable since I suspect that these images were not scanned from the printed pages but from the original photo positives or negatives.

It was OK, but the included book and reprint of the 1st issue were great.  When they announced the Hard Drive, I decided to treat myself for Xmas, and got it.1st off, it's a fairly classy looking little drive, from an off-brand company - so durability is iffy.  Bondi had assured me before purchase that indeed, the drive's Playboy content could be backed-up onto another hard drive at any time, so that's a relief.  And they may or may not offer future issues to add to the collection, another iffy.But here's the kicker.  Only the actual centerfolds are truly sharp and clear!  Covers and pages suffer from all sorts of flaws and errors: missing pages and covers, poor scan quality, yellowed pages, crooked pages, and double-truck pages (that's where an image, ad, etc. spreads across both the left and right page) that don't line up.  No effort was made AT ALL to restore, align or color correct the scans.  In this day and age, this is just plain laziness and shows how far Playboy has fallen...anything for a buck, bleed the brand dry.As for the most practical application of this collection - viewing on an iPad - forget it (sort-of).  There's no app for the Bondi viewer, but you CAN export/print issues to an Adobe Acrobat .pdf file...with a catch.  The covers are scanned into the Bondi files as separate files, and the Bondi viewer assembles them into each issue.  To get complete issues as .pdf's, you'll need a version of Acrobat (or shareware) that can make single .pdf's from multiple .pdf's, save the covers and actual issue content, and assemble.  Note that there is no option to do years or decades...it's one issue at a time, baby....and that would be more than a bit time consuming.I've returned mine, and received confirmation of the refund within 48 hours of them receiving the drive.Coulda been a contender...but no cigar.",2.0,Playboy should be embarrassed.,1295913600,"01 25, 2011",Electronics,0.0

I have no more problems using the Bondi reader than I have with the reader for the New Yorker or National Geographic and the search results are compatible.

Boy was that a mistake since now I'm stuck with it or $250 in B&N credit - neither of which I want. Wish I had realized you could only purchase B&N overpriced books and apps (which are free elsewhere and very limited). This was a question we even asked at the store and the guy said all the book prices are set and the same everywhere. This is completely untrue. I tried to check out ebooks from the local library and was unable to do that either. There was this whole big process with downloading some adobe and having to put the book on a computer and then on the nook. I gave up after about 20 min of trying. Wish I would've bought the kindle fire or an ipad and simplified my life. And what happens if B&N goes out of business like Borders? Then the device is useless since it's only meant for B&N products.

Both are bargains when purchased at the discounted price Barnes & Noble provides to its members.However, they are designed for reading...if you want a gaming tablet, a Skype video tablet, or need access to thousands of apps, you need an I-Pad.I have owned a ""Brand X"" color e-reader for about a year, but seldom use it for reading because it causes eye strain. I have a Nook Simple Touch e-reader that is wonderful for books, but its e-ink screen is black on white only, which does not work well for colorful magazines such as ""Automobile"" or ""National Geographic"".Barnes & Noble has an offer that enables its members to buy the Nook tablet for MUCH less than the price quoted by internet vendors, so I took advantage of their offer...plus the staff of my neighborhood Barnes & Noble were very helpful, and invited me to classes they provide to teach new owners the in's and out's of their new tablet. Mine is the 8gb version, which works as well as the 16gb version. I added a 32gb memory card, so my Nook has more storage for books than I could ever fill.The Nook Tablet is the best of both worlds. It is easy on the eyes for long reading sessions because its screen was designed to prevent eye strain. The fonts are very clear, very sharp, and have very high contrast, enabling you to read with the screen set at a very low brightness level, eliminating eye strain. Independent tests have verified that the Nook tablet has less reflection and glare than any color e-reader or color tablet, because the screen's glass cover is bonded directly to the LCD, eliminated the air gap that causes glare.The vivid color makes magazines ""pop"" even more than their paper versions. Barnes & Noble adds a special ""text only"" option for magazine articles that make it easy to read the text by enlarging the fonts and putting the text of the article in a single long file.The Nook ""shop"" does not work as well as the Nook website on the internet for searching for specific books or categories of books. So, I downloaded the Dolphin HD browser from the Nook shop and use it to look at the Nook shop's book inventory. The Dolphin browser uses tabs, so I can put two or three books I am considering in their own tab, and switch back and forth.The Nook Tablet has Pandora Radio installed, so I can listen to my favorite music while I read books. The sound is weak through the Nook tablet's puny speaker, but wonderful through good earbuds. I also transferred about fifty of my favorite CD's to the Nook's memory card, so I can listen to music even when I am not near an internet connection.When I get tired of reading, the Nook tablet lets me watch movies and tv shows on Netflix or TV.Com. Movies on Netflix look wonderful, because the color balance on the Nook tablet is superior to that of any seven inch tablet currently available. Skin tones are difficult to get ""right"", but the Nook tablet does a great job.Many reviewers make the error of comparing the Nook Tablet to full-blown tablets, such as the Apple I-Pad. The Nook Tablet is designed to be an e-reader, and for that purpose, it is superior to any of its seven inch competition. The fact that it includes Pandora Radio and Netflix is a bonus...but it IS an e-reader. The Nook Shop has a relatively small number of apps, each of which has been tested to verify it works well with the Nook tablet's seven inch screen...most Android apps are designed for a three inch or four inch screen.The reading apps for children are impressive. Last week I downloaded a free children's book that combined the best of the ""book world"" and the ""video world"". The book played music in the background...as a character walked through a field, the flowers were swaying in the wind. The book provided an option to have a character read the book out loud, and an option to turn the voice off, so your child can read the book to herself. Many of the children's reading apps are free, or cost less than $5, a bargain compared with the $15 or $20 children's books sell for in stores.The Nook website offers a ""book of the day"" for adults and a ""book of the day"" for children. The illustrations in the children's books take advantage of the Nook's color screen. Yesterday's children's book was ""Mary Poppins"", a bargain for $2...but the REAL Mary Poppins seems a bit scary compared with the Julie Andrew's Disney version.For people who want MORE than just the world's best e-reader, Amazon.com sells a $35 SD card that converts the Nook Tablet into a conventional Android tablet with full access to Google Play and its vast array of Android apps. Just put the N2A card into the Nook's card slot, and restart the Nook. When you want to use it as just an e-reader, take the N2A card back out. Best of both worlds...the best seven inch color e-reader becomes a very good seven inch Android tablet.",5.0,The BEST Color E-Reader - With Bonus Features,1336003200,"05 3, 2012",Electronics,1.0

I did a lot of research and put a lot of thought into it, almost buying him a kindle fire because I thought it was more ""manly"" looking. After much consideration and comparison of hardware, I opted to get this one. The big selling point for me the fact that it can boot from the SD card. I have seen the N2A (Nook2Android) SD cards here on Amazon and wanted him to have that functionality but didn't want to pay that much for one, so I did some googling and figured out how to make one myself. I purchased a 16GB micro SD card and in about an hour and a half, had the thing booting to CM7 from the SD card, and now it has full tablet functionality. It runs AWESOME, super smooth and very responsive, full tablet capabilities including running 3rd party apps and access to the google play store, and all without rooting or voiding the warranty. All he has to do to put it back to stock is remove the SD card (which he never does! It is pretty much useless in its stock form unless you only do light web browsing and read ebooks) My husband LOVES it and couldn't be happier with it. He uses it every day. The only thing it doesn't have that I consider a negative is a camera. MY tablet (Acer Picasso) has a camera and I do actually use it quite a bit, but my husband says he wouldn't use one  on a tablet so it doesn't bother him anyway.

As a result, what you get is pretty limited.It's a fairly sturdy device by feel, and not difficult to hold for a while and use. The quality of the screen is pretty good and it's not difficult to read for extended periods of time (so long as you're not out in the sun anyway, almost all LCD screens perform poorly there).Very little of the space on the device is available for sideloaded content by default, so you need to use microsd cards to add more if you want to do too much with that.You can sideload content from any source that uses Adobe DRM for epubs, and also epubs that don't have DRM at all. This means that getting ebooks from the library is pretty simple. You can install an Overdrive app and do it directly without going through a computer if your library uses overdrive.You can root it to get access to more apps. If you want to run a more pure version of Android, you can go for either putting together a Cyanogenmod card yourself or purchase one already made from Nook2Android.B&N; gives away a book and an app every Friday on their blog, so that's worth checking in on regularly.On the whole, this is an okay device for reading and can be a kind of nice semi-tablet to give to someone who normally tends to load their computers/tablets up with viruses by being carelessness. It's locked-down state works in your favor from that perspective.For more general tablet use, this is a pretty poor choice. Also, as of mid-2013 the later devices (Nook HD/HD+) have been radically marked down, so if you're going to buy one of these you should look to get it pretty cheap.

My brief encounter with the actual tablet exceeded my initial expectations. However, I was told the great point of difference about the Nook versus other tablets was the customer service. Unfortunately, after having my Nook less than 24 hours, I learned of several issues. I reached out to customer service. I started with chat. After being fed automated responses that didn't answer my questions, the chat session abruptly ended after 1 hour for no reason at all. I then sent my questions via email. I was again met with automated responses. Sixteen days later and they still haven't answered any of my questions. I then called. I was told to seek out my answer via the web because they were experiencing too many calls. I opted to wait. Guess how long the wait was? About 30 seconds. This deemed promising. However, the person who took the call didn't seem to know much about the product. I finally conceded and asked to return the product. I followed their very detailed guidelines on returning a product. However, the product (which was sent via certified mail and signed for at the appropriate destination which they do not dispute) seems to have been lost in space. I have yet to receive a refund.

For those who live within 5-minutes of a Barnes and Noble, perhaps the Nook is the way to go. Overall, the tablet worked great if you recognize the memory it touts is really limited to Barnes and Noble stuff and the amount of proprietary gunk they have on the tablet limits you from using it as a true tablet. Basically, it is a hyped up version of an e-reader for those who only want to shop Barnes and Noble. This is ok, as long as you know that's what you are getting. But, for anyone who wants customer service and can't make it to a store regularly, don't count on any support. Don't count on anyone being helpful. Don't count on anyone doing anything other than sending you automated responses that may or may not address your issue. This is really too bad. But it is honest. I rarely complain about a product. But, when a company is this incompetent one must be honest. And, when a company touts that the number one point of difference is customer service and the service is this horrific, well I think that speaks for itself.",1.0,Tablet Fine.

I was really interested in an iPad, but always balked at the price and not a fan of iTunes syncing or using iTunes on my PC at all.  I have an iPhone 4 for my job and I was no longer all that excited about Apple's app store and all the dedicated apps that seem to offer stripped down versions of the web sites, games, or programs that I really want to use on a larger screen.  The Nook Tablet is a great little device, sized just fine for what I use it for and the price is better compared to the iPad.  I really don't read a lot of e-books or e-magazines, but when I do read them on the Nook Tablet, it's a nice experience, but I still prefer physical books and magazines.  It plays MP3s and up to 1080p videos just fine, but like I mentioned, I'm not a fan of having to plug the device into my PC to sideload content or load media onto a memory card (though it's really nice that the Nook has a micro SD slot).  If you're looking for a device for web-browsing, Netflix-watching, and Scrabble (pretty much the only game that I want play on it), then this is a great device.  B&N is still at a disadvantage with a pretty limited app selection compared to Google Play and Amazon's app store and of course Apple's App Store, but after being enamored with my work phone (iPhone 4) for about six months, I'm over the apps and much happier with the Nook Tablet's larger screen, with the 1 GHz processor and 1 GB of RAM, there's plenty of power for my casual web browsing and video watching at home.",5.0,"Great device for web browsing, Netflix, and Flash video.

In fact I dislike reading ebooks on computer having tried a few times. Regardless I purchased this Nook tablet for reading and found it to be enjoyable and have read and finished a few books though I only owned it for about a week. It's comfortable in your hand though you'll have to find the right balance for yourself. Also, it is easy to use since I'm bad with technology and has smooth and fast reactions, as well as easy to turn the page.Reading however was not my only objective, if it was the ereader would be great too and much cheaper but I wanted to use this as an organizer, entertainment, and just for mundane things. The Netflix, browsing, and games are great. The volume is a little low but putting on headphones solves the problem or a quiet area. Organizers are fine as long as you find the right app.The batteries however are lacking in my opinion since I use it to read or entertainment for long periods of time I have to charge the battery daily or at maximum in two days. I think I watched something on Netflix for about 20 minutes and drained almost 5% on my batteries or a little less than that. Another troublesome thing is that at times the browser or app I'm using force closes. Though it doesn't happen too often I get irritated easily.

I use mine just about daily. I read emails on it, read books, watch Netflix while on the treadmill it's amazing to have. I've had a lot of issues with the HULU app, I've had issues where if it times out while I'm on a page and turns off, I'll try to turn it back on and the page I was reading is not visible. Meaning the page before and after is so I have to go out of the book open another book close that then reopen the book I was reading and magically my page reappears.

Today after another 13 minute conversation with someone else who because of the language barrier thought I was asking him to reset my password instead of send me another usb cord(?????) he told me that I should call back in 5 days because they're out of stock on cables.

With low price, fast response, and light weight, book size, and Barn and Nobles support, It is the best device for children when you want to have something as an alternative for your computer.I am a fan of Amazon.com and meant to buy a kindle for my children. but the displayed sample on my local Bestbuy store showed me that the nook tablet responded much faster than kindle fire. It could not be generally true, but based on the displayed tablets, I had to choose the nook.Until now, I have had mainly happy experiences with it. It has apps for children, one of them has many Smithsonian videos that my small children love the most. My college age child also use it to check email at home because it responds in second to wake up, and we do not have to turn it off for many days before it runs slow. After you turn it off and restart it (hold the power button for seconds for on and off), it become fast again.I just found last day it has a recipe App with more than 17,000 recipes. It has pictures for most of the products.My children have asked me to buy the istory app for 3.99 dollars, but it contends 24 or more story books for children that it reads to my children. Wonderful! The American history app is excellent too, It costs me 1 dollar or so (not remember exactly now).Problems: It did start after my children left it idled for hours while a game was running. After the battery was charged for a whole night, it still refused to start. When I tried again in the afternoon, it started but took more than 10 minutes.

Also, if you go online, often they have a deal such that if you buy a year's subscription to the NY Times, they reduce the price of the Tablet.  To get the member's discount, you're better off going to a B&N; store.  BUT THE BIG THING is, if you already own Kindle books, Barnes and Noble stupidly don't provide a Kindle app, HOWEVER, you can buy the cheapest n2a card, either on Amazon or on n2a.com.  This allows you to boot your Tablet up as a full Android tablet (like the $500 ones), and you can get the Kindle app on that.  There's no problem accessing your Kindle books on the Nook.  Since, as noted below, the Nook eReader is beautifully designed, much better in my opinion than any Kindle, so I use my n2a card only when I'm reading a Kindle book.

However, only Nook has the Page Perfect editions and the Enhanced editions of books with embedded video, audio clips, and animations.One other thing: the Nook has a tab for ""My Stuff"" so you can download music, pictures, videos and documents easily onto the Nook. You don't have to buy music for it.  Use what's on your PC or what you rip from disk. I am doing a project of editing and making slide shows of over 4,000 pictures.  For that, I bought a 32 disk san drive for the Nook to download the pictures to and to work on them using a Nook app.  I don't know how you could do that on the 8 gig Fire. I don't know if you can put pictures on the Cloud for the Fire.  However, I can make many different slide shows and digital albums on the Nook Tablet without any Cloud.I got this and the Kindle Fire on November 16, 2012.  Then came days of comparing them side by side.  You can see my review of the Fire on its page's customer reviews, so, how about the Nook?  First of all, if you want one, get it from Barnes and Noble. It cost $199 with a year's subscription to the NY Times.  Even without that discount, it costs $249 with free shipping (and, this month the NOOKcolor Tablet is only $149!)Hands down, for the money there is no finer Tablet than this Nook.  Some reviewers say they're going to get a Sony or a Galaxy for their features. I have no quarrel with that, but you pay for those features.  Sony and Galaxy are fine tablets--I've tried them out, too.  However, the Sony is on sale for $399.99 this month, and the 32 bit is on sale for $499.99.  Comparing it side by side with the Nook, the Sony salesperson said, ""Wow! it's as good as the Sony!""  Yes, and for about the half the price.Another salesman lamented that the Sony doesn't have the Netflix app, which comes with the Nook. Of course, Sony wants you to buy their movies.  Barnes & Noble just wants you to buy their books, which is fine for a Bookaholic like me.  B&N; has 2,500,000 titles available, over 1,000,000 free.  Since they have a lot of earlier editions of books, Book Freaks like me can purchase those or get them free.  They even have a Page Perfect series which are facsimiles of beautifully designed books. What you see on your screen is what a reader in 1867 or 2007 saw, brilliantly illustrated and unusually printed books.  You'd pay a fortune for them in their original editions, not $3.99. Many children's classics are in this series, but also adult books, like Butterflies.The Nook also has Enhanced Editions with audio and video clips embedded in the text.  Some of the old books are also Enhanced.  Changes because of misprints or other errors in the original are underlined.  You touch them, and can see what the original had. One of my Nook Books is a collection of Kafka.  You touch underlined passages and up pops a picture of the street Kafka has mentioned, or of a notable person he's alluded to.  In general, eBooks are superior to paper if they are on a Tablet with access to the Web.  You read in more depth, and can envision what the author is writing about without interrupting your reading experience. The Nook's connection to the Web is as fast as your wifi and is accessible with two clicks: Look up and Google (or Wikipedia).The Nook comes with Pandora and you can also download music from your computer using the USB cord which comes with the Nook.  Pictures, videos and documents can all be downloaded to the Nook, which has built-in folders for each, and, if the 16 Gig iof the Tablet is  not enough for you, you  can put a 32 Gig or smaller SD card.That's not all!  If you're App happy, you  can buy the N2A card for the Nook Tablet, which gives you every App in the Android Marketplace without rooting it and voiding the warranty.  I myself have been happy so far with the thousand or more apps available for the Nook, with new ones being added each week.  Truthfully, if it's apps that are what you want most in a tablet, the way to go is the iPad--for $600-$700 at the least.I gave my granddaughter a Nook Tablet.  Many of her friends have iPads; however, she says, she can get the same apps as her friends do. Using the Drawing app, she designed her birthday party invites on her Nook and then emailed them also using her Nook eMail.  She says she prefers Angry Birds on the Nook.  I can't comment. Angry Birds don't tempt me, but I do play some games on my  Nook.The Nooks have no cameras or Face Time, but with the money you save by buying the Nook, you can get an iPhone which does  have both.  If you want features like that in a Tablet, it costs $500 or more plus monthly data fees. No data fees with the Nook, of course, although you can browse the Web with ease and speed, depending on your router.You can stream movies and TV stories with ease on the Nook.  The picture quality is excellent if your wifi is.  I'm in a rural area with no 4G, but I still get crisp, clear movies with my wifi device.  Apps standard on the Nook are Hulu, Smithsonian, Showtime, and Netflix.  There may be more sources of flicks on it, but, truthfully, I haven't looked--and, since they add apps every week, you have to keep looking.If, like me, your primary use for a Tablet is reading, the Nook is tops.  Their eReader is elegantly designed and beautifully intuitive.  It even tells you how many pages are left in the chapter you'e on.  Notice, it displays page numbers, not ""locations"" like the Fire.  If you can't remember  who a character is, put your finger lightly on the name. 5 popups show instantly.  Touch Find, and in a second you have a page which lists every page that word has been on, complete with it sentence. (You can do this with place names as well.)  The other choices are Highlight, Note, Share, Look Up.  The Share lets you highlight a passage and send it to your Contacts--not social networking sites.  For those, you use the Share option in the menu at the bottom of the screen.  My friends tell me they love getting these passages from me.  Of course, I choose those  that are witty or relevant to a discussion we've had.  Other reading options are Go to Page, Back, Find (for when you want to type in the search screen), Contents, Text options, Brightness and Discover.  This last shows you other books on the subject you're reading about or by the same author.In short, as an eReader, the Nook is tops. As a Tablet, it does well, although not as well as those that are way more expensive.  Actually, everything it does do, it does very well.  It just doesn't have certain features--but that is true of every Tablet I've seen except the iPad.  As of now, the iPad's picture quality is not as good as the Nook's or, for that matter, the Fire's.  The iPad3 will have hi def, however.",5.0,"Outstanding 7"" Tablet",1329350400,"02 16, 2012",Electronics,1.0

I'd cancelled my order for as many Kindle Fires because I felt the technical specs justified the extra $50 for the Nook Tablet.  I also appreciated more onboard storage and expandability since we're a four person family and I drive ... all three were for my wife and kids and not me, and I expected they'd be used on the road a lot.I think that by the time anyone reads this they should know that the tablets (both Kindle and Nook, to be fair) are tied to their respective distributors.  That didn't come as any surprise to me, I fully expected it.  I knew that, without modifying the device (not really acceptable for your average person, if you ask me), I would be stuck with B&N;'s app store.  What I didn't know was how woefully limited that app store really is; it pales in comparison to Amazon's and doesn't even register when compared to the android marketplace.My daughter got hers first (a late birthday present).  For the most part, she was satisfied with it.  I made sure wifi was available throughout the house; we downloaded a couple of apps (Angry Birds, of course, and a drawing program).  The first thing to notice is that the B&N; app store has a tiny selection of free apps.  The ad-sponsored version of Angry Birds can't be found, but for a couple of bucks I didn't mind paying - I paid for the non-ad version for my phone, too.Netflix works as well on the tablet as it does on any other device in my home (PS3 and a bluray player, both hardwired networking) as long as wifi connection is good.  Her other use was email, and since she hardly gets any, the built in app was OK.The other two tablets I purchased were for Christmas for my wife and son, and that's where the problems started.  My wife gets copious amounts of email from several different accounts and likes to keep it as neat as possible... she also uses her smartphone and computer and doesn't want to have to delete things three times.  The built in email application absolutely sucks.  You can't even empty the trash to completely delete messages you don't want.  We experienced this on our phones and installed the highest rated email app we could find on the android marketplace, which also happened to be a FREE app.  B&N; makes nothing by distributing free apps in their marketplace, so this app was not available at all, and the selection was slim for other apps.  Even the touchpad app that people were using to syncronize with Microsoft Exchange servers apparently doesn't work (and is very expensive for an app).As I mentioned, I knew I'd be limited to B&N; app store - I just didn't realize how limited that app store was.My wife then started getting a bunch of free samples of books, and bought several of them.  They all downloaded except one stubborn one.  That book would load just fine on all the other Nooks in our house (the other two Tablets and we have two original Nooks, as well).  I sent an email to technical support and received the usual ""we got your request and will reply as soon as possible"" message, along with the addition that they are experiencing a high volume of help requests.  That was a week ago and we still have not heard back.  After a few days, though, we physically took the Nook to the store to get help.  Nothing worked; off/on, archive/unarchive, even de and re-registered the device (losing our wifi and email configs in the process).  This book still will not load.We finally ""side loaded"" the book, which required installing a program on my wife's PC (which is very annoying in itself) and we were required to create an Adobe ID (how much spam will we get from them, I wonder?).  After side-loading the book, it has no cover art... more annoyance.  That book still won't download correctly, even after they told us it'd be fixed in 48 hours (that was five days ago).I am not one to ""root"" products like these (especially since they aren't ""mine,"" as I won't be the one using them).  As the ""guy,"" it seems I'm responsible for all technical support in the house and didn't want to deal with the ramifications (or, frankly, even take the time to run through all those steps to do it).  It's not that I can't, it's that it's a pain in the buttocks and I simply shouldn't have to.  We were not asking for the world, we were asking for a table that had Nook e-reader software and allowed a few other niceties.  I wasn't expecting an iPad for $250, but I was expecting working software and a functional email program.It's technically not a bad tablet - the screen is bright and clear and responsive; the UI is decent (although I prefer the four buttons on my android phone over the single big ""n"" button on the Nook).  It's solidly built and sturdy; with Angry Birds and Netflix as my only benchmarks I can say they both run much better than they do on my phone, with no pauses (that I saw) in Angry Birds at all.However, the accumulation of annoyances was a bit too much for me (let's say there was a nagging voice coming from somewhere... the other side of the bed).  I am returning all three - luckily B&N; has a holiday policy that will allow me to return them, which is very cool of them.  They have not lost me as a customer; I have my books purchased from them and will continue to buy.I hope them the best in the future; it was a nice try.  If they just weren't so tight fisted about control over content (especially apps, in this case) I'd have stuck with it.  Technically speaking, the device is quite good and, at the current time, IMO, the hardware is worth the price tag.  I wouldn't mind being limited to the B&N; app store if they actually offered more apps... a LOT more, as they have practically nothing compared to what's available for the android community at large.  Again, I'm not asking for an iPad; I know the iPad can do some really cools things this Tablet can't, just something to make the ""tablet"" part of the Nook Tablet more worthwhile.I imagine they'll fix glitches with the download problem, too.  I'm not the only person who had a problem, but I think everyone else managed to find a solution (besides side-loading).  Keep in mind I generally know what I'm doing and tried everything, and the ""expert"" at the brick-and-mortar store couldn't fix it, either.  The lady from Glee didn't come out and entertain us while they fixed our tablet, either... that was disappointing.So that's my review - it's decent hardware hamstrung by a few bugs and tight fisted control over content.  Some will argue that it's not meant to be a tablet, it's meant to be an e-reader, but let's be honest - it's marketed as a tablet; it's called the Nook TABLET.  It doesn't have to be an iPad, but it should work a lot better than it does at being a tablet.",2.0,"People shouldn't be surprised about what it is, but still disappointing.",1325635200,"01 4, 2012",Electronics,0.0

The people at Walmart didn't want you near them, and didn't know ANYTHING about them. Best Buy was pretty much the same, except you could 'sorta' test them out. BN though had people trained to know EVERYTHING about them, even the stuff that was not listed about them on the BN website.First thing not listed: if the Nook Colour can do it, so can the Nook Tablet. (for instance... read .cbz files without installing any extra apps)The 16gb model was much more responsive than the 8gb, so to me it was well worth the extra 50 bucks.Add to that that currently if you buy one at BN and don't like it, you have 2 weeks to return it for a full refund as long as it is still in new condition (so no attempting to root the device, which from what the rep told me will brick it unlike the Colour)that pretty much sold me, I found a place with micro SD cards on sale, bought a few, and took my Nook home.Pros:The screen is AWESOME! I use it for reading .cbz comics and .pdf files more than anything. The missing gap between the glass and screen made reading much better. Also the response on the touch screen was great.much better response time at turning pages, launching apps and using the inet that other tablets in the budget rangenative flash supportnative .cbz support (main reason I bought it)supports almost every popular ebook format except for .mobi (which can be converted to epub or .pdf anyway)good size for holding one handed for reading and lightweight (under a pound)battery life... 11 hours+ with wifi off, 8+ with it on, I tried it out and watched lots of movies and did some reading on it without it coming close to dying on me.a test drive opportunity if you buy it at BN and dont scratch it up or anything. I like the idea that I was able to take it home and so if it actually does everything that I want it to do wihtout a fear that I'm stuck with it for good.also if you buy it from BN you can buy an 'oops' return warranty (which means if you spill coffee on it or drop it, it can be replaced)affordable if you go without things like eating out 2x a week for awhileCons:lack of Android Market, lack of some apps I would like to see on the BN market (such as Google Music app) no sideloading apps at the moment either. That being said, this also means that apps available from BN will actually work with your Nook, there isnt a quantity over quality in the app store either. This means that if you've bought an app from Android market, you will have to buy it again if you want to use it on the Nook.The screen. trust me, I love it. But unlike other tablets where if you crack the glass you just have to replace the glass, on the Nook if you crack it, the screen is toastno front facing camera (or any camera for that matter). The ability to use Skype would have been nice, but wasn't a complete necessity. I've had many friends with tablets that had a camera that swear they never used it even once, and thinking about it, I wuld seldom use it either since most places outsite of my house that I will use it are places where video chatting would be frowned on, like Starbucks or the libraryno bluetooth, which to me didn't matter, but it seems to be an issue for some people. There IS bluetooth, but it's disabled and there isn't a way to enable itno GPS, this would be nice, unlike bluetooth, I would actually use it.mono speaker instead of stereo, again seems to be an issue for other people, I plug it into the minijack on my surround sound at home or the jack in my car stereo when I'm on the road though and its just fine. I use headphones if I'm out and about. Why on earth would I care about speakers that I never use anyway?no .flac support. a good chunk of my digital music now is .flac. it does have .ogg support thoughno .avi support. again, a massive portion of my movies etc are all in .avi format.

I downloaded some of my pdf files, checked my email, got on the web, and got a couple of reading materials from the Nook store....then I looked at the apps selection of the B&N store -- jeeze, very limited.  I had read multiple enthusiastic reviews talking about downloading third party apps, went online and was very happy to download several of the same apps I use on my smart phone that are not available on the B&N store.  I got a few apps, sideloaded them, and was happy.  At this point I would say I would have given 4.5 stars if I reviewed it right then and even told my friends and patients the same.  Then I turned on my NT right before Christmas, and the third party app capability had disappeared.  I discovered that the 1.4.1 firmware update that was pushed to us unsuspecting users had disabled the capability of third party apps.  Talk about disappointed -- The main reasons I got the NT (instead of a Kindle Fire) were #1 the android OS that allows you to run literally thousands of apps, and #2 the memory card expansion slot.  Now, with third party apps locked out, the NT in my eyes has significantly lost value, in fact it really isn't much more than an eReader now -- and I could have spent a lot less and got either a black/white version or nook color if an eReader is all I wanted.  It was marketed as a ""Nook Tablet"" and that is what I expected when I bought it.  Now I am really thinking hard about taking it back.  Nook ""tablet"" my foot - without decent apps, this thing is basically a nook color that costs a lot more.  This is a totally bone headed move on B&N's part, and very draconian.  I understand that they want users to buy content from them instead of a competitor  -- OK, fine, but how about offering some content in terms of apps that I want or need? What about free apps from other sources that you wouldn't make money on anyway? What about the apps I already paid for via the android store that I use on my smart phone, that I am allowed by their EULA to put on more than 1 device, say my NT plus my smart phone? I would love to put some of those apps on my NT, but either B&N wants me to buy another copy from them now just to use on my Nook, or I am just SOL if they don't have it available in their store.  How many times do I really need to pay for Angry Birds?  Do you think people buy MP3s from iTunes, then turn around and buy the same MP3s from Google, then turn around and buy the same MP3s from Amazon?  Well, then why should B&N insist that you do?  I don't have a huge issue with them steering customers back to them, if they just offered more selection in their app store.  Have a look at the android market - I think they have over 50,000 apps, Look at the Amazon app store -- over 24,000 apps (many free) -- I know that is their competitor, but they need to improve their own selection if they want to keep me as a customer.  They have basically said to their customers you buy from us, or you buy from no one.  You lock people down, you tell them you only buy from one source (B&N) and then offer a pittance when compared to your competition, and even charge for some apps that are free elsewhere, or charge for apps the customer has already bought somewhere else previously, then don't be surprised when customers leave you for other products.  The Nook has superior hardware, but it doesn't mean Jack if you can't have the software you need/want in order to utilize the hardware -- like I said I'll probably take it back to the store.  I'd rather have a Kindle Fire or true android Tablet so that I can use the software I want to use.  And now when my friends and patients ask, I am now telling them to buy something else where you can actually use the software you want - I have totally came around 180 since the B&N ""update"" stripped one of the best capabilities out of the Nook Tablet.

It has so many really irritating quirks and problems.  I've never used any other brand, so I can't compare, but I definitely don't recommend getting a Nook Color.The biggest problem is that the battery life is abysmal.  After just a couple months use, I now only get about 2 hours of use on a full charge, even with the screen dimmed quite a bit.  Since I want to use this when I'm traveling and don't usually have access to an outlet, this is a HUGE problem and extremely limits its usefulness.Besides that:* It has a tendency to turn itself on.  This happens whenever I put in or remove the power plug and sometimes just when it gets jostled.  Sometimes I don't notice because the cover is closed. Turning itself on after I remove the power plug definitely doesn't help with the already abysmal battery power.* When I'm using it while it is plugged in and charging, which is most of the time because of the poor battery, it repeatedly displays the battery charging message, ever 10-20 seconds for a second or so.  This is VERY disruptive when trying to read, forcing me to pause and wait until it disappears.*  While reading, the menu at the bottom pops up A LOT too, for no apparent reason, covering the lower text.* Sometimes books get stuck on one page and won't advance or will skip pages.  It takes quite a bit of finagling to get it to show the missing pages.* There are a few spots on the screen that don't respond to touch, especially near the upper and right edges, which is where webpages usually have critical navigation buttons.* The zoom feature is very hard to use, and the zoom level doesn't stay the same  when moving from page to page, especially on websites. I try to zoom the webpages so I can access buttons under the dead touchscreen spots, but the page won't stay zoomed in when trying to move the page to get to the desired spot.* The touchscreen doesn't work well on webpages, often selecting a different item than the one touched.  This often sends me zinging off to undesired links.* The on-screen keypad doesn't always pop up when trying to type something on a webpage, and there's no way to manually make it show.* The Nook's book filing system is rudimentary and hard to sort.  I would especially like to be able to sort by rating, but it doesn't allow that.  I'd also like to be able to tag books, but can't do that either.* The B&N; online store search is terrible.  You can't do a dual search to narrow down long lists, and it will only list the books alphabetically by title.  On the tiny Nook screen, it takes forever to scroll through long results.  You can't exclude tags.  When I search for mysteries, there's all this paranormal stuff mixed in that I'd like to exclude but can't.* I can't look through my own reviews on the Barnes and Noble website using the Nook Color.  It doesn't support that feature.  I can only access them on my regular laptop.  Dunh.  I read a lot of books and can't keep track of all of them.  It would be handy when I'm thinking about buying a book by an author I've read before to be able to see what I thought of the author's other book.* Some Google apps and Flash Player apps don't work on the Nook.  I subscribe to NFL Game Rewind, something I enjoy when I'm on the road, but I can't watch it on my Nook Color.One thing I do like is that there are a lot of really good, free books for the Nook Color available through the B&N; online store.And I like that I can watch Netflix.",2.0,"abysmal battery life, plus lots of really irritating little problems",1397692800,"04 17, 2014",Electronics,0.0

I previously owned a first generation Nook, but wanted an e-reader that was in color and offered extras such as web browsing and games, etc. I didn't need a device that was a full mini-computer, so the Nook Tablet was perfect for me.I've had my Nook Tablet now for almost a month, having picked it up at a local B&N; store the day it was released. It took only a couple of minutes to set mine up, since I was a previous Nook owner. My husband got one at the same time, his first Nook, but his only required a few more minutes to set up than mine.WHAT I LOVE:1) I am enjoying the full color. While I loved the eInk technology of my old Nook, being able to look at my books and magazines in color is wonderful. The default brightness was a bit much for me, but I was easily able to tone it down to get close to the brightness of the eInk technology, without sacrificing the clarity and color of books, magazines and other apps. The shiny screen hasn't been an issue for me.2) I love the in-store experience, where I can have full access to an e-book for up to an hour a day. When my hour's up, I can decide whether to buy the book, add it to my wishlist for later or just ""check out"" another e-book for another hour. My husband and I have enjoyed having a couple of ""Nook Book"" dates at B&N.;3) Buying books & apps on the Nook Tablet has been easy to do. (All my old purchases from my 1st generation Nook came over without any effort on my part.) I've enjoyed finding cheap reads, like an 81-book collection of public domain classic books for just $3.99. And while it took a little doing, I have set myself up to check out books from my local public library. I am definitely reading more.4) I have also enjoyed buying a couple of games, like Scrabble, Pot Smash and Quell. Lots of fun, even if it cuts into my reading time a bit.5) I have activated Pandora (which came loaded on the Nook Tablet) and am enjoying it. I tried to sideload some music onto my SD card, but the resident music player doesn't work as well as I would like, but Pandora is great. So far, I'm just doing the free service. (BTW, there is an external volume control, unlike the new Kindle Fire.)6) Reading books on the Nook Tablet has been easy to do. I bought a cover which helps to protect my Nook, but also gives me a ""book feel"". Page turning, adjusting font size and look, etc. have been easy to do. I have found it helpful to lock the screen orientation, so the book I'm reading doesn't automatically rotate between portrait and landscape when I shift my sitting position a tad. (FYI, ePub books allow you to adjust fonts, but not PDF books.)7) I've done some Web browsing when I've been in a WiFi area. I never planned to do extensive browsing, so the Tablet works well for me. It's not as good as browsing on a PC or maybe even on a larger tablet like iPad, but it's definitely better than on my cell phone.8) I had a SD card on my old Nook, so all I had to do was swapped it over to my new Tablet. Worked perfectly. I have always kept my personal content (Word Docs, photos, music and PDFs) on my SD card, so the fact that the new Tablet was designed to work this way was fine with me.THINGS I WISH WERE BETTER:1) I can't print from the Nook. The best I can do is open up my book or magazine on my PC through the ""Nook for PC"" app and copy & paste my selection into a Word document for printing.2) I can't organize my music or photos into playlists or slideshow groupings. When you play music or do the slideshow, everything is mixed together. Since starting to use Pandora, the music hasn't been as much of as issue.  (28-Dec-2011 Update: Figured out how to create playlists in the resident music player. Now need to figure out how to group my photos.)3) I wish you could lend out a book more than once under the ""Lend Me"" feature. With a printed book, a book can be lent out more than once. I certainly understand B&N; and the publishers not wanting to have a purchased e-book loaned out too many times, as that represents a potential loss of revenue, but to be only able to lend once for 14 days seems a bit limited.4) I have had mixed results with tech support. I've used both in-store support twice and phone support three times. Sometimes I've gotten great results and other times, not so much. I can say that in all cases, the persons helping me did try really hard to help me and they were very nice..So All in All, I am very happy with my purchase. I can recommend the Nook Tablet to anyone who is looking for an e-reader that offers more than just reading. It may not be a full blown computer like other tablets on the market, but for what it is, it does a great job (especially for the price). The Nook Tablet is the size and weight of a small hardback book, so it feels like a book, but it's much more than a book. It's a whole library of books, magazines, games, etc.",5.0,Love my new Nook Tablet,1323993600,"12 16, 2011",Electronics,1.0

If you manage to root this device (voiding your warranty) you still won't have bluetooth, GPS, a camera, HDMI, nor the ability to easily connect your Nook to your monitor, TV, printer, keyboard, or mouse. You will only have internet access when you're near wifi, no option of 3G service.If you're looking for an e-Reader, just buy a regular e-Reader. The reading experience on the Nook is NOT the same as classic e-Readers, which seem to have more of a paper appearance to their screens. Reading on the Nook is just okay and is best in sunlight. I'm not too thrilled about reading on this while in bed, for instance, as it's not as gentle on the eyes when compared to regular eReaders. If you're not used to reading on a regular eReader, this might not be a problem at all for you. If you like the eReader experience, these types of devices will disappoint. While you can change the background color and dim the screen, it is a far inferior reading experience.I, personally, purchased this device believing there would be some setting that would make the reading experience like one on a regular eReader. While the Nook has a lovely screen and beautiful Netflix playback, it's not a good eReader unless you're reading a lot outdoors.I bought this knowing that the app selection was poor, but not realizing just how poor it really is. B&N; seriously needs to open up this device for more learning apps. After my initial disappointment, I just figured I would let my children have my Nook. It *seems* to be great for kids as they can use the various learning tools, and they're more likely to reread books than I am. But, when it came to looking for various math, spelling, and other learning material for my 7 and 10 year old sons, the selection was dismal at best!It's cool to play Angry Birds on a larger screen to the tune of 3 bucks per version... and Drawdle is a huge hit with my boys, but the excitement sort of ends there. The excitement really ended after I paid 2 bucks for a spelling app that isn't even compatible with my device. The way the market is locked down, that shouldn't even be possible! As for Netflix, well... how many places will I have wifi and the time and ability to watch a movie also? At home I can just watch Netflix on the big screen TV. It would be most useful for long car rides if you have mobile hotspot on your phone. But, of course, streaming from your mobile hotspot will just eat up your monthly usage!All in all, I say it's a very confused device. If you're looking to buy this, save yourself the money and just buy the Nook Color for $169. The tablet is a little faster and a little lighter in weight, but $250 sort of exceeds this device's usefulness. I was also planning to read library books on my Nook... only to learn that I don't have access to the Overdrive app in order to do so. If there is some roundabout way to accomplish this, I just haven't put in the time to investigate.I honestly think this device is best suited for kids just because big touch screens are fun. In the end it's an over-sized android phone without the market... or the phone lol. It's a cool toy for a kid (maybe 8-18 years of age) to have for the family on a budget, I guess. But to me, it's starting to feel like a waste of money. I'm not too keen on the reading experience, and while both of my kids are just dying to get time on the Nook, the learning app selection is *severely* limited. However, as my kids aren't as picky as I am, they would actually get some use out of this device as an eReader. Yet, since this doesn't seem to be a device designed for kids, I do wonder how long it will take them to break it. =-p",3.0,What are you looking for???,1332201600,"03 20, 2012",Electronics,0.0

One reviewer reported even the B&N; tech person in the store was unable to enable the Nook Tablet to download library eBooks.EBooks cannot be directly downloaded onto the Nook.According to my librarian, B&N; has made this a more complicated process than on the Kindle Fire, needing more steps, but the Overdrive Platform accessed through the library website which uses the ""Adobe Digital Editions"" Application provides the needed interface to bring the library onto the Nook Tablet through your home computer.My county library system has a Downloadable Library that is powered by Overdrive.com.  Overdrive works with thousands of publishers to distribute eBooks to libraries, schools and retail establishments like B&N.;  With the help of the reference librarian at my city library I was able to successfully link to the ""Overdrive"" website through my library's website and then download the ""Adobe Digital Editions"" Application onto my home computer.  The Reference Librarian talked me through parts of the process on the phone. I called twice for help not wanting to tie her up while I went through the registration process.This Application is offered free from Adobe.com but does require registration with Adobe to access and download it.  The library eBook editions are then downloaded and stored on the home computer through the ""Adobe Digital Editions"" Application.  The digital book copy can be transfered from the home computer to as many as 4 other digital devices (Adobe allows for this), but each digital device must be authorized before downloading the very first eBook.This was a long and overly complicated process it seems to me, and it took close to 2 hours for me to complete all the steps and then download a library book through the library's Downloadable Library site to the ""Adobe Digital Editions"" platform on my computer. I finally was able to transfer the eBook from my computer onto the Nook through the Nook Tablet's USB cable connected to my computer. My husband made sure that we safely disconnected the cable from the computer through a pop-up from the task bar before physically separating the Nook Tablet from the cable connection.Through this Adobe application I am able to read the downloaded eBook edition on my computer.  I put an icon on my desktop for quick access the platform. And ... I can read the book on my Nook Tablet as well. Hopefully the next eBook I download from the library will be an easy and swift process since all is now in place for this to occur smoothly and quickly.I have done this once and it worked perfectly, but downloading an 874 page book swallowed 60% of the Nooks 1 GB of memory that is designated for ""My Files"" on the device.  I await the arrival of aSanDisk 32 GB microSDHC Flash Memory Card (card only) SDSDQM-032G.  There isn't a lot more that can be downloaded onto ""My Files"" without it.This is the first device of this sort that we have bought (no cell phone or Ipod or other such devices), so I have few expectations at this point. Downloading library books was of critical importance for me.  I actually like the Nook. I love the Pandora app that comes pre-installed. Beautiful color screen with crisp images. I like that I have web access and can email things I want to read from my main computer to the Nook or download an article from the web and store it in ""My Files"" to read later.I have another week to decide if this is a keeper.  I'll update this review if there is more to say.  I might change my rating then.  Only 3 stars now because of the already known and often discussed limitations, the expensive apps and the overly complicated library download process.Hope this helps.",3.0,"The Nook Tablet does support library downloads, but enabling it was time consuming.",1328745600,"02 9, 2012",Electronics,0.0

We requested a replacement from Worldwide Distributors, but they refused, suggesting that it was a warranty issue. I then filed a complaint claim with Amazon, who contacted Worldwide Distributors. Their response was to point out that their return policy states that they will not take back electronic products which have been opened. (How else can a buyer find out if it works?) That's a nice gig if you can get it, selling high dollar electronic products with no responsibility whatsoever if they turn out to be worthless junk. Unfortunately, Amazon backed up their claim, based on the ""published"" return policy. In 12 years as a steady Amazon buyer, I've never looked up and read a return policy.

I was disappointed that many of the books offered from Amazon were not available on the nook so I purchased a Kindle Fire. The Kindle was priced lower, the sample readings of a book are larger, the screens change smother, and I greatly prefer it to the nooks and after being a customer with Amazon many years, I know that I can count on Amazon to have superior customer service.

Since then, I have memorized the use of my Nook inside-out, and know all the Pro's and Con's.Pro's1. Very user friendly. Has an easy to use menu button that lets you hop from one place to another on your Nook. You are able to put allot of your personal content on the home screen, making it really easy to get to your favourite apps and books quickly.2. Great storage. The Nook Tablet has 16 GB built in, and the memory is expandable up to 32 GB via a MicroSD[HC] Card. Content stored on card runs pretty fast for a Tablet.3. Best-ever e-book reader. Its nothing that can be fought againsed: Nooks are the best e-readers of all time. You can change the size of the text, background page color and picture settings easy. Has a built-in dictionary that can be used to look up words that you don't understand in that new Hunger games best-seller, or just to look up any random word when reading Pilgrim's Progress. Overall, a great E-Reader.4. Large selection of apps. The Nook store always will have the newest Fruit Ninja app, the new temple Run and much more. ranging from gaming apps to apps that will help your business thrive, the Nook store has it all.Con's1. The processor. Sometimes the Nook will run into reboots that can take up to a minute, though they never actually seem to help the Nook itself. It can't handle that many downloads at once, which can make your downloading of the Angry Birds series.2. Hard to unlock. Unlike allot of other tablets, Barnes & Noble really have this one guarded. It is very hard to hack it (Legally)to get all of the Google Play apps. There's a card that can do that, but it costs $50. So, not the best for the techy-app types.3. Poor speaker. The Nook's speaker isn't the best. Even at full volume it isn't that loud. The only way to really hear anything good is with headphones.So, it seems like there's some for getting it and some for not getting it. But it sure works for me. At least it has a better e-reader than the Kindle Fire.",4.0,A pretty good Tablet.,1380067200,"09 25, 2013",Electronics,1.0

I've had it 3 days.This thing gets 4 stars as an E Reader (-1 star for being in BN lockdown mode), 3 stars as a TABLET (limited app availability) and 5 stars for being the perfect pre-bedtime Entertainment TV/Reader.My background as a reviewer is I have an android smartphone, a 2010 Compaq laptop with Windows 7 and I'm a lifer as a PC (non-mac) user. Never owned a tablet nor an EReader but I've used the NOOK app on my smartphone (which is amazing BTW). I've perused the previous NOOKS and was very disappointed at the buttons and user interface.  This is a SIGNIFICANT improvement over the previous, with a fast duo-core processor, micro SD expandable, and it claims to have 16 GB on board memory (ONLY 1 GB IS FOR YOUR PC-TRANSFERRED MEDIA: CAUTION!). I don't know yet if the expandable micro SD will give you more space for NON-BARNES AND NOBLE content.  I see this is a major, major, major star deduction in the Quote Unquote.....""Tablet"" category.  It takes this little gizmo from HERO to almost ZERO for this user. :(  I'll have to get a separate tablet OR return this one.That said, I see advantages to being the ""best"" at only a few things.It's primarily an E reader and Netflix and HULU viewer with Web surfing capability. As someone who was not doing much e-reading on my smartphone or laptop (occasional textbook or a Nook book loaned to me), I am sooo loving that the NOOK Tablet introduced me to the new way convenient way (inexpensively) to save paper, read books, magazines, and newspaper WITHOUT extra clutter.  I am a chronic book purchaser, so having my first E READER may take care of my ""where the heck do I put these books?"" -- problem. BTW, I am loving having my smartphone (Sony X10)sharing of nook books and mags on the go, and my NOOK articles for bedtime reading. Textbooks: lady in the store said textbooks, if they are PDF or PUB files, can be viewed on this here thingy. BUT and this is a big BUT... Mind the ONLY 1 GB OF YOUR OWN MEDIA THING.Ok, this 1GB of memory thing may cause the review to have 1 more star taken off for the dishonesty of the ""16 GB"" claim, and the non-open-source nature of their BNAndroid OS, and 1 star added back -ok, ok- for the really super low price. That keeps the review at 4. :( Hmmph.Netflix + E Reading beautifully + Web + flash playing video + dedicated volume on side + cute little keychain loop (design) = $249.00 (that's not bad!)Having a dedicated E-reader ""plus more"" might just be what I've been looking for.  A laptop is too clunky sometimes.  Inconvenient for pre-bedtime movie streaming. The limitless book seleciton capabilities (I can change selections if I'm bored) is such a nice benefit to having a NOOK.ANDROID:  This seems to be B and N hybrid version of Android OS.This little tablet reader is great because then--it limits how media explosive you're allowed to be.  Sometimes I think that we are ""overwhelmed"" by too many options. This device is great for bedtime ET. don't get a bedroom TV get a nook. But then buy a tablet PC also, for virtual online school and/or work for your MS OFFICE and all that stuff. Very limited app avaiilabilitiy. But for like $4 bucks there is a NOOK office app that, I 've heard, lets you do Office things. (you can read them for free, but to edit: buy the app).So.. If you speak android phone already, you will feel frustrated a bit with limited app avail. (No Google MAPS app, for example). However, you quickly realize that ah ha! It's different from your smart phone, and that's something to love. The netflix app dissipates any bad feelings, alone. Then, the ""flash"" player ability (type in you tube and you stream videos on web,directly - try that on your previous android OS).Even though you can't have amazon, best buy, google reader apps- which I find essential, you can WEB browse these sites. I don't know how to PODCAST upload This american life yet and that's a bummer, but I can just do that on my smart phone.Pros: netflix app, web browsing, great color resolution, access to B and N is convenient. Dedicated volume rocker control, ""expandable"" micro SD ""claims "" to go up to 32 or additional 32 GB but other users have found this to be untenable.Cons: You can forget about 90 percent of the apps you know and love. Only have few nook apps (probably because of this being a B and N android applied OS).CAUTION as ANOTHER reviewer pointed out ONLY 1 GB OF THE ON BOARD MEMORY BELONGS TO YOUR CONTENT: MUSIC, VIDEO, DOCS, WHATEVER. The rest is B and N reserved territory.Music: Does not play WMV files so you'll have to convert them to MP3 before uploading to the NOOK.Sound: onboard speaker is ok.  I really enjoyed the listening experience with headphones, watching favorite TV shows streaming.  The TV / netflix HULU streaming are thus far my favorite features.Plus, and this is a big plus-- I love the reader. Click* and the page turns. Mmmm.  I know E readers aren't new. But the set up was SO EASY.  I don't mind that these are not ""E-ink"" pages because I read sort of slow and - well,- honestly, I guess I'm staring at a laptop in full-color all day anyways. So the Reader is not a problem, to me. I've heard some say if you've an avid page turner, you need to go with the monochrome Nook in B and W. BUY YOUR SCREEN PROTECTOR, HOLDER, AND ACCESSORIES AT AMAZON THEY ARE WAY CHEAPER HERE.I might have to buy a separate Tablet, or, a PC Tablet. For $249 (at B and N stores or online), this thing is a fantastic addition to my home entertainment set-up, organization of books (saves paper and space), and a lightweight little buddy for web surfing on an ample screen.For tablet, I'm thinking of the Samsung Galaxy 10.1, Motorola Xoom, HP TouchPad, Sony S, or even perhaps HP Slate.  It might be nice to have the (Tablet) productivity machine in your life be ""separate"" from your home leisure entertainment device.  The NOOK is that home leisure entertainment compain.  All the while, it is still light enough to sneak around with you.  You may love it so much you'll jealously guard it from the public, and keep it at home for safekeeping, lest you drop it, scratch it, or someone hijacks it from you. And if it does get hi-jacked you can set a password for acessing the NOOK , just like cell phones. That way, you are safeguarding your docs, photos, personal stuff from the wrong hands.",4.0,"Don't get a bedroom TV, get a NOOK tablet",1323216000,"12 7, 2011",Electronics,1.0

If you have nothing else to do with your money besides hand it over to Barnes & Noble, then go ahead and buy this tablet; you'll love it! Everything-and I mean everything that you want to put on this tablet you must purchase from Barnes & Noble. The first thing that you'll notice is that you are locked out of the Android market, the Google market and the Amazon market for apps, and for e-books. You MUST purchase from Barnes & Noble. Barnes & Noble's apps are overpriced. Barnes & Noble expected me to pay $.99 for a calculator! A calculator?Want to try out a trial version of Angry Birds or any other popular game to see if you like it before you purchase it? Forget it! You can't there are no free trials at Barnes & Noble! There are free trials of business software, but they're very limited and their obvious purpose is to require you to buy the more expensive, full program. For my purposes much of the business software is pretty much useless.E-books. You must purchase your new e-books from Barnes & Noble. I'm working on a Masters thesis the present time. I had purchased the book that had a lot of background information that I needed from Amazon.com. It cost $14.99.

I don't know about you but I can't afford such nonsense.I purchased a Barnes and Noble Nook Tablet on 1/6/2012. I used their web site as a research tool. Glowing reviews, promises of 16GB storage capacity and ample access to ""thousands"" of apps had me convinced. However when it arrived I discovered that the 16GB storage was only 1GB for me, and all of the rest for content that I was to be forced to purchase from B&N;! Barnes & Noble completely locked me out of the entire android market. In other words, unless it is purchased from B&N; - YOU AIN'T PUTTING IT ON YOUR TABLET! Come to find out Barnes & Noble offers practically no android apps. The books they offer for free you can get many from the Gutenberg Project web site for free. Lame books!

Everything that entertains and informs me all in my coat pocket.If it's comes down to whether you should buy a Kindle Fire or a Nook Tablet, Nook clearly wins.  Yes, it's 50 bucks more but it's 50 dollars well spent. The Nook has more memory and a faster processor than the Fire.  In real end-user terms that means you get the responsive light touch and quick displays iPad users know so well. Kindle Fire doesn't quite cut it.Most important (and I don't know why this isn't a no-brainer)you can store all your pics, docs, music and books on the Nook itself.

It's even smaller than the font size on the NC and Nook Tablet and it's a bigger size item.  And there is no way to make it bigger.  Nice.  Not.As you are reading a book, if you tap on the screen to access the chapters, page slider, font size etc. ---- all of that is way too small and where the heck is the Brightness Slider? Oh, that's right ---- it's not THERE any more!  Who's idiot idea was that?6) when you tap on a word to access the dictionary, it often freezes or is unresponsive.  Then when the dictionary options do come up, and you tap on Look Up, often THAT freezes. Say what? Oh, and when the definition does appear, the font is so small, it's almost unreadable.I normally read my books in a much larger font size and on the NC/NT, the definitions are readable.  Even though this tablet does have Text to Talk, it's not that great and I don't want text to talk, thank you.7) The web browser does freeze often but this was a big problem with the NC/NT  too.8) when watching a movie, you cannot easily access the Brightness bar, and when you try to tap on the Movie slider to advance or go back, that sucker disappears faster than you can ever imagine.  On the NT, that slider stayed for at least a few seconds, enough for your finger to get on it.  Very annoying.  Also, again the Brightness button is not easily accessed.  You have to tap on Settings, go to the Brightness setting, adjust it and then find your movie in the Main Menu and reopen it.9) The keyboard is a joke, as it was on the NC/NT.  Come on, how hard is it to have a ""qwerty"" keyboard with numbers at the top.  All other tablets have that.10) The Brightness button in not on the tool bar when you are in the book reader as it was in versions past.If B&N; had kept all the aspects of the Nook Tablet, adding the gorgeous HD display, the larger, less bulky hard drive, and the more robust processor of the HD+ , the Nook HD+ would be a winner-winner, chicken dinner!Hate to say it but:My husband has the new 10"" ASUS HD tablet and I think that's actually a better buy!

Mediocre tablet that is decent for media consumption but is limited at media creation.  Limited Out-of-the-box functionality because it seems to have been designed to require third-party apps. Total Cost of Ownership is $400.I readily admit I am not the target user Barnes and Noble (B&N;) had in mind for the NOOK Tablet.  I spend a lot of time flying for work and my needs were for a supplement to my laptop. Tablets, including the vaunted iPad, are meant for enjoying media (music, video, casual games, reading) and not for editing or creating new content.  The 7"" tablets are even more hampered by their limited screen space.  So why did I choose a 7"" tablet instead of an iPad or 10"" competitor?  Price.  The large tablets start at $600 and after adding peripherals your Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) is $900 - $1000, which is the same price as a good laptop that does everything...except run on battery for a 6+ hour flight.After a lot of online research, I settled on the NOOK Tablet.  B&N; has a 14-day return policy so I put the Tablet through rigorous functionality testing to determine whether to keep it or not.  As much as possible, I only used the built-in applications and made no changes to the hardware or software.  I will not discuss the hardware because you can find dozens of reviews online.  These are my results.Reading books. Naturally, the Tablet excels.  My concern was that it be able to remember bookmarks on multiple books and PDFs even after powering off and/or removing the SD card.  Verdict: PASSReading magazines.  B&N; tells you up front that you have to cancel your emagazine subscriptions and use their web store.  I tried reading PDF versions and online subscriptions through Zinio's website (which supports everything except NOOKs).  There just is no easy way to read multi-column magazine articles on a 7"" tablet.  This is too bad because my second reason to get a tablet was to stop carrying around 15 pounds of magazines.  Verdict: FAILReading and editing MS Office Documents and PDFs.  This is 70% of my job and the primary reason for purchasing a tablet.  The Tablet has a lite MS Office reader and a PDF reader.  Both are good at reading documents. Neither allow editing or adding notes to documents.  For about $20 you can buy excellent third-party apps that allow editing both types of documents. (Note: Animations in PowerPoint do not animate so the Tablet is not suitable for showing animated presentations.)  The virtual keyboard is the biggest limitation.  Most internal apps do not support rotation so the keyboard is not much wider than a smartphone keyboard.  You have to type with your index fingers to keep from hitting numerous keys.  Where the keyboard totally fails is a lack of cursor keys.  If you have a typo in the middle of word, there is no way to move the cursor to the exact letter you want it on.  Retyping entire words is not uncommon.  Verdict: FAILEmail.  The Tablet has email capabilities and works really well with GMAIL accounts.  However, security is appalling.  Once your enter your account and password you are never prompted for it again.  This means if someone picks up your Tablet they can read your email.  The settings can be changed to require a password to compose email, but it does not appear to work.  Enabling the 4 number passcode on the Tablet is the only security you have.  Because of this, I have not tried connecting to my work MS Exchange server and probably never will.  Verdict: FAILWeb Browsing.  The Tablet has a good web browser that supports Flash Video, which means you can watch YouTube videos.  You can keep bookmarks and open HTML pages stored on the media card. The primary browsing limitations are the screen size (and obviously need for a wireless connection).  Verdict: PASSCalendar and To-Dos.  There are no built-in apps for either of these, which seems unthinkable.  Even a basic smartphone has these.  You can download free ones from the B&N; app store.  Verdict: FAILNote Taking.  No built-in app for writing notes!  The Tablet has a microphone, but you can't even create audio notes.  Note taking is the one killer app I wanted for home use.  I write notes everywhere to the point of being buried by them.  Third-party apps saves the day.  Evernote works great with the Tablet - and supports audio notes and keyboard rotation.  Verdict: FAILMusic.  The music player is absolute garbage and there is currently no third-party alternative.  The first week the music player would skip a lot and even crash the Tablet when playing MP3s from the SD card.  Recovery was horrible because the Tablet wouldn't shut down and then wouldn't power up without being connected to the power cord.  Fortunately, a firmware update solved the instability problem.  Despite four ways of sorting music, finding and playing music in the order you want is terrible (see comments on audiobooks).  You can pause and resume a song but you cannot stop.  There is no stop button.  The speaker on the Tablet is lousy.  My two-year old Blackberry phone has a better speaker and it's 1/3rd the size of the Tablet.  The speaker is very loud though so will fill a hotel room with mediocre sound.  Surprisingly, the speaker sounds no worse even though covered up when the Tablet is in a carrying case.  Verdict: FAILAudiobooks.  You would think an ebook reader would also have good support for audiobooks.  The internal memory and media card have folders for specific media types.  You can even create your own folders on the SD card.  However, no matter where you put your media, the Tablet finds all of it and dumps it into either the music player or the media player.  There is no way to separate audiobooks from music.  Where the music player completely fails is playing audiobooks in sequential order.  Most software applications sort by reading a filename from left to right and sorting on the first character difference it finds.  The music player apparently looks at the first few characters and then the last characters and ignores the middle ones.  For example, an audiobook with multiple discs and chapters should sort by discs first (1, 2, 3) and then by chapter (1,2,3).  Instead the Tablet sorts by placing all the chapter ones together and then all the chapter twos and so one.  The file manager sorts alphabetically so you have to open the media card file manager and play audiobooks from there. Verdict: FAILPictures.  The Tablet is a pretty good electronic photo album with all the pinch-and-zoom features you expect.  However, like the music player, there's no way to segregate pictures into albums.  I loaded a document with a ton of embedded images and they ended up in the media gallery as well.  You can delete images from the gallery...except the sample pictures for some reason. Verdict: PASS (but hoping for a feature update or third-party alternative soon)Video.  NetFlix and Hulu work good over a wireless connection, but you may get lower resolutions due to the bandwidth limits of a wireless connection.  Playing stored video files requires using the media player. Even though the web browser supports Flash video, the media player does not.  As long as you convert your videos to .m4v format, you can put anything on the Tablet (Handbrake or RealPlayer is perfect for converting video on a PC/Mac).  The image quality is great, although I seem to notice a slight flicker in converted Flash videos like they are playing at 28 frames per second rather than 30.  The media player does not support scene selection/jumping to chapters in movies and has no bookmarking feature.  Unlike the music player which will play in the background, you cannot multitask.  If you leave the media player to use another app, your video will stop.  Unfortunately, videos get lumped into the media gallery with photos and the thumbnail appears to be a random still image from 1 minute into the video.  Verdict: PASS (it's a book reader, not a movie player)Total Cost of Ownership.  Currently, the Tablet costs $250.  For something designed to be used on the road, you will need an extra power supply ($25) and protective cover case ($35).  The $50 extended warranty is a requirement since the Tablet will probably be dropped and crushed frequently.  To install more than a few books, documents, and media files will require an SD card ($20 - $35).  Add another $30 to purchase third-party apps to add functionality and you have around $400 invested in the Tablet.  Purchasing ebooks and emagazines is an optional ongoing expense.Final Verdict.  As much as I tried to only use built-in apps during the trial period, when I could not get the functionality I wanted from them I was able to download a number of free or inexpensive apps.  These allow me to do the basic content creation and editing I need on the road. A B&N; employee flat out admitted the Tablet was rushed out the door with only NOOK Color functionality so was not being fully exploited yet.  The firmware update proved B&N; is committed to making the Tablet live up to its promise. Realizing that no tablet can yet replace a laptop, and the functionality and ubiquity Evernote brings, convinced me to keep the Tablet.",4.0,Good ebook reader.

Initially, I was blown away by how the screen was more beautiful and livid than the Kindle.  It is silky and smooth, unlike the Kindle Fire's grainy and unpleasant, in my opinion.  Next, I explored the system's Settings and found out that the User's modifications is limited.  I was not able to install the Amazon AppStore or even SlideMe apps store since B&N took away the Unknown Sources capability.  So no Play Store, no Amazon and no SlideMe nor any other Third Party Apps.  So I am only left with B&N apps store; I call it ""The Lockdown Tablet"", no incomings or outgoings except thru B&N.  However, this tablet has some of the best hardware specs, same as Fire's, if not better.  Of course, since this Nook has 1 GHz processor, it is able to render Flash videos from websites.  But my Nook was not able to render videos from ESPN with the Nook's browser.  On the contrary, the Dolphin browser, downloaded from B&N app store, had no problems rendering videos on ESPN website.  Finally, the contents in the Nook and B&N apps store are perfect for children of all ages.  I did neither see nor find any inappropriate apps from B&N's app store.

I downloaded some of my pdf files, setup my email (disappointed with the very limited email app), got on the web (another disappointment - very basic), and then I looked at the apps selection of the B&N; store. Where's the beef? An Android device and only a few limited apps available? But then I found an option that was available to download third party apps, which made everything ok, since there are so many available online.A couple days later I discovered that an automatic update had disabled the capability of third party apps. I was beyond disappointed, now I was getting angry. An Android OS should allow you to run thousands of apps! But not with Barnes & Noble's greedy palms! The Nook became ""their"" tablet, and not mine. It was now restricted to only ""their"" apps and downloads. Period.*IF* they (B&N;) were to offer tons of apps & downloads for little or nothing, that would be acceptable. Read some of the other reviews - you'll find that the tablet is nothing more than a B&N; display device now, not a true tablet. You can't even share apps or music that was purchased for another Android device. The ONLY way you can use it for free is by viewing the supported files you can copy from your computer to the Nook (documents, pictures, songs). And if any of those files are large, it struggles to display them.There are over 50,000 Android apps available online, but none of those are available to Nook users.Since this is no longer a true Android tablet that I can use the software I want to use it has lost all it's appeal.

It lacks a camera, GPS, and bluetooth, but that still leaves a lot, between web browsing and running lots of Android apps. Barnes and Noble did cripple these with limited software through their store but I did get around that by rooting mine.That said, I was sort of surprised to see this pop up as something recommended by Amazon today. The newer version is faster, has a higher resolution screen, is lighter despite same screen size, and has bluetooth. (Still no camera or GPS). B&N; also is now allowing access to the Google Play Store. It is available on the newer version but I don't know if they updated the software for this one to allow access. I suspect they didn't but this would be something to check on if considering purchasing.If you want a tablet for web browsing, checking email, ebooks, video, and many other apps and this is as much as you want to spend, then it isn't a bad deal. I would recommend paying more for the newer version--the Nook HD. (They also make a version with a larger screen, the HD+)Also note that there are third party programs available which will allow you to boot a rooted Android system off of an SD card. This will give more options but I found the original Nook Tablet to be sluggish running off such a card--possibly because I also went to Jelly Bean and this might have been too much for the older tablet. I wound up going back to running the rooted software directly off the tablet (but rooting is more work than inserting a card).

Only has a 1024 x 600 pixel screen but from a foot away you can't tell the different between this and a device with 1200 x 800 pixels or more. Reading is a pleasure. I've had all the Kindles and all the Nooks and for the best overall reading experience the Nook is better.Why? The Nook devices feel great to hold. The plastics are soft, all the buttons are in good places, and recharging takes no time at all. Also, the software layout and navigation is easy and logical. Next, the font choices, sizes, and other personalizations are all useful. And finally, no freaking ads. You can personalize your home screen and on the Nook Touch you can select your own photos for the screen saver.What's my problem then with Kindle? Couple things. The ads of course. Also, I personally don't care for the software. You are stuck in their software with no way to personalize it. Boring! Also, the buttons are in bad places so you can accidentally shut the device off. On the lower priced Kindles the font choices are fewer and the smaller size choices are useless unless you use a magnifying glass. And the devices aren't as nice to hold. At least on the Fires they took the idea from Nook on making the backs have a soft plastic.I'm pretty sure that anyone who takes the time to try both Nook and Kindle will like the Nook better. As reading devices go they just make more sense. As far as a full fledged tablet goes you'll have to look to Apple or Samsung in my opinion.

It is also more comfortable to type on than my smart phone. The Nook easily fits into most of my purses . . . even with with the cover I purchased for it. An added bonus is that it keeps my 7-year old occupied during long drives, while shopping, or when sitting in waiting rooms for appointments.

I've got to say, it's nice.  Fonts are small, though one could choose dpi if they had visual issues (google this).  Netflix works, and the UI is really quite nice - pretty much no need for Button Savior, battery life is same as CM7.  In general I like it better than CM7.  My major hardware dislikes are headphone jack requires a little wiggling sometimes, no BT, no GPS.  Seems to charge fine with a normal cable.At this point I lean toward Samsung tablets - I like the IR and the microSD slot.===========================Update Jul 2012: I've installed Cyanogen 7, which works with button savior.  I had trouble installing from .zip booting into recovery but was able to install without a hitch using a bootable microSD card.  Fonts are sometimes a bit big, as is line spacing, but in general, CM7 frees you of the B&N; walled-ness, even as somewhat mitigated below.  Netflix doesn't work, and Google Chrome won't run on Android 2.3.  Headphone jack a bit intermittent - need to wiggle wire sometimes.===========================Original review, Dec. 2011.===========================First I give a summary, followed by the details if U are interested.  I hope people will read reviews here, as, if you say much at all on B&N;'s site, they don't post your review and don't allow you to modify it so that U can post it!:A Nook Tablet could be quite good if you only want to:-  Read ebooks purchased from B&N;-  Browse the web on a tablet-  Play a small selection of games, having to pay 3-4X normal Android/Apple pricesGet something else or modify it if U want to:-  Buy a full selection of games/apps-  Pay the same price for a game as U would on an iPhone/iPad, Android Phone buying from either the Android Marketplace or Amazon App Store.-  Play music where U can sort by artist, album, genre, etc.-  Play mpeg videos-  Watch YouTubeIf U are willing to do a bit of work, you can do all this by modifying the device.  I used it rooted with the modifications described below for 11 months, before installing Cyanogen 7.2 on it.  This is a huge improvement over rooted with the below modifications - it's essentially a normal 7"" Android tablet now.The Details:============My daughter got a Nook Tablet for Christmas 2011.  She'd been saving for an iPad (~$500) but at the rate she was saving, we took pity after a year and a half.While she does read (and so do us parents), she also wanted to use it as a music player, and a movie watching device while away from wireless in the car, on a plane, etc, and she wanted to play some games.I did my reading and we seriously considered an iPad for the family with each of our 2 kids putting in $150 or so.I read about the Kindle Fire and Nook Tablet - the Fire only had 8GB of onboard storage at the time, and no micro SD slot.  A deal-breaker.  This was pre Samsung GalaxyTab, Nexus, etc.  Since the Nook Tablet has 16GB and a micro SD slot, we went to a store to take a look.  Sales guy was good, and the device hardware shows well.  Once we got it home and were doing more reading about setup, we found the first of our issues:Issue #1: Onboard Memory========================Of the 16GB of storage, you can only place your own items in 1GB.  The rest is for B&N-purchased; content.  1GB is not enough for a music collection, or any significant amount of video.  A 32GB Class 4 micro-SD card was also in her stocking, having read about this ahead of time.Once she unwrapped it and we set it up (easy enough), annoyance #2 showed itself:Issue #2: App prices and quantity=================================2 Examples: Angry Birds and Fruit Ninja.-  BN Market: $2.99, $3.95.-  Amazon's Android Market: $0.99 (ad-free), with free ad-supported versions available-  Android Market, $0.99 for either, plus free, ad-supported versions available.-  Apple App Store, $0.99 and $0.99, plus free, ad-supported versions available.YouTube: free/pre-installed on all Android/Apple phones/tablets I know of, not available on the Nook Tablet, not in the Nook store.I didn't buy either game, but instead looked back to some of my pre-Christmas reading - U can load Amazon's Appstore without rooting the device, esp. if it's running v1.4.0 of the software.  I got that working and bought $0.99 ad-free Fruit Ninja and Angry Birds.  While I was at it, I side-loaded a few other apps by e-mailing them to myself and web-browsing to get them, and got usb drivers working on an XP laptop so I could sideload via adb over usb.I wasn't home for Christmas, but I did have my work laptop which has music on it.  I copied some over and began to use the music player....Issue #3: Built-in Music Player Limitations===========================================The built-in music player in Android is decent - has been since Android 1.5 - the first version I used.  U can, generally, sort by artist, album, etc, and the UI has dark backgrounds rather than white.  The Nook built-in music player doesn't allow sort. For this, I didn't want to buy a music player, so I went ahead and rooted the device and installed Honeycomb's (Android 3.0's) music player, which is free.  Also put the standard Android YouTube app on since I could now access the Android Market.  The problem wasn't quite solved, because changes to the SD card (adding files) weren't recognized.  I tried Winamp, Songbird and Android 4.0's music player when ICS came out.  They had the same issue.  TTPod does work - you can manually refresh at any time.  I now run Cyanogen, whose music player (modified stock android to add gesture support) works just fine.  They were aware of tablets when they wrote it.This is ironic - B&N; had to do actual work to make it much worse than using the normal android version, plus they had nice opportunities to improve on the experience of a phone due to the large screen - Cyanogen 7 Android supports gestures for music - do an arrow to the left like ""&lt;"", say, and it'll go back a track.  This would be great while driving.(Note that U can unroot by putting a copy of 1.4.0 on an SD card which, though I'm not sure, would probably allow you to return the device if U needed to).Issue #4: Built-in Video Player Limitations===========================================I'd also brought on my work laptop half a dozen videos I nabbed from our TiVos from which I stripped the commercials, saving them as mpg videos.  These wouldn't play with the built-in player.I solved this with MX Player, free version, which plays them fine. U can do this only if U've installed Amazon's App Store or rooted and can access the Android Market. People out there are selling PC software to convert videos to a format Nook Tablet can use. No need - just get another video player.  MX Player Tip: brightness control is an up/down swipe on the left hand side of the screen, volume on the right.Issue #5: UI Inflexibility==========================U can't add shortcuts to the desktop, and can't do much with the sliding apple-style bar either.  For this, I installed App Manager (tough to find a .apk to sideload using adb, so I needed rooting and then got it from Android Market).  This is a fantastic app and I don't use my GoLauncher screen much any more.Also, there's one physical button.  Standard android buttons such as menu (right-click) and back aren't always around in the UI, and holding home doesn't bring up a list of open applications as it does in carrier or stock android.  They should have put those standard 2 buttons on the device.  Update after a month rooted: use Button Savior, which gives soft buttons with a flyout.  Once in a while, you have to use NT Hidden Settings to check USB Debugging unless you use Cyanogen.  Update post Cyanogen: CM7 can have soft buttons (back, menu, home, etc) displayed all the time, if desired, and has Button Savior installed as well.Issue #6: Can only charge with their charger/cable==================================================Nothing more to say.  BlackBerries and Android phones in the house all can charge in the car or at all the computers by just connecting a cable.  It charge very slowly, even if it doesn't tell you it is, when connected to a PC because or other charger.  With some irony, B&N; has had to mail me both a charger and a cable this year due to breakage.  If they could charge with any micro-USB cable, they wouldn't have to.  Update post-Cyanogen: With Cyanogen, it charges with any micro-USB cable, though slowly unless it's the actual Nook stuff - there must be something in hardware.Issue #7: OTA update breaks all the niceness I've achieved==========================================================An OTA update, v1.4.1, will break the ability to mail yourself .apks to be used to enable non-BN apps to install and to enable debugging.  I imagine U could have done these steps while on 1.4.0 and gotten sideloading via PC/adb to work, but U can't disable OTA updates.  U can if you root, though, so I did, then used SQLite to modify a setting to only update when done manually. It'll never auto-update.  Update post-Cyanogen: irrelevant now.Goodness #1: Hardware is pretty sweet=====================================Snappy, installs apps fine, opens them quickly, videos are fairly smooth, scrolling is pretty good (but not as nice as Apple's).Screen is great from angles, clear and bright.It's lightweight and can be held easily in one hand.Speaker is pretty loud - louder than any of our phones except maybe BlackBerry.Goodness #2: the Reading Aspect===============================The reading end of the device is well-implemented, though I give Amazon's original Kindle and all subsequent ones and advantage - an order of a book on an original kindle appeared on the device in less time than it took me to back out of the purchase UI.  Doing so from the web is also very fast.  A web order using a computer of a B&N; sample appeared about an hour later, but quite snappily when done from the device.Goodness #3: Books with Videos/Sound====================================Yes, these are available on Kindle Fire and iPads. I know. I do like the talking kid's books (reminds me of a LeapFrog Tag pen, but without the ability to touch words and hear them), and the free cookbook sample had a video of making a chocolate sauce.  This is good for cooking!  U can see what each stage is supposed to look like.Goodness #4: Good if U Root it, for $250========================================When rooted, it's a nice tablet + it has the B&N; connection, and it cost $250.  It isn't an iPad (no cameras or BT), and it's half the price.  Update Nov 2012: There are now a multitude of 7"" tablets (ASUS, Samsung, Google) which get my recommendation.",1.0,Very Limited Unless You Modify It,1325462400,"01 2, 2012",Electronics,0.0

Pearson ""Wilster""","[3, 6]","After months of going back and forth, reading reviews, comparing specs, I finally settled on the Nook for the simple reason that I wanted to support B&N;, particularly after Borders went out of business.  I love bookstores and libraries and hate that they are fast becoming obsolete.Well, B&N;, in its disregard and disrespect for its customers and short-sightedness AND crew of sub-par designers is certainly hastening its demise!  Because they turn a deaf ear to consumers, and have no clue what matters to us, they are cutting their own throats.SOME SPECIFICS:1. Unlike the Kindle, it is virtually impossible to get library books on to the Nook.  I've jumped through hoops, bent over backward so far it feels like my spine will break, and spent HOURS, yes, HOURS going through the BS and I STILL can't read a library book on this @#$@#$ device!  And, no, I don't want to purchase every single book I want to read!  Particularly not at B&N;'s prices.  Amazon's books are far far far far far more reasonably priced.  For that matter, so are Sony's.  And I love and support libraries, though they, too, are sadly becoming a thing of the past.  Its too bad B&N; can't be more supportive of them.  Kindle is...2.  B&N; offers a pathetically small number of real gaming apps~all of them overpriced!!! Most of them boring, stupid and outdated.  Amazon has virtually an unlimited number of apps, nearly all of the cheaper than Nook and virtually every popular game that exists.  Most Android apps can be easily downloaded to the Kindle.  Not so with Nook.3.  Games that you can purchase from external sources like Popcap cannot be downloaded to Nook, but are easily loaded on to the Kindle.Those are just the few things that infuriate me the most (well, other than the fact that B&N; seems to have hired its idiot upper management team from the idiots over at Netflix).Finally, speaking of idiots... I feel like one for choosing to care about a store that doesn't care about me.  I should have figured out sooner that I made a mistake and taken the Nook Tablet right back and purchased Amazon's device.  Don't YOU be an idiot.  The Kindle Fire is the best device.  No question about it.  B&N; has designed this !@#!@# tablet so it won't accept apps other than its own so when it (inevitably) goes out of business, those of us who are STUCK with this soon-to-be obsolete device will end up having to purchase the Kindle anyway.

The B&N; Nook Store, unfortunately, is quite small; lacking the apps available on the Google Play store. It's dual-core 1 GHz processor is more than enough to plow through any game I've been able to throw at it. The 1 GB of RAM is also more than enough to handle anything. The battery life is also very good, lasting all day even if I play some graphics intensive games. I've never had it die on me. The bezel around the screen is one of the few issues with this amazing tablet, it tends to collect dust around the corners and if you're a bit OCD like me, that will bug the crap out of you. Also, rooting is really the only way to unlock this tablets true potential. Thankfully there are many very easy options out there if you don't know what you're doing. If you don't want to risk anything, creating a bootable MicroSD card with Cyanogenmod 7 on it makes this tablet unstoppable. There's also active development on the XDA-Forum with Cyanogenmod 10 which, as-of-right-now, runs very smoothly with infrequent issues. I bought the device shortly before the Nexus 7 was announced, with the intent of using it for testing my apps that I'm developing (I knew I would have to root it). I really regret not waiting a few more weeks to get the Nexus 7, as it is more powerful (not that it matters) and better for developers (being Google's official tablet). I have yet to get the ADB drivers to work on my computer, there seems to be an issue where it installs drivers for a USB Mass Storage device on Windows 7.Overall, an amazing tablet. Great battery life, more power than most people will ever need, the Micro SD card port is the best part over other tablets in the same market (Nexus 7, Kindle Fire, iPad Mini, etc.). If you have a lot of data (movies, books, music, etc.) this is currently the best affordable choice.",4.0,Great with exceptions,1353888000,"11 26, 2012",Electronics,1.0

Later I got an excellent deal on a Tablet & GOD I LOVE IT (now to get a custom skin & cover &lt;3)!!! Originally I bought it mainly because of the e-reader part, but I use it for all sorts of things, & I also take huge advantage of any nearby WiFi.I love that the e-reader part has all kinds of size & font settings & you can adjust screen brightness to your needs. In my case mine is set to white letters with gray/black background & max brightness. Everything is very bright & easy to see & read. I also like the fact that, in the long run, I read a lot so hopefully this saves a few trees :). Granted not every book I want is currently purchasable in E-book form, but there already quite a few books (OK at least 1 or 2 hundred :P ) in my Wishlist. Purchases are easy & I like the double check feature because im the queen of accidental touch screen tapping :). Plus since I do animal rescue & am on a low LOW budget usually there are quite a few good free books as well & an app you can download that helps you find some good free, low cost, & top pick books :).WiFi & otherwise im still getting used to some websites having phone app settings, which ill admit im not all that fond of, but other than that I couldnt be happier! Pages are also easy to see & manage, though a few times Ive overloaded the poor thing which has required a force close :(. Pretty sure thats my bad though. This also happened twice in e-reader mode. I tap too many things at once too fast.In general I wasnt using mine too much at first because I was terrified that Id drop it & or ruin the screen. Since then Ive bought screen covers & use it a LOT more :P. Settings are easy to work with & even the pictures ive added to the ""My Media"" folder are bright & clear. I take online classes, & since most of my tests are multiple choice I find test taking easier & faster on my NOOK. My only complaint overall is that I use some of those pics as wallpaper & since they need to be stretched out for the home page it makes them blurry up close/enlarged. I dont mind that much though. Ive gotten used to it, & not all of the pics turn out blurry if set as wallpaper. Overall I am BEYOND satisfied with my NOOK Tablet, & I HIGHLY recommend it! Long live the NOOK!!!",5.0,Best. Tablet.

Recentley i purchased a tablet and really enjoyed that you could read books with a backlight and in color, beacause of that i went on the hunt for a color ebook. Now when Barnes and Noble started to come out with their ebooks I did not like them, I didnt like the desgin, when i would mess with them at Barnes and Nobel they just seemed redundant and to annoying to work with.  So When the Nook HD came out i researched and fell in love, I am soo happy i made this purchase.  I did not buy it from amazon as my local Kmart had it for 199.00 and you were able to put it in lay-a-way.  Some of the features this product needed to have were expandable memory, and screen functions to turn down backlight and make font bigger when needed. The screen resolution on this item in really nice, the touch screen is super responsive and the quality of the reading and easyness of use makes this an everyone can use product.  It is called a tablet and can be used that way, as you can get on the internet, access email, and also watch netflix if you choose but i wanted a color ebook not a smaller tablet so i really cant tell you how well it works as a tablet. I can tell you if you are looking for a good color Ereader this is the one i would recomend, like i said it is easy to use litteraly two pushes to open a book or access library page flipping is easy and controlls to make fonts larger or smaller, change paper color, even change font appearence are easy.  Also Barnes and Noble stores books on the cloud network for you when you take them off of you shelf. Magazines are interactive, and picture books for children are vibrant and enjoyable.  You can add up to 32gb of extra memory in micro miny memory card slot and the battery i have found if you turn off wifi can last you up to 2-3 weeks.  My sony lasted me about 1-2 months on a single charge so the two to three weeks is not that bad for me.

I decided it was time to upgrade my original Nook and went with this tablet. I purchased mine direct from B&N. This is a fantastic ereader with a few tablet functions. I really like the interface on this ereader more so than the Kindle Fire. Don't get me wrong, the Kindle Fire is a very nice device, but I like the personal touch I can give the Nook HD. It's more customizable.I can create my own wallpaper and customize my home screen. The ereader is very light and easy to hold with a contoured, grippy back. The screen resolution is fantastic! Even small print is readable. The colors in magazines is exceptional and the scrapbook feature is an innovative touch. I really appreciate having a physical home button, and external volume rockers & power button. The interface is very user friendly and aesthetically pleasing. Setting up email was a snap and customizing my security settings from lock screen passwords to shopping passwords is much appreciated. Web browsing is very zippy on this device. More zippy than the Kindle Fire. Ereading is also a pleasure, with customizable fonts & backgrounds. I was surprised at how well I was able to read on it outside in the shade. It still has a lot of glare, but it is much more readable than the Ipad or the Kindle Fire.I can't see the Ipad or Kindle Fire screen at all outside with all the glare. Nook HD is NOT as readable as an eink screen, so I will be keeping my original Nook of 3 years for outdoor reading. But for a tablet ereader, I was really surprised at how well it did outside in the shade. I have since given my husband the Ipad 2, as I like the 7"" form factor of the ereader/tablet devices. I take them with me everywhere. If you were to ask me which I liked better, the Kindle Fire or the Nook HD...well...I wouldn't be able to choose. Amazon has a larger store for books, apps, movies etc....but I like B&N's Nook HD for it's interface, superb screen and customizable home screen. It also has expandable memory, and you can sideload epub books. I also like the look of the Nook HD better.

It is NOT a tablet, it's a reader. If you want a true tablet, just spend the extra $100 and get the iPad Mini.We got this around Christmas time, thinking it would be a great tablet for the whole family to use. We were so wrong.While the display is crisp, everything else sucks and it is not user friendly at all. I can't understand why some people gave this thing high ratings - the only explanation would be that they have never held an Apple product in their hands...For start, the browser is the most frustrating browser out there - terrible. Even those we installed were terrible. It keeps freezing all the time and everything takes forever.Then the sensitivity of the touch screen is awful which will make you want to pull your hair out while using the browser, not even comparable to the browser sensitivity and intelligence on iPhones and iPads, not even close!The profiles don't work - we set 3 profiles - one for me, one for my husband and one for our son who is 2.5. One would think that in my profile I will see my stuff. Wrong! Once I go to my profile after my husband had been using the tablet, open the browser - I don't see my tabs, I see all of my husband's tabs he was just viewing like NFL stuff and all my tabs from when I used it are gone. My twitter account is gone - I see my husband's twitter so I manually have to sign him out and then sign myself in... What's the point of the profiles when they simply do not work!?!?And the apps, of course, cannot be compared to those available at the Apple Store. It's a joke! Tiny selection of kids movies and kids apps and the kids apps are so poorly made and so terrible, my son was not interested at all. I had to show him so many times how to use them yet he still struggled and was not interested. He'd rather play with the apps on my iPhone and I didn't even show him how to use them. Apple is just so intuitive and so easy to use.There's no Facebook app (maybe they added it by now - I hope!), no Pinterest app, no Etsy app, no eBay app, no PayPal app... I can go on and on and on...And then of course, this thing doesn't have a camera. It kills me when I see commercials for Kindles and Nooks and they have their tablet next to the iPad Mini and say that everything on these tablets is the same, except for the price. Yes, the iPad Mini costs an extra $100, but it has a camera so you can make pictures and videos and skype on it. It also has a lot more apps and a bigger screen! (almost 8""). So there you go, spend that extra $100 and get the iPad Mini, you get what you pay for. Unless, of course, you want to use your Nook HD just for reading books and watching movies because that's exactly what Nook HD is - a reader & a movie viewer.One more thing - B&N; customer service sucks!

The screen resolution was great, but the Android OS IceCream Sandwich was slow, cumbersome and basically not well thought out + the speaker volume was really low coupled with Adobe reader being super slow and note taking in Adobe Reader was also painful often causing the app to lock up or freeze, so I was extremely disappointed with the purchase that I made last fall at B&N; for $175. So, I started comparing the Nook to Nexus 7"" and thought what the heck - sell it and buy a used Nexus on Ebay -But, I came across some articles talking about ROOTED Nooks and the possibility of having them go to a full Android tablet, but this too sounded complicated, and after all, I just wanted to use my device like my wife's Ipad Mini - Well after doing a little more research found this website N2A which had Jellybean OS 4.1.2 for download $19.99 - I paid for that - and thought wow what a nice difference for my NOOK HD, Now moving forward several months - I thought, I was going to keep it at 4.1.2, but my BlueTooth only worked so, so and the Wifi was not as snappy as I wanted it to be - Once again I decided what the heck, so as of this early week, I took the plunge and moved it to Android 4.2.2 for $9.99 more on the AFN Website (Android for NOOK, I thought what the heck, 10 bucks more and what can it hurt)...WOW with the 4.2.2 upgrade it is absolutely stellar - I mean it is fantastico - Snappy and fast, honest, and BlueTooth and WiFi are much, much faster with 4.2.2 - AND The Volume, yes the Volume finally is loud enough and I even have to now turn it down - Can you believe it folks, Watching TV, Movies internet Videos are now actually enjoyable - Check out my review for Android for NOOK (AFN) here on Amazon...  and my review for the Minisuite stand and case+keyboard...OH but this is supposed to be a review about the NOOK HD 7"" 16GB, right! Right! -As far as the Nook itself, it is still the best thing out price point wise, Honest,  they are so much cheaper than a lot of Android Tablets, and a lot cheaper then an Ipad Mini or even a used Ipad Mini -The Nook looks great for watching movies, surfing the web, doing my homework reading for grad school, and rivals my wife's Ipad mini any day of the week when it comes to movies on Netflix. Now, I type notes from class on my nook - read, do everything on it -Again much of this can be attributed to Jellybean OS 4.2.2 - I love reading books on my Nook, and I really appreciate the outside cover of the Nook HD (some thought went into this, plastic kinda rubber cover, that works great). I throw this thing everywhere, on the couch, then bounces and hits the floor, it has even dropped out of my hands or off the kitchen counter with no damage at all -Look, I don't need a camera on my tablet - That's not why I bought my nook originally, I bought to watch movies on in bed with the wife and TV episodes on Netflix - I now use it several times a week as a reader and note taker for homework. So, what are you waiting for, go out and buy a nook HD 7"" or 9"" - they are wicked cheap new, and close to Ebay prices, if the ebay thing is not for you - and have some Jellybeans too.Now remember - I can go back to my lame B&N; original OS if I want to, just by taking the micro SD card out , but of course, I won't -Only if BARNES AND NOBLE WOULD UPDATE THEIR NOOKS TO JELLYBEAN 4.2.2 the world would be a much better place. What, the What B&N;!!! Why won't you guys have an update for JellyBean on the NOOK? Why I ask, Why?In the end I might even buy a Nook HD+ on ebay and obviously throw some Jellybeans on that too - because they are so wicked cheap on Ebay right now, and because you have tons of people just simply selling theirs...I hope this helped some current nook owners - and future ones -",5.0,Don't give up on your NOOK HD just yet - make it a Lean Mean Jellybean with OS 4.2.2,1386806400,"12 12, 2013",Electronics,1.0

Called tech support 3 times, they were helpful and courteous, but we could not solve that problem.  Finally tech support asked me if I had inserted a miniSD card, I had.  They told me to check to see if that it was corrupted, it was.  Re-formatting that card solved WIFI problem, although just why it was causing this problem is still a mystery to me.  If you have problems with your NOOK, and you are not able to solve them, and you have inserted a MiniSD card, try re-formatting it.I have an Apple IPAD, I bought the NOOK to help me learn and understand ANDROID.  I find ANDROID substantially less user friendly, and the apps cost more and do not work as well.  More importantly, at least to me, is the fact that there are at least a  dozen  apps that I use all the time that have no equivalent in ANDROID.

With the way I use it, the battery life lasts for several days of reading and browsing the web. Magazines on this screen are amazing, I especially like reading Time because of the outstanding photography they do. Books look great, and the selection of games on the Barnes and Noble store is alright. A little annoying paying again for games I already bought on my phone, but that's not so bad.Further, you really don't need to pay again for games if you install a custom ROM on an SD card. You can either purchase one premade (google for N2A for more info) or you can burn your own if you google a little more and spend the afternoon trying different things. It's not scary at all, especially since you're only doing stuff on the SD card not the tablet itself. If you want to undo it, just take the card out! Anyway, the custom ROM just gets you stock android, and that opens this great device up to the full android market of games and apps. You can still read all your Barnes and Noble stuff on the B&N; android app. I read my Wired subscription that way, as well as some books. Anyway, I think this device and the ROM on the SD card is the best of B&N; and android.Anyway, I'd compare this with the Google Nexus 7. The nook has a slightly higher resolution screen, which is kinda neat especially for magazines. No front facing camera on the nook, but my phone already is great for video chat so I don't miss it. Also, the custom ROM I put on my SD card is android 4.2, whereas google says the Nexus is android 4.1...maybe they'll get an update soon I don't know. So, either way, you probably can't lose.EDIT: Barnes and Noble opened up the stock software to be able to use almost all of the apps in the google play store.

CPU speed is a good mid-range also.PROS:+Full 1080P - 9"" display that really shows good images (movies and games look great on it)+Access to the Google Play Store (Amazon should take note)+MicroSD slot, up to 64GB card (I will in the near future put a bootable Android version on it)+Easy to copy my eBooks (or other files) from my home computer using ASTRO File ManagerCONS:-No cameras (I wouldn't use it for photos, but video conferencing would have been nice).-No GPS (although if you turn on Google's Location Service it can get pretty close).-Proprietary USB charging port, makes it difficult to always keep it charged because you don't always carry the charging cable with you (and extra charging cables for the NOOK HD+ are expensive).-No sensor for ambient light to allow automatic screen brightness (this bothers me more than I thought it would).-WiFi connections can be flaky sometimes, but if you turn off the NOOK WiFi and turn it back on it seems to clear it up.-Mono speaker, but when stereo matters I am usually using headphones.-NOOK Profiles (up to 6), I thought this would be a PRO but their implementation only seems to give different 'tabletops', each user still uses the same programs and settings (such as the same screen unlock password), so my Jetpack Joyride game is the same as my kids and they keep spending my coins! ... :-/-The screen is a fingerprint magnet (a screen protector should help this).-Can't load apps from 'Unknown Sources,' this is a pain because I have some apps I bought on the Amazon App Store and I can't load them.All-in-all I like it for what I got it for, some of its shortcomings are easily overlooked since I have a phone that can do the cameras and GPS.Worth the $150.",4.0,"Not The Best, But Worth $150",1384214400,"11 12, 2013",Electronics,1.0

The instruction set is barely nuts and bolts but it gives one the essentials.It passed the back pocket test famously. This was done straightaway. Was very pleased with this feature.But buyer beware. I discovered this Nook tablet has no camera at all. Who ever heard of such a thing? There is a reasonable expectation.The Nook downloaded and upgraded itself famously. Everything was smooth and cheerful.The speed of the Nook was very good in my opinion. Page to page was smooth and cheerful and moderately fast. The book pages are easy to read. Another Dan Brown book (I think). Made the discovery with Inferno. Played/watched Linux Action Show and other video for about 3 hours with about 15% of the battery power left.Checked YouTube and Amazon to see the how the graphic's engine worked in the Nook. The motion pictures were crisp and clear on YouTube and Amazon. The sound was very excellent and voluminous much to my surprise. Can hear the device clearly and with ease even though I am kinda hard of hearing. The movie scenes moved like a big computer rendering of the graphics. The motion pictures were like a TV broadcast. Not kidding.Now the ultimate bummer: their much touted microSDHC card can not play your own content downloaded from a computer. Later, several hours later there was an additional patch of 75 upgrades that made the microSDHC capable of playing video files/movies. The selection it can play is very limited compared to other more recent operating systems in Android devices. The latest Android operating system is 4.4 KitKat. The Nook will not play certain AVI or HD files. It is very persnickety  What the Nook can play is rendered exceptionally well indeed. It can only play things downloaded from Nooks libraries for sale-wrong as mentioned. I would have never bought this dohickey if I knew thee was no camera natively in advance.One always takes for granted a camera. And their microSDHC is nothing short of a rip-off. Jeez- wrong now.My Chinese Brand X tablets can play my media content in AVI. MP3/4 and other popular media formats very well indeed. These Brand X tablets can play far more movie/video files than the Nook. Their Android versions are newer than the Nook's.The back pocket thing was a real plus. Great sound. Great graphics. Good speed.But these pluses can not counter balance the negatives. The camera is not as important as real robust motion graphics and awesome sound to me. Now I am thinking I will keep this Nook because it does have a viable if not bugged up microSDHC card port capable of music and motion picture replay. Forget file sharing in Android.B&N; needs a No Brainer award for greed and stupidity just like Apple, Kindle and Nexus. Apple, Kindle and Nexus deserve the No-Brainer award more because the Nook's microSDHC does work but has limited compatibility with the files/apps that can play these type of music and movie files.Now I have to go through the hassle of returning this thingamajig. May keep this on the hope there will be patches further to play music and movie files.If you need a camera don't buy this.",2.0,B&N Nook 16 Gbs Tablet Has No Camera Can Play Limited Selection of Video on microSDHC,1388534400,"01 1, 2014",Electronics,0.0

I have the 9"" one, so have moved the review over here.  Some things have been brought to my attention since that have prompted this edit.  I bought this device because the large screen, the sharp display, the expandable memory and the light weight were all attractive.  Prior to buying this Nook I had a Sylvania SYTAB7MX.  I had bought it to get a feel for how tablets operate.  It had limited capability, but it was cheap and served me well for about a year.  Since it was only running Android 2.0 I was excluded from a lot of apps.  I finally decided to update to the Nook.  I had several unpleasant surprises and one pleasant one.1. I found that there is no way to be rid of numerous crapplications that come on the Nook and take up memory that could be better used elsewhere.  The Sylvania had fewer of them and there was a way to remove unwanted ones there.2. I am a member of Amazon Prime and was looking forward to viewing movies on this device due to its large screen and very good graphics.  When I logged into Amazon and selected a movie to view I got this: ""Amazon Instant Video uses Adobe Flash.  We can take you to the Adobe website where you can quickly install the latest free version of the Flash.""  Sure.  I'd go for that.  So I went to the Adobe site and got this: ""We're sorry.  This content requires Adobe Flash Player, which is not supported by your device...""Now, thanks to a comment by Torrey Pines on my earlier review, I have learned that there is a workaround.  It requires first using Google Play on the Nook to download and install the Firefox browser application.  Then go to [...] and download and install the ""browser plugin"" application.  Although it is called a browser plugin, it comes from Adobe and is a Flash plugin.  This website downloaded the app to my library but did not install it.  I contacted Barnes and Noble support and learned that I just had to turn the device off, turn it back on and click on the browser plugin icon on the start screen and it will install.  I contacted support through this page: [...]  You send them your phone number by e-mail and someone from support will call you back.  I got called back in less than a minute.  I found this impressive.For some reason, the browser plugin will not work with the Chrome browser that is supplied on the Nook HD+.  After you install Firefox and the browser plugin and select a video to play it will first ask you if you want to use Chrome or Firefox.  You must select Firefox.  Then a gray screen will come up with a single icon in the middle with the usual ""Play"" icon.  Underneath it says to select that icon to activate the plugin browser.  Videos then play nicely.  Volume is less that when playing Netflix (which does not use the browser plugin but does require the Netflix app), but adequate.3. The Barnes and Noble web site says that this Nook has ""dual stereo speakers"".  I doubt this is true, but if it is, they ""speak"" out of a perforated area of the case measuring about 1.5"" x .5"" - hardly my idea of stereo.  The sound is clear and clean, however.4. My wife's Galaxy Tab has a way to override the limitation on whose apps you can download.  As far as I can see, there is no way to do this on the Nook HD+.The positive surprise was that I discovered the Nook has a nifty voice-command capability.I am amazed that, in spite of having spent two hours reading reviews on the Amazon and Walmart and on two sites that specialize in tablet reviews prior to purchasing it, I found nothing to suggest most of the problems I found with this device.  Having read some more reviews since first having published this review, the only place I have seen that would have tipped me off to the inability of the native Nook to play Flash video was on the site for Amazon instant video where they list the capable devices.I found reviewers who say the Nook HD+ only has one speaker, but the B&N; site says stereo.

I added a 16gb sd card filled with thousands of my favorite songs. But, the Nook is designed to be an ereader...it is not a games tablet, or an IPad.I got my Nook Tablet (8gb version) from Barnes & Noble because of the extra discount I got with my B&N; membership...the price was MUCH less than advertised by most internet venders. I already have a Brand X color e-reader and a Nook Simple Touch reader. My old color reader was hard on my eyes for long reading sessions, the Nook Touch is great for books, but it does not have internet access or play music and magazines don't really work without a color screen.The Nook tablet has very sharp, clear, and contrasty fonts and is very pleasant to read, even for several hours. There is a night mode, and also a sephia mode for reading in bed without bothering anyone else. Magazines look great on its color screen. I listen to music on Pandora while I read, and when I am tired of reading, I can watch a movie on Netflix or a tv show on TV.com. I installed the Dolphin browser which uses tabs so I can switch quickly among various web pages.Vevo music videos look great, but the Nook's speaker is too weak to enjoy music. However, music sounds great through good ear buds and when I plug the Nook into my computer speakers.The Nook is an e-reader, NOT an I-Pad or high powered tablet. It does not have access to Google Play to obtain apps, so you are limited to the apps in the Nook app store. Those apps have been developed just for the Nook and its seven inch screen. The apps in Google Play are mostly designed for the smaller screens of cell phones, while Nook apps are designed just for the Nook.Bottom line: the Nook Tablet 8gb is a terrific way to read books and magazines while enjoying your favorite music (I loaded a 16gb memory card with thousands of my favorite songs...transferring the songs over to the Nook from my laptop was fast and easy).For folks who want the ""full"" tablet experience, Amazon.com sells the N2A card which enables you to boot your Nook into a full tablet mode, with access to Google Play, and the 400,000 apps available there. And, the N2A card also permits booting the Nook back into its original Nook settings, as the card does not modify any of the Nook's software or settings.",5.0,Great Color E-Reader With Extra Features,1334102400,"04 11, 2012",Electronics,1.0

The software and usability is noticeably different though, and that's where you should pay close attention.  I bought my wife the Nook Tablet for Christmas and she uses it a fair amount.  I haven't heard any major complaints from her but here are the ones I've heard most often.The Barnes and Noble App Store is a joke.  I looked through it for about 5 minutes and barely ever saw a free app.  Many popular apps and games are there, but usually you can only get the paid version.  Adding insult to injury, side-loading is difficult if not impossible without rooting the device (this will void the warranty).  I didn't expect side-loading to be a given really, but if you block those apps you really need a decent App Store to make up for it.The SD card slot, which many people may not ever use, is in a pretty odd spot.  It's not really hard to pry back the cover but since you're working with a micro-SD card it can be really annoying to  line up such a tiny card in the slot.  If that wasn't annoying, it is definitely annoying to load your PDFs or whatever from the SD card once its inserted.  For someone who isn't really tech-savvy it isn't obvious how to read those files.  The reader app could really do a better job of detecting documents when the SD card is inserted.On the aesthetic side the launcher could use some work.  Although I think the scrolling app dock at the bottom is slightly more elegant than a grid-like app drawer, there's little organization to the home screen.  You can drag icons around, to and from the dock, but apps/books don't lock to any kind of grid on the home screen.  Some of us who are more anal retentive just won't stand for two icons being less than parallel.  You can see a better view of your media by opening the Library app, which is a nice app, but I find the contrast displeasing, further emphasizing this is a tablet with e-reader functions (or vice versa maybe).  Basically the cohesion isn't there and you start to wonder, with all of the restrictions, why you didn't just get a regular tablet.I still haven't rooted my wife's tablet but maybe if something annoys her enough she'll let me do it.  Otherwise, if you're not planning to root the NOOK, beware of its restrictions and browse its App Store for a bit to see if the selection and prices are a deal-breaker.  This is an e-reader FIRST and a tablet SECOND.  If you're satisfied with its e-reader capabilities I'm sure you'll be happy with this device.",3.0,Know What You're Buying,1338854400,"06 5, 2012",Electronics,0.0

So I was looking for a 7"" android tablet under $200. The best options was Kindle Fire and B&N's Nook Tablet 8gb. I Went to Best Buy to check the two devices. The screen resolution seemed better in NookT. I was annoyed with their limitation on Android App market (Now Google Play). You can only install App from their Very Very limited App stores (Amazon or B&N). In most cases apps that are free in Google market are not free in Amazon/B&N stores. A big turn off. I started looking for reviews on the internet and found some ways to root the device to install google play and enjoy free apps. Did I root my Nook tablet? I won't say. I leave to the imagination of the reviewers of this review. Apart from the app market, Nook tablet looks more elegant than kindle fire, you can add up to 32 gb extra storage space to the device. If I had spent another 50 dollars I could get the 16 gb Nook Tablet, which is faster than the 8gb model. The battery seems to last shorter than my iPad1 battery probably because of the smaller battery.

If your primary interest is books, this will be an excellent choice.This particular Nook occupies an interesting middle ground, so pick and choose carefully what you want and what you will use. I will try and break things down so you can make the best decision.If you ONLY want to read books, the level down from this nook is a better choice. The true eReader nook which has the actual ""e-ink"" display is the best choice if you ONLY want books. The battery life on the smaller Nooks is longer and the screen is even easier on the eyes as it is optimized for reading only.At the other extreme are people who really want something more like a tablet. If you want something  that has access to apps and also works with books, but you're not a voracious reader, you should go with either the bigger HD version of the Nook or a Kindle Fire HDThis Nook sits neatly in the middle. It's batter life is very good (but nothing close to as good as the pure eReader version) and when setup to emulate ink and paper the display is easy on the eyes (but not as good as a pure eReader). This Nook also has access to some limited apps like Pandora, Hulu and Netflix. Note - the app availability is VERY limited. I think calling this nook a ""tablet"" as it is in the product description is a bit misleading. The Nook OS is very tied town and restricted, so remember that. You will not be getting access to the android/google play store with this product. You have Barnes and Nobles limited app store only. So on the ""tablet"" front, this Nook is not as good as a Kindle Fire (But it is a better eReader).So, you just need to decide if you want:an eReader that also does a few extra things which is nice (this Nook wifi)A tablet that's also a bit of an eReader (Kindle Fire HD or upgraded Nook version)Just an eReader (the basic, no color screen Nook)Any of these products are very good, but you need to know what you want to do with it to get the best thing for you.",4.0,Probably the best eReader on the market if you want to occasionally do something else too,1388102400,"12 27, 2013",Electronics,1.0

It has a great price, the screen is good and the colors look great on it, but there are two major issues that I have with this tablet that keep it from being truly great.My first issue that I have with it is that the OS/Nook Software that it comes with is extremely limited.  I bought this for my daughter last Christmas and I was sorely disappointed to see that a lot of the apps/games that she wanted either were not available at all or had a price attached to them through the B&N; store.  These are the same games you can get for free through the Google Play store.  I was pretty mystified to say the least.My next issue, and perhaps the biggest issue I have, is their charger.  It's a proprietary charger (not your standard USB universal charger) and it SUCKS.  It's the worst thing I've ever seen.  It's cheap/flimsy and I've had to replace it numerous times because the prong is extremely weak/fragile.  There's not even a good after-market charger that you can buy to rectify the situation.  All of the chargers that I've seen (whether it be through B&N; or after-market) are crap and it's only a matter of time before you'll have to replace them.  At $10 a pop (through B&N;), this can add up.I was able to solve the first problem by rooting the tablet to run Android and get the Google Play store, but sadly there's no fix to the 2nd problem and that problem can bleed your wallet over time.I really want to like this tablet because I feel like it's a great budget tablet, but when you look at the hidden costs (rooting + chargers) I'd almost be inclined to pay a little extra for something like a Kindle.In sum, it's not bad once you overcome the OS problem, but the charger will keep it from being great.

If you already are loaded with Kindle books, B&N; foolishly doesn't have a Kindle app, but you can, on Amazon or n2a.com buy an n2a card which allows you to boot your Nook up as a full Android complete with access to the Android Market (or whatever Google is calling it now), and get the Kindle app to accress all your Kindle books.  Since I love the design of the eReader  on the Nook, I use my n2a card only when I want a Kindle book.  I find the B&N; Nook books are usually the same price as Kindle.  Occasionally, Kindle doesn't have a book I want but Nook does.  Also, Nook may not have a book Kindle has.  Also, Nook books have the page perfect series, as well as Enhanced Editions with embedded videos and audio clips, neither of which Kindle has.The Nook has a tab for ""My Stuff"" so you can drag things from your PC to the Nook.  If you want more space for your stuff, you can get any sized san disk for the Nook.  I have a 32 gb one because I transferred about 4,000 pictures to my Nook and am using an app to edit the pictures and then make slide shows of them. Then I'll drag the shows back onto my computer and burn them to disc. Did I mention the Nook is a joy to use?

Amazon or B*N this is unethical!D.F.---------------Nook HD overviewGreat screen, no cameras, weak speakers, crappy battery life, compromised android OS, but an inexpensive way to browse web and run the world of android apps on a fast, beautiful display. Plus it has a microSD slot to hold lots of videos for offline viewing. And of course, its original purpose, to provide a slick interface for purchase and reading of magazines and books.PlusesWide range of browers available. I have 9 on my machine. All browsers for tablets have reduced functionality so some browsers are better than others for specific tasks. For example, Firefox will play video in HD and does not redirect to mobile sites. Tint and Zirco have a homepage that will access a local html file. With several browsers installed it's easier to get around site restrictions. Firefox has an addon that auto-deletes cookies. Chrome allows spoken search inputs.The world of 700,000 android apps can now be accessed on Nook HD including big and nice apps: Google earth, Skype, YouTube in HD, Adobe Reader, WiFi Analyzer, WiFi Fixer (essential Wifi tool), Google maps, best solitaire ever (by MobilityWare), and free 'run' games. Custom moving backgrounds on Nook HD home screens are fun.AnnoyancesIn two months I have not figured out how to add a browser link to Nook HD home page. Some browsers have the option to add a link to the homepage, but it never works! (It must be that the Nook HD OS does not allow this)Poor battery life, by test I get only 4 hours.Adroid apps normally just suspend, so it tends to take too many presses and taps to cleanly start an application.Audio does not shut off when you exit most radio and music apps. With no OS support for shutting apps down I often have to resort to a reset to silence them.Built-in email has a short time window so you only see few or no messages. Apps like FastHotMail can provide workaround.Screen capture is clumsy (pushing Home and Vol- requires a lot of force and nearly simultaneous pushes).Nook HD not really useful for music, sans headphones, because sound volume on speakers is relatively low.Setting up icons on home screens is kind of a pain. Half of the main screen is taken up by a carousel that cannot be removed. The Nook recommended way of moving an icon to an adjacent screen is to hold icon overlapping the edge, but I find this hit or miss, it only seems reliable after a reset.File directories can be accessed via USB, but have some annoyances: Many file managers have a hard time finding personal files lost in a maze of OS directories. Nook HD allows deletion of its standard user directories (like 'kids B&N; files') only to later write them back again.Tablet does not reliably remember some settings. Occasionally I find the screen will be dim or the notification is too loud and when I look the setting has changed.No way (that I have found) to add personal data for quick entry.(update)Bluetooth keyboard problem solvedI have an inexpensive bluetooth keyboard that works fine with another tablet (Blackberry Playbook), but I could not get it to work with Nook HD. It would pair fine, but nothing happened when keys are hit. I see others complaining of this too. Finally I solved the problem with an app called BlueInput (available on Play Store). It now does the pairing, not Nook OS, and you select the bluetooth keyboard using 'Switch Keyboard' icon.(update)Fix for adding web link icons to the home page. Some browsers have the option to add a bookmark to Home, but this never seemed to work in Nook HD. I think I now understand the source of the problem. The default Nook HD launcher (with carousel) ignores them. The work around is to install the Nova launcher, and it will show them on the home screens.",3.0,"Cheap way to browse web and run android apps on a fast, beautiful display",1374796800,"07 26, 2013",Electronics,0.0

The web may be a little, very little bit slow, but that goes with most tablets; even the ipad. It plays youtube smoothly, has good screen quality, has email, and other web related things like netflix and pandora. This tablet's speaker quality is ok, but not if you're often working in a loud place.If you want a tablet for apps: Look elsewhere. This tablet, although is great for web quality, has a poor app selection. Some of the best ones, in my opinion it has are Temple Run Brave, Fruit Ninja, and several angry bird games, however according to buyers who have had the device longer, it took a long time for even those to come out. (I could be wrong; got that peice of info off other reviews)If you just want to read and have a little of everything above: Then this is perfect. If you're not so much into the web, not too crazy about apps, but still want it as a backup as you read, then this tablet is your type. It's simple, cute, and does well with it's tasks. Nice book selection; had everyone i searched forIn General:-There are no cameras, neither front or back, but if you don't do skype and don't really care about photos, it wont make a difference.-The apps and books they have are very expensive!I've seen nook apps (nook apps in general; all nooks)shockingly expensive while other tablets such as the kindle fire has those same apps for free-You can modify the brightness when you read books, and you can bookmark them as well.Overall, this simple tablet is for those who don't really care about apps. It does everything else quite well! Would probably make a nice gift for parents who enjoy reading but are kind of hectic (all their books in one place; the nook itself), or a young child who doesn't mind not having all the, ""cool"" apps.

Well for the reading part, the Nook worked great as long as you were getting books from B&N.; Trying to get e-books from Amazon was not an option. The available apps from the Nook store were very limited compared to Amazon and Google Play store as well. And using this Nook for web browsing or purchasing music was a joke. I had a Kindle and swapped with my Wife as she wanted all the Amazon access and I like to tinker.I purchased a Android For Nook (AFN) card and went through the rooting process which was easy for people who can read direction and program clocks on VCR's. This improved the Nook from a glorified e-book reader to a full fledged Android Tablet. The version of Android (CyanogenMod) used is Gingerbread which is very stable. Not cutting edge but worlds better than the B&N; operating system. I was able to add both Nook and Amazon Kindle apps for reading as well as opening a world of apps from Google Play. The tablet is mostly used for games and movies for the kids, which both work quite well with the Nook now. Infact I would rank the Nook with the AFN modification as a better overall tablet then the Kindle since it provides for addition storage (up to 32gb) and is very easy to root. My biggest complaint left (same as the Kindle) is a lack of camera, gps, and bluetooth.In stock form, this tablet is a 2 star product because of the crapware Nook OS.

I'll explain why I went with a Nook Tablet over a Kindle Fire and why I think most people may (or may not) want to do the same thing.Note: In the interst of comparing similarly priced models, I'll compare the 8GB Nook Tablet with the 8GB Kindle Fire which are currently the same price.Hardware:Nook hardware is better than Kindle hardware. The Nook has an internal microphone and an expansion slot for a MicroSD card. Expandable memory is a huge deal. The Kindle Fire does have the old ""Gorilla Glass"", but that's a minor point. The Nook also has more glare-resistant glass. The ergonomics of the Nook are better as well.Software:Nook software is draconian. The operating system is a neutered version of the Android OS and the Google Market is off-limits. The software library is very small and almost nothing is free. This isn't necessarily as bad as it sounds at first though. If you have the technical know-how, you can replace the factory software on the Nook with an alternative OS like Cyanogen Mod. The easiest way to do this is via a specially programmed MicroSD card (which would require that you spend the money on the extra card), although you can also do this by overwriting the internal software as well (note that this IS undoable).My Recommendation:I encourage you to put a 3rd party OS on the device regardless of whether you get a Nook or a Kindle Fire. Either way, by replacing the OS you can read both B&N; Books and Kindle books on the same device (as well as use most of the other standard Google Market apps). If you are ambitious enough and feel like you have the skill, get a Nook to mod. If you plan on using the device out-of-the-box with no changes, get a Kindle Fire instead.Other thoughts:I'm really disappointed in B&N; for locking down the device so much. When it was first released, the device supported ""side-loading"" where you could install apps via MicroSD card. However, a subsequent ""update"" removed the capability without adding any significant features. It was obvious B&N; was simply trying to lock down the device further, not actually provide any sort of performance, reliability, or feature enhancements. In fact, this kind of ""update"" was actually a big step backwards. I've heard rumors that Google will soon be developing their own tablet. Based on their open philosophy that they've demonstrated in the past, I don't anticipate their OS will be locked down on that device. If the rumors are true, my next e-Reader will be from Google.Disclosure:I do not own a Kindle Fire so all of my comments on that device are based on reviews I have read and research I have performed.",3.0,Customization Required,1338768000,"06 4, 2012",Electronics,0.0

The device comes with one year warranty, I took it to the store and they replaced it in 5 minutes, again, the store experience was great.Pros:1- The device look and feel is good, design is sleek and smooth.2- Touch screen is a good idea, I have tendinitis so I prefer to use touch screen over keyboard.3- The page turn keys are in good place, very comfortable to read and hold at the same time.4- Found many books on the library search, it has detailed editorial and user reviews, with ratings, just like Amazon site.5- The format is not proprietary, this was a huge sale point for me, there are other devices that can read the same format.6- Battery is replaceable and memory SD slot is available.Cons:1- The touch screen is sluggish, you need to use it slower than using other touch devices, this is either buggy hardware or CPU is too slow.2- First device I got was defective, not a good sign, hopefully the second one is better.3- Browsing the web is ok, but using the small touch screen to navigate through HTML is not an easy task, especially since it is sluggish.4- Not all books are available in the on-line library, I found a psychology book in the store that did not exist for download.5- You need to use screw driver to open the back cover and replace battery or insert SD card.6- Little bit heavy, certainly heavier than a medium size hard cover book.",4.0,So far so good..,1284768000,"09 18, 2010",Electronics,1.0

One of the most important feature I found on the new nook was better page turn response. The screen refresh when moving from page to page is much quicker, nearly matching the refresh rates of the latest Kindle. The Nook also added a laundry list of interface and usability improvements, such as the ability to organize your book collection by category which is called ""shelves"".I liked 600 X 800 display screen. It comes with 16 shades of gray and is easy to your eyes. I can read all day without hurting my eyes. My personal opinion, i would love this device more if I could read it at night without lights.ProsLibrary with thousands of books, magazine that comes free, built-in free wireless data network, plus Wi-Fi connectivity (no PC needed); separate capacitive color touch-screen pad for navigation, and a virtual keyboard for notes and annotations; 2GB of internal memory (capable of storing 1,500 electronic books) as well as a microSD expansion slot for additional memory; font style and size are adjustable; displays image files and plays MP3 music files; compatible with Windows and Mac machines; battery is removable and user-replaceable; allows free browsing of full-text books while within Barnes & Noble stores; you can lend certain e-books for up to 14 days free of charge; EPUB format compatibility lets you read free Google Books and loaner e-books from your local library; page turn speeds are faster with firmware upgrade.The bad: No protective carrying case included; color LCD ( for color nook)  has an impact on battery life; for black & white battery is really good,in-store reading and loaning capabilities come with notable limits and caveats; no support for Word or text files; no ability to download books when outside the U.S., even when on Wi-Fi.Does it beat Kindle?According to design my answer is no.  The third-generation Amazon Kindle is lighter, thinner, and simply feels a little better to hold in your hand. It also offers double the battery life, more internal memory (4GB versus 2GB). But the new upgrades has given some new features to nook that are not available in kindle. Nook should definitely remain under consideration when you're shopping for e-ink e-book readers. The decision may come down to a personal preference, such as how you feel about the color navigation screen versus the hard keyboard found on the Kindle.If my review did not answer any questions, leave a comment below and I will try my best to answer your question.",4.0,Worthy wifi e-reader for everday reader.,1293321600,"12 26, 2010",Electronics,1.0

They could lose the unit etc. I loaded my credit card information to test the unit. After deciding to return the unit I talked to customer service about deleting my account information.

First there was the innovative kindle, which revolutionized the industry and created a new medium and format for ebooks then came the residual affects of copycat devices like the Nook.  The Nook is being pushed aside and underestimated.  I discovered that the nook was easier to upload and download material onto but it was not as accessible as far as distribution and popularity of ebooks, it lags behind the kindle in popularity because it seems like an imitator.  Some time has to go by since the kindle came out then Nook should make some huge improvements, this is a way that it could overtake the kindle because Barnes & Noble has brick and mortar stores to sell their Nooks and books in which is where most people would come across reading devices.

While there were things about the Kindle I really liked (better screen contrast, and many other features that other reviewers on the Kindle site had written), the one thing that made me choose the Nook was the ability to borrow and read ebooks from my local library. Haven't been back to the library since!Now here comes the Nook Simple Touch (Nook ST) ereader. It is just now starting to show up in B&N; stores (not on Amazon yet). I was lucky enough to find a store near me that had one that was not spoken for yet. I bought it yesterday and have been busy trying it out. It has the same e-ink Pearl screen as the Kindle, so the screen contrast is no longer an issue. And wow, has the user interface improved over the original Nook! (which I thought was clunky) The entire e-ink Pearl screen has full touchscreen capability. On both the Kindle and the original Nook, I felt myself wanting to touch the screen to select a book to read, instead of using the buttons (on the Kindle) or the LCD touchscreen (on the original Nook) to highlight and select the desired ebook. On the Nook ST, the Library screen shows icons for all the ebooks loaded in the device (both library and purchased). Touch the icon, and the ebook opens. Turning the page? Touch the screen on the right side of the page (to go forward) or the left side (to go back). Or swipe your finger across the screen as in flipping a physical book page. Or use the buttons built into the frame. Want to page quickly through a book? Hold down the page turning button. Need a word definition? Touch and hold on the word and a dictionary pops up. The user interface resembles that of an iPhone or iPad, with the icons, virtual keyboard and the physical home button. It even has the ""slide to unlock"" feature like the iPhone.  The touchscreen on the Nook ST is infrared (it senses the heat of your finger, again like iPhone), so a light touch works just fine.  I found that on the original Nook, sometimes it would take multiple touches on the LCD screen for the device to recognize a command.I returned the original Nook since the Nook ST is so much better. Note that the Nook ST doesn't have 3G connectivity, a web browser, or an MP3 player. If you want all that, buy the original Nook. If you don't require all of these features and would like a basic e-reader with an intuitive touch screen interface, then take a look at the Nook ST.The Nook ST is just beginning to become available (only at B&N; right now), but I suspect that Amazon and other high quality retailers will be selling it very soon.Here's another plus for the Nook (whether it is the original one or the ST).  The Kindle has a proprietary ebook format that limits your options in purchasing and reading ebooks.  Nook uses Adobe EPUB, which is an open format and there are multiple online sites that offer books in this format (including most public libraries).",3.0,"This Nook is Good, but the new Nook Simple Touch is WAY Better",1307232000,"06 5, 2011",Electronics,0.0

I would constantly diss the e-readers claiming that books were soooo much better. Then I ordered a book series from Amazon and the books/print was so tiny that I could barely read them without straining my eyes and driving myself crazy. My mom (&lt;3!!) gave me my brothers old nook since he had a new nook color so I could download and read the series on this. It wasn't cheap to download the books, but compared to reading the free versions a friend had sent me (which were horrible because the text was all messed up...typos galore) but the option to make the text larger or smaller and the clarity of the screen made the 8+ dollars per book soooo worth the price.The battery on this lasts so long it's insane. I would read daily maybe 5 hours per day over the summer (hey, I had to finish the series before school resumed!) and I only had to charge it once a week tops, even then the battery wasn't drained I just didn't want to give it a chance to run out. I am so in love with my nook now it's insane. I can download almost any book I could possibly need and carry it around in this tiny little, lightweight nook.Another big plus....MY BOOKMARKS DON'T FALL OUT OF THE NOOK!! Nothing is more frustrating than losing your place and going bananas trying to find it without revealing something you haven't read yet.Also, when it comes to textbooks this is a lifesaver!! My back loves the nook. I cannot recommend the nook (or any e-reader in general) enough. You can still buy physical books (I do and will never stop because I absolutely love them) but for an avid reader the nook is such a great addition to your life.Even though my first nook was free (making it that much sweeter), I would gladly lay down $100+ for a replacement if anything happened to mine or for a newer model, not the color though, that's more like a tablet PC than an e-reader.",5.0,From hater to smitten with this amazing little device...,1317513600,"10 2, 2011",Electronics,1.0

It  offers greater compatibility with different ebook formats than the Kindle (particularly the EPUB format), has access to special offers when you're inside a Barnes and Noble store, and permits you to lend books to other Nook users. There's also a little color LCD touch screen at the bottom for accessing menu options.Personally, I haven't taken advantage of most of the Nook's features yet, but I do like what I see so far. The touchscreen adds a great deal of versatility to the device and I'd say it's easier to access menu options this way than with just one e-ink screen and some buttons. I also appreciate the ability to upgrade the memory with a microSD card, but I would have preferred to do so without opening the device. Also, if you have a problem with the Nook, you shouldn't have a problem getting a replacement. I, er, damaged my first Nook through, shall we say, ""user error,"" but B&N; staff was happy to provide a new one for me.It's not quite perfect, though. It's kind of heavy, for one thing. The touchscreen is a bit slow to respond and can significantly drain the battery, for another. And, some of the Nook's buttons seem to be a little too stiff. I prefer soft, clicky buttons, you know? Maybe in its next iteration the Nook will have proper buttons instead of this ""bendy plastic"" business.Anyway, which e-reader you get largely boils down to your personal preferences, and which retailer's online library you'd rather have access to. For my part, I think the Nook satisfies all of my needs just fine. Be careful where you buy it from, though. $180, which is the price it's selling for on Amazon right now, is way too much when you can just walk into a brick and mortar store and get it for thirty bucks less.",5.0,An excellent e-reader,1295481600,"01 20, 2011",Electronics,1.0

I had a tough time deciding between the nook and the Kindle.  I've seen the Kindle, and there isn't much difference.  The Kindle is thinner, but the nook is by no means bulky.  The screens look identical to me and seem clearer than actual paper.  The touch screen on the nook will use up the battery quickly if you use it too much.  There are two main reasons that I chose the nook.  First, because I can replace the battery myself.  The Kindle works like an iPod, where you have to send it back to Amazon to have the battery replaced.  This was a big selling point for me.  While I understand that I would still own all of the books that I purchased, I'd still rather be able to replace this myself if necessary.  My second reason is that the nook supports more types of files, including files from public libraries.  The Kindle seems to really be geared towards Amazon purchased books.  I'm sure that as competition grows, Amazon will probably make the Kindle more compatible with other formats, but I chose the e-reader that seemed to me to have more options.  There is honestly not much difference between these two e-readers.  Both are excellent and most people would be happy with either.",5.0,I love my nook!,1302825600,"04 15, 2011",Electronics,1.0

At the current price, I think it's a good deal but I'm not sure it would be my choice if I could roll back time.  I originally purchased this because I wanted to rent ebooks from the Library and that wasn't an option with the Kindle.  Now, they come for the Kindle as well as in epub and pdf formats.  You can basically use any ereader to rent these now.I read all these reviews saying that the black and white was like paper, easiest to read.  It's not anything like a paper book, it's far less ""bright"" when it comes to reading.  Don't get me wrong, I love ebooks.  I haven't read a paper book in a year.  It is just that even in regular light it is not as easy to see for me.  You absolutely can read it without a light during the day, but it is not nearly as crisp or easy as it would be with a paper book.  I have a clip on light, and with that it's perfect at night.  I'm able to read in bed and not disturb my husband, if one wants a black and white reader as close to paper as you can get--I'm just not sure this is what one would expect.This reader has a browser which you can use to get on the internet.  It was handy when we were in a hotel with wifi and I didn't bring the laptop and I needed to know when a business opened.  It's certainly not easy to surf, this would not be my choice to use unless in a pinch.The battery does not last as long as I expected.  I get maybe a week and a half out of it, if I turn it completely off when not using it--and if I have it on airplane mode (not wifi enabled).  I do read at least a few hours a day.  The time is much shorter if I let it just hibernate.I am not sure if the text size options are specific to the device or the book.  It appears to me it is the device that offers limited options, though it varies based on the originating text of the book. The text size on extra large--the largest option-- is often (it varies by book) small enough that it would equal that of a normal book.  My vision is pretty good and occasionally I'm annoyed by how small extra large is.  In some books medium is the same as extra large in others.  I do think that for anyone with vision challenges, limited text size might be an issue.Obtaining books is easy to do through Barnes and Noble.  You need to go online on a computer and provide a credit card.  You can then order them on the computer, or through your device.  I generally use the computer, but if you know what you want--ordering directly from the Nook is quick and easy.  Transferring library rentals is also as easy as drag and drop, using Adobe Digital Solutions (free app, the library should have a link to download it).All in all, it's a good ereader.  I've never had any mechanical issues with it.  It is sturdy and reliable.",4.0,Not Sure I'd Do It Over Again,1322265600,"11 26, 2011",Electronics,1.0

His books are about the 4th grade reading level, from 4.0 to 4.4. She was only reading mid third grade until reading on the Nook. She would beg to read on my Nook. I got her her own and she is on her 4th Rick Riordan book.

The nook is heavy, poorly balanced, offers only a small edge for holding and thus cramps the fingers.  It is nothing like reading a book.

If you think you will get your books cheaper - forget it.  I wanted to order a current book and found the nook was only $3 cheaper.  Only the classics are at low prices.

{'$oid': '5a13242d741a2384e88f4367'},AJQRYTPV3JK3C,1400532620,Dan O.,"[2, 7]","I bought a nook about 8 months ago. I wanted to consider a Kindle but they were not available locally so I was very hesitant to buy one sight-unseen.BN had just released their wifi-only version for $149 which was very reasonable. I bought one from BN with moderate research and minimal hands-on. I have regretted it ever since.Today I said goodbye to my nook library and bought a kindle3. I can't comment on it very much except it is light-years faster than the nook and the interface actually works. I have about 90 books in my nook library, most of which I paid for so I'm a little frustrated.Things that are good about the nook:1. It looks much better than a kindle. While it sits there unused on my nightstand.2. ePub support. I live in Alaska which means it will be another 5 years before our libraries start loaning books via epub so it's not a big deal for me.3. Free Fridays. Every Friday nook owners can download a BN-selected book for free. Most are crappy fantasy/romance books but I have discovered several very good authors that I wouldn't have otherwise.Things that are bad about the nook:1. Awful, awful, awful touch input. I cringe thinking about using my nook with the unwieldy touchscreen. The screen itself is slow to respond, it sometimes registers additional clicks but mostly just ignores them while giving you visual feedback so you wait 5-10 seconds for it to actually do nothing.The touchscreen display is very jerky and difficult to navigate. You navigate the menus by scrolling through them on the touchpad. It will randomly jump to the top or the bottom. It will randomly ignore a touch (there is visual feedback, so it's not a mis-touch). It will randomly click twice on the succeeding menus.Trying to type on the keyboard or use it to look up a word (you need to use arrow keys on the touchpad to scroll a sluggish cursor around the page to pick one) is a test in patience I no longer have patience for. The keys provide visual feedback when pressed. This suggests you can type away merrily until you look at the text field to see only 2 or 3 characters were actually used. You have to type very sloooow and deliberate for the gnomes inside to catch up with you.The touchscreen is the main reason I ditched the nook. It is horribly implemented and makes the entire device borderline unusable.2. Browser. The BN rep sure talked that up. After spending 15 minutes trying to use the browser to register a BN account so I could actually read books I gave up and used my laptop. The browser takes about 30 seconds on average to display a page. It doesn't matter if it's a real page, the mobile version of Facebook or just google search. It will also randomly crash every minute or two. And by crash I mean you will suddenly be returned to the home screen for no apparent reason.Do not buy the nook if you even think you might want to try using it as a browser to check your email while you're sitting in bed reading a book.3. Battery life sucks. Sorry, but it does. I like to read a lot and having to charge it every couple days makes me upset they claim a 14-day battery life on it. I think it gets about 14 hours per charge (minus the 10% when it automatically goes to sleep). There is a persistent charging bug with the nook, or at least with mine; If you have wifi enabled but the device is sleeping (as in just normally leaving wifi on) when you plug it in to charge, the wifi will activate internally as it (I assume) checks with BN for book updates. This stops the charging and it will not resume unless you turn off the wifi and unplug and replug the charging cable.This is very frustrating as you plug the device in and forget to turn off the wifi. The next morning you grab it only to see the cute ""Your battery is too low to operate"" message.4. It weighs about 20% more than the kindle and is noticeably thicker. Not a big deal, but if you're in bed reading with one hand it weighs about as much as a heavier hardcover which means you're switching hands every so often. Heavier does not always mean better.5. Page turns. When I first got the nook it took between 3-5 seconds to turn a page. I would actually press the page turn button when I got to the last paragraph and could finish it before the page turned. A software update has vastly improved the page turn speed (about .5 seconds now) but only when turning the actual book pages. Library pages, shopping and browsing shelves still take 3+ seconds. I have tried a factory reset twice and either my device is defective (BN support did not think so) or it still sucks. This also strongly influences the cursor movement speed when trying to select a word and the speed at which you can enter text.6. Screen readability is acceptable. It looks like the page was printed on a crappy inkjet printer, with pixilation apparent. The kindle is more crisp and darker.7. The included Merrium Webster dictionary is broken. A large number of entries simply do not work. If you search for one of the effected entries the nook performs a search before inexplicably returning you to the book page. I do not remember which letter(s) are affected but it does not appear to be priority for BN to fix.8. Shelves. Shelves are BN's answer to everyone complaining how difficult it is to find books in the library. You can create a custom named shelf and place books on it. It is very clunky and sluggish and expect to spend 30 seconds trying to find your new book and another 15 trying to put it on a shelf. Sometimes it just won't let you put a book on a shelf and you have to restart the nook. This adds another 2 hours because you will be so frustrated by this point you will put the nook down start punching holes in the wall.9. Sometimes books fail to open. This means you have to go back to your library and open the book again. I have no idea why it happens but it happens frequently enough to mention. Once you get a book open and keep reading that book until you're finished it works well enough. But the menus, navigation and overall usefulness is virtually nonexistent.10. It's built on an android platform, which means it's buggy and randomly crashes or stops working. A restart usually solves this, but I keep shouting ""WHY, WHY, WHY"" every time I have to. Although I haven't had to restart it since I got the kindle. This may or may not be a result of not using it any more.Closing thoughts: I would encourage you very strongly to use one before buying it and investing in an e-library only to find yourself in the same situation I found myself. If you really have your heart set on it, buy from a local BN and try it out for a couple weeks so you can return it. I waited for the nook software update that was supposed to fix all these problems. After that seemingly only addressed the page turn speed I was outside of the return period and stuck with this nice-looking nightstand decorum.",1.0,"Save your money, or 10 reasons the nook is awful",1305417600,"05 15, 2011",Electronics,0.0

I was an English major in college and I read tons of books so for a long time I went back and forth between the kindle and the nook. I love amazon, but the nook appealed to me more. I finally bought the nook just after I graduated because I had some leftover graduation money and I am so glad I did. The only thing I might have done differently would be to have paid the extra fifty dollars for the free 3g. I don't really use the web browser, but it would be nice to have since I don't get web on my phone. Anyway, the browser is actually not that bad, if you view a regular web page you have to pan side to side to see the whole thing, so for emails I just use the mobile version of yahoo and gmail since I just have to scroll up and down. The browser works well for basics, like email, checking movie times, and a quick wikipedia search.The nook really isn't any heavier than most books (except maybe mass market paperbacks) and I find it to be very comfortable to hold (though usually I prefer holding it with a cover on so it's more like a book). I love the way the books can be organized in different categories. Usually I just organize them by date last opened though since I read more than one book at a time and can therefore have all the books I'm reading at the top of the list. I also love the touch screen it's not perfect (iPod touch and iPhone touch screens are much better), but I don't mind. The games that are included are absolutely perfect for me too. I love chess and sudoku and hopefully they'll add more in the future to be downloaded, but I'm happy with just those two. The screens contrast is great and while the new Kindle says it has better contrast, I honestly don't think I'd need it to be better. I can read perfectly fine and pictures look great on the screen. Another thing that I love about the nook is that you can personalize the screensaver and background (I know that's not really important, but I like having my favorite pics on my nook).Anyway, I'm really happy with the nook and I think it was well worth the money. An ereader will never take the place of actual books for me, I still buy both. I usually read free classics and pay for the books that I know I won't really ever want to read again (like the paperbacks I used to buy from target or walmart). Other books that I know I will want to keep to reread, I buy the physical copy. I love the price of ebooks too. Usually they are either equal to or less than the cost of regular books and you can sometimes find them for super cheap! I've never tried the kindle, but honestly I'd say they're probably fairly equal when it comes down to it (I mean really reading a book on a screen doesn't vary that much).

I've also spent dozens of hours on the telephone with Nook support and other activities related to keeping it running.  I'm an experienced software designed/programmer, engineer, etc. and I can assure you that compared to a paper book, this is a seriously flawed concept.  If you insist on buying an eBook reader, make sure you allocate plenty of time that you could have better spent on reading a real book to spend on arguing on the telephone with foreign call center reps.  B&N;'s concept of customer support is severely lacking and they appear to have little knowledge when it comes to supporting electronic gear.On top of those problems, consider the very concept of the electronic book.  While you will pay close to the same price you'd pay for a real book on sale, you won't own the book - you'll have a license to use it.  When you're finished with the book, maybe you'd like to be able to loan it to a relative or friend, but you can only do that if they have a Nook and you can loan it for two weeks only.  I suppose when the two weeks is up, the borrower sees the book disappear, finished or not.And then there's the odd problem of your Nook for some reason being tied closely to the email address you had on file with B&N; when you registered your Nook.  I recently had to change my email address and updated my B&N; account with the new address and new B&N; password.  After that, I could no longer download books, and was unable to unregister and register my Nook (that was supposed to fix the problem, according to the support center).  If you happen to get yourself into that dilemma, be ready for a long drawn-out session on the telephone.  The problem was that B&N; neglected to spell this situation out on their website when I changed my email address.So, if you're into ""going green"", driving a hybrid car (and thinking it's going to save you money in the long run), then the Nook may be for you.  If all you want to do is read, forget the Nook and go to the local library or bookstore and spend your time reading.  Give the price of the Nook to a local charity.

I found the reading experience much less pleasurable than a paper book.  The screen contrast is too low to read in low-light situations, the page turning mechanism is clunky, the page has an annoying way of flashing at every page turn, and the tactile experience is just not satisfying.The deciding factor, however, was the problem I had with connectivity.  The nook would not connect to wireless hotspots in several of my favorite coffee shops, and I found it impossible to transfer ebooks from my iBook.  I spoke with the experts at Barnes & Noble, who told me that the nook works better with some hotspots than others, and that yes, there can be compatibility problems with Macs.  In the end, I was reduced to using the nook to buy ebooks at my local Barnes & Noble store, where I discovered that seemingly all of the million-plus free books are OCR translations that have not been proofed.  They were so full of typos that they were virtually unreadable.In the end, I decided that the nook is really not market-ready.

I even went to the store and tested the nook, played with it. I went to other stores that had other e readers and looked at them as well. Then one of my coworkers showed me her Kindle and I was able to play with it and look at it.Then the i pad came out, So I went to the store and looked at the i pad and played with it as well. I have read review after review and watched you-tube...Well The holidays came and my husband bought me the Nook!!! I was so excited! I wanted the Nook as soon as I saw it, but took my time and compared it to other e readers.. I knew right from the start which e reader I wanted after being in discussion with others about e readers and after looking and playing with a few of them.Right out of the box the Nook, made me happy and gave me confirmation of my long desire to own the Nook. My husband knew that I wanted it, but I waited trying to justify why I needed an e reader and to see if anyone of them would go beyond my expectations. The Nook did exactly that! For me the Nook was worth the money and time it took to decide on which one to purchase... Here is why I love the Nook, I can lend books to other, I can download from my library which is so awesome! I can surf the net for FREE!!!!!! no monthly fees like the i pad, It fits in my computer bag, purse, which makes it so easy to take with me, It has my favorite games, Chess and Sukodu! It was easy for me to download a ebook that I already have, but have been unable to read due to me not wanting to tote my lap top around, the book loaded right from my lap top to the Nook in no time... The amount of free books that are available to the Nook, and the daily free treats from Barnes And Nobles! Which will more than pay for the Nook over time. Being able to call Barnes and Nobles and talk to a live person over the phone and being able to walk in the store and get face to face customer service.I also like the fact that when you are in the store you can read ebooks for free for an hour and download more free ebooks! For me It was the right choice for our family, as when we go to Barnes and Nobles with our children we can stay longer now that we have the nook and can receive free treats and more free ebooks! It pays for itself... These are some of the reason why I love my nook and I am excited that I received the Nook for a gift! I can not say enough about the Nook, I don't have to be tied to one book store like Itunes, Ibook, are the Kindle store... I don't like limits and the Nook allows me to be free to choose where to get my books from...Now with that said, When I visited my local Barnes and Nobles and received a free smoothie, It was so stress free and everyone was so nice.. I could not believe it!I have also downloaded music that I can listen to and have my ear plugs for that, I have also downloaded several books which was so easy to download that I was shocked! I like getting my monies worth, and not having to pay extra monthly fees.Now with that said, I hope that when you do your research you will consider the Nook, I am surprised that there are not more reviews than the current number of reviews. Well back to my Nook, as I can not put it down!What a great gift, and a great buy!!!**************Update****************5/30/2011The Nook is still awesome... Since I have owned the Nook for a while now, I came back to offer an update..As far as downloading books, I downloaded books the other day and before I could blink they were on my Nook!I am still happy with my Nook and love my Nook! I have recommended the Nook to friends and family who have also made purchases and are happy with the Nook as well.The performance of my Nook is awesome, and I have had great experiences with my Nook since the day I was surprised with the Nook as a gift! Best gift anyone can give! The joy of reading!I take my Nook with me every where! My children are still in love with my Nook and love to play the games on my Nook or read a book. My husband even likes for the children to read books on the Nook. The Nook has brought so much fun and the joy of reading to our family!You can also go to Barnes and Nobles and take classes to learn more about your Nook as there is so much to learn and so much that the Nook has to offer. Check in your area to see what times your local Barnes and Nobles offers classes.I also like the Nook because the Nook continues to educate you on a daily basis with the daily blog of what took place on the days of the week, for example if you turn on your Nook right now and go to the daily, it will inform you what took place on this date. Which to me is a neat feature as you get to learn something new about something you may have  not known.As far as the touch screen part of the Nook, we love it! It does not distract us but adds to the beauty of the Nook in our opinion. It is easy for my family to use.********2012 Update*****Well it is 4/24/2012 and I still love my Nook and my Nook still works great! I just wanted to give another update for individuals looking for a e reader.As of this date, our children are now asking as they did before can they have my Nook. And for now they can use my Nook, but I still love Nook and I am not ready to give my Nook up. One day we will purchase Nooks for the whole family.As far as use, I was out in the sun and reading with no problem. So many e reads and tablets are currently on the market. This nook still works for me and still performs and amazes me. There is still so much to learn with the Nook I currently own. If you are looking for a great affordable e reader. Don't over look Nook.  Good luck with your decision.Hopefully this update will help you in your decision. We would by one hundred more and pass them out as gifts and charity, just so people can get to read and find joy in reading!

Slow and unpredictable response to commands; essentially useless.

Boycotting Amazon so purchased Nook. Took it out of box. A little heavier than expected. Didn't get a chance to handle one at the store (B&N;). Viewing screen is smaller than a paperback book, so not sure why my wife wanted it anyway.I created an account on B&N; but failed to add credit card info because it wasn't required. Tried to register. It seemed stuck on 'Registering Nook, should only take a few moments"" screen. It never gave any indication as to why it wouldn't finish registering. So, wife read instructions and noted that a Credit Card must be added to account. Did so and it registered relatively quickly.Purchased a cover for it the next day (relatively expensive).Wife finally picked a book. I went to B&N; website, purchased the Nook version online. Waited the promised 60 seconds and it wasn't on the Nook. Went to the website and it said it 'Hasn't been delivered yet'. What??? (My credit card was charged within a millisecond but the book wasn't delivered? After 2 hour wait, finally called their tech support. Foreign gentleman told me to wait until the morning and check again (although he did say ""I don't want to set an expectation of delivery time"" [I don't think he was supposed to say that out loud]). So, I purchase an ebook and it still takes 14 hours to deliver????? Certainly DID NOT meet my expectation. I thought I could be on a beach, purchase the book and it be on my Nook before the Margarita arrived. That is what they lead you to believe.Anyways, woke up in the morning and turned it on. Book was finally there.So, so far, doesn't meet my expectations. Not sure if Kindle would do any better, but as stated, wasn't buying an Amazon product.UPDATE: Jan 4. Well, I was wrong. When I said book was there, I guess it was in a 'list' on my nook. Apparently you still have to 'download' it. So, I hit the 'download' button. All I'm getting is ""Download Queued: Will Complete Shortly"". That's been on there for an hour. I'm waiting for tech support. I am seriously considering taking it back tomorrow. I will, of course, forfeit the $30+ I spent for a cover at best buy, but at this point that is the lesser of two evils. BN website actually says ""Download wirelessly in seconds!""UPDATE2: Jan 10. Before I returned my Nook to BN, I decided to try to download the book at work. The Nook connected to our wireless and downloaded pretty quickly. So... it appears that even though the Nook shows fully connected to my home wireless, with great reception, there is still a problem there. I'm not sure why the Nook doesn't at least tell me that there is a problem though. (it's not my internet connect, on night in question tested download speeds on wirelessly connected laptop and got outstanding results). Anyways, didn't return Nook and will bump up rating to 3 stars. Still don't care much for it telling me wireless is fine (but it isn't) and don't care for BN website.

Before I purchased it, I spent weeks researching the differences between the Barnes and Noble Nook and the Kindle and other ereaders. I chose the Nook because I can read .epub format books on it; something you cannot do on the Kindle. The Kindle only supports .pdf files and ebooks in the proprietary Amazon.com format. That severely limits the number and type of ebooks you can read.With the Nook, I have borrowed free ebooks from my local library and within minutes downloaded them to my computer and then transferred them to my Nook. AWESOME! In addition, unlike the Kindle, I can read free ebooks available from Google.The only thing I don't like about the Nook and the Kindle is that neither one of them has a back-lit screen so, at night or in the dark, you have to have alternative ample light. So I either turn on a lamp or use the small, clip-on light I bought at the local RiteAid for about $10. It works just fine.So far, I have had no problems navigating my ebooks; everything works smoothly and the pages turn quickly. I'm enjoying the convenience of being able to travel with 30 books and audio-books at a time. I also have some music loaded on my Nook so I can listed to it while I read.

I have only left my bedroom with it one time. Shortly after returning from my friends home with the nook, I noticed a tiny crack in the upper corner of the touchscreen. Now I have to press the buttons really hard, in order for them to work. I deal with this, because once I have the book downloaded I don't really need the buttons so much. Yesterday while reading in bed as I usually do. I noticed a sudden appearance of a crack where the page turning arrow is. These two cracks have made this product seem cheap and flimsy to me. I love the e-reader idea, but I'm almost scared to even touch it at this point. It's way too fragile. I've never dropped or mishandled it, so there is really no reason for it to be so damaged.

He couldn't to get it to work properly after he bought a book online.  He made numerous trips to a Barnes and Noble retail store where no one helped.  Finally, after going back yet again to see the Nook ""expert"" they made some software upgrades and it sort of worked.  He was so dissatisfied that he was ready to throw it out.  So I said I would take it.  I then had a similar experience--trips back to B&N;, nice staff who tried to help but couldn't and a dysfunctional product. At my last visit, I was told that if they were really going to help me I needed to bring it in WITH my computer. I use a desktop for my downloaded books.I still have the receipt, but they won't let me return it because the various efforts we made to get it working took so long.  They say that the device isn't defective--it just doesn't really work.  It works much better in the store than at home.  I think they have a much faster wireless connection in the store, which explains why it seemed to work there, but it doesn't work with my desktop or our laptops via WiFi. Not only is it hard to download books, when I do download older books they are usually unreadable because of problems in rendering the .pdfs on the screen.I wasted another day trying to get library books to work--setting up accounts and files, tinkering with the settings etc.I finally gave up and got a Kindle DX. I downloaded and read an 18th-century text from Google Books within minutes of charging the Kindle. It is perfectly readable including the diagrams and plates.What I thought was a nice gift turned into a major headache for my husband and then for me. B&N; weren't honest with me about what it could do. Then they wouldn't let us return it.

It works, but with the slow refresh rate of the e-ink screen and the small size of the color LCD, it's more of a novelty than something you would use as a primary internet device.  Unfortunately, the browser doesn't support downloading, so you can't go the Project Gutenberg website and download a book directly from the site to the Nook.

However I soon discovered that not all books are available on the Kindle and 99.9% of the books I couldn't get on my Kindle are on Nook.  After much research I soon learned that if you want good ebook reader you buy either a Kindle or a Nook.  So I asked Santa for it.I will not tell you I like the Nook better than my Kindle or my Kindle better than my Nook.  Both have excellent features that make them both excellent ereaders.Here's a few on the Nook:  1- It keeps the book title, time, and battery charge visible while reading.  2-It starts up just a bit faster than the Kindle.  3-You can use your own photos for the screen saver and wallpaper.  4-it recognizes the table of contents in PDF books.  5-it reads EPUB file types (meaning you can buy books from Borders.com too and read them)As for the Kindle here are a few features I love about it:  1-I like the real keyboard as the buttons are much easier to push than on screen.  2-It reads PDFS much better than the Nook, more so when you have the PDF converted.  3-the page turns are a bit faster.  4-I prefer the black housing to white.  5-the reading page/screen has no glare at all (the Nook's little color panel on the bottom is very reflective) and it seems the print is a little darker.Both the Nook and Kindle are very easy to purchase and load books on.  I think the thing I was most disappointed in with the Nook are the covers.  They are not enough covers that actually close, like the Kindle and when sticking this reader into your purse or bag, you don't want the cover to open and scratch the screen/reading surface.If you are looking for a great ereader, you cannot go wrong with this Nook or the Kindle latest generation, in my book they are both on the top shelf.  Now if we could just get one that is a smashed together version of both their great features into one unit.Update:  After using both my Nook and Kindle for a while now I've decided I do like the Kindle much better than the Nook.  The page turning buttons on the Kindle are very very light touch, the reading screen does have darker print, and the collections feature is top notch.  Now my Nook, the buttons take some pushing to turn the pages, the reading screen is lighter, and the shelves option is ok.  What I don't care for in the shelves feature is I can't colapse the shelves to just show the shelves and then open them when I want to search in them.  I also don't care for the B&N; Library being seperate from My Documents.  On the Kindle these are all included together and you can sort them out using collections.  With the Nook you must use the naviation screen to switch between them.  I've also had some trouble with the navigation screen on the bottom.  I don't have large fingers and don't wear long fingernails so moving around on the screen should be easy.  However, when I'm tryting to scroll or select something on the touch screen I just can't seem to get what I want.  But when I don't mean to move on the touch screen but accidently touch it, I trigger a menu move.  It's still a very good reader, but when comparing options and usability, I'd choose the Kindle any day over the Nook.  I'll purchase most of my books on the Kindle and what isn't Kindlized will go on the Nook.",5.0,Excellent reader,1293321600,"12 26, 2010",Electronics,1.0

We spent plenty of time researching and reviewing other e-readers and decided this was our reader of choice - I'm truly happy about the decision.  It was user friendly right out of the box, simple to connect wirelessly and quick to charge.  There are so many options for loading books on the Nook and one of the selling features for me was that I can take it to any Barnes and Noble store for free in-store downloads and reads.  I even love the fact that I'm able to download (check out) digital books from our local library online - what a bonus!  I have NOT experienced any trouble with battery longevity or overall durability.  I take my Nook everywhere and just toss it in my purse, complete with Nook cover of course.  I take it to school (while waiting for the kids!), doctor's appointments and even to church (gotta look up those Bible verses!).  My NIV Bible is loaded on the Nook which is wonderful - although it is a bit difficult to navigate through the books/verses in a pinch.  So I'd have to say I like my faithful, printed Bible for quick reference, highlighting and notetaking.  But, all other reading is done on my Nook.  The screen is clear and crisp, bookmarks are easy to use, books and documents are easy to navigate - and many times I'm fighting for control of my Nook with my son (9) who always wants to read it!  The only complaint is that the internet connection is a bit slow at times, but who really cares?  I've got my laptop to do all that.  And any questions I've had on the Nook - I just take it to the store for quick, reliable and friendly service.Use Nook as your e-reader ... less paper / more knowledge!""Reading is to the mind what exercise is to the body."" - Joseph Addison",5.0,Reading = A+ / Reading a NOOK = A++!!!,1288137600,"10 27, 2010",Electronics,1.0

I'd been excited to an e-reader, and when I was asked what I wanted for the holidays, my immediate response was a Kindle. I hadn't done any research, knew nothing about it other than it was the only e-reader I had heard of due to commercials, conversations, etc.When I received my Kindle, I immediately fell in love. I purchased several books using an Amazon Gift Card and carried it everywhere I went. It was the perfect size, the screen was clear and crisp, and it took seconds to set up. I had heard that my local library had a lending library of eBooks, and day after receiving my Kindle I raced over there to renew my library card. That was where my love affair with my Kindle began to fray.After getting my first book via email, I set about working to get it on my Kindle. Needless to say, this led to hours of frustration. I scoured the internet looking for a way to make it work, to get this ePub book to read on my Kindle. After an exhaustive search, I determined that without breaking dozens of international copyright laws are instantly learning how to hack or re-write script. I learned how proprietary the device truly was. In fact, if I wanted to read anything, I would have to purchase it from the Kindle store on Amazon.com.  It was with a heavy heart that I deleted all my purchases from my Kindle, packaged it back up, and sent it back to Amazon. To their credit, Amazon's customer service made the return process extremely easy. Within days I had my complete refund, including for the books I had purchased.Enter the nook. During my research, I had learned that the nook had the capability to do all the things the Kindle had lacked. It was specifically listed on my library's site as a capable e-reader, and allowed me the flexibility of purchasing from other sites, lending books to friends, or previewing books in store. I found a seller on Amazon who was offering the nook for its expected price of $149, not the ridiculous mark-up some of the vendors on this site are asking (in some cases $180???).the seller shipped the device quickly, and it arrived in the prompt fashion we have come to expect of Amazon purchases.I am very, very happy with my choice. While the nook is slightly larger, and perhaps a bit heavier, it performs like a champ. The e-ink screen has the same clarity and crispness of the Kindle, and the page turning feels sharp and quick, no different than flicking a page in its ink and paper counterparts. Setup was quick and easy,  I was able to connect to my WEP-encrypted Wireless network within seconds. I already had a B&N; account, so registration was a breeze, and my first book purchase was quick and easy as well. You have the option of purchasing from the site on your PC or perusing the store right on your nook, and the books arrive within seconds. The reading experience is fantastic, my love of reading ha been renewed after years of growing stale while reading and re-reading the covers on my bookshelves at home. I recommend a cover, of which Barnes and Noble offers a myriad of choices for both practicality and style.The only cons towards the nook that I have discovered thus far:1) The touchscreen, unlike the e-ink screen, has a glossy finish. It took a little getting used to the first time I read my nook. There can be a slight glare, and I recommend setting the touchscreen time out to 10 seconds. After just a few hours of reading, however, I forgot it was even there. I use a book light at night, and all it took was setting up the light so that it didn't reflect off the touch screen.2) The touchscreen is also not what we have come to expect with the advent and popularity of devices like the iPhone and Android. It can be slower than we are used to, but if you got this device primarily for reading as I did, this will be a minor annoyance.And thats really the only downsides I have been able to find thus far. Its also exciting having a brick and mortar storefront to visit with my nook. My first visit to the store with it, I was able to get a free smoothie from the cafe using a coupon from the screen. In fact there are several offers from the store page, including discounts and other offers. Add to this you can read for free in the store, and it just makes for a great experience all around. I stepped into the store, turned on my Nook, and it instantly welcomed me into the store, connecting instantly to their local network and filling me in on current offers.While the Kindle may be the more talked about e-reader, the smart choice is the nook. Until Amazon lifts the proprietary restrictions, the Kindle will always be an extraordinary device with ridiculous limitations on its capabilities. Go with the nook, you'll be happier in the long run.",4.0,The Smartest Choice.,1293321600,"12 26, 2010",Electronics,1.0

I was really hoping to receive a Kindle for my birthday but as it turned out I only had Barnes and Noble giftcards so I opted for Nook instead. After a week of constant use I can give you both my pros and cons.Pros:- Very Easy to use with ease of setup. (right in store)- Books actually look like a printed page with very crisp text- ""More In Store"" feature so you can read a book up to one hour in store.- Bright easy to control touch-screen makes browsing your Nook easy.- Fairly cheap books- User replaceable battery- Many file formats supported- Carry your full library wherever you go.- Books download in around 20 seconds.Cons:- Fairly short battery life for an e-reader ( around 5 days of general use with wifi off all but about 10 minutes,somewhat due to touch screen)- Page turns could be improved (currently around 1.25 seconds)- Light, but not as light as I would have preferred (still fairly easy to hold in one hand, but after a while you have to switch hands)- Very little options to organize books.- Wifi is very hard to access.All in all this is a sleek, stylish, and easy to use book reader. It does not have as much battery life as I would like and the page turns lag a little bit but the good things outweigh these two big cons.

My first attempt at owning a Kindle resulted in two failing devices for which I eventually obtained a refund.My birthday is today; my brother asked me what I wanted two weeks ago and I told him the Kindle. Unfortunately at that precise moment Amazon was right in the middle of rolling out the new Wi-Fi only Kindle and all models were unavailable.  So, I went for the barnes & noble nook Wi-Fi only.Considering my previous experience with the Kindle, I tried not to get too excited. I went on the net to read reviews of the nook and was fearful. I read that it was buggy, that it lagged when you changed pages, that the touch interface was not all that responsive.All of this was wrong; the page turns are quick and do not interrupt the flow of reading.  The touch interface is very nice and I like seeing my book covers in color. When you choose the Cover Flow, your books slide by with the touch of a finger and you simply tap on the book you want to read at that moment.  This was surprisingly helpful when I went to make purchases on the B&N; Store. I know you don't judge a book by its cover, but how many times has a nice colorful packaging led me to a book I wanted to read, uhm; many times. I was really intrigued with the ""swipe"" page turn that you used the touch screen for, however this did not seem to function correctly on the store model or on my own nook. Strangely, after a period of time, it now works perfectly. A representative told me it simply had to adapt to my touch...I don't know how much I trust that statement, however when she turned a page on the display nook it responded to her very well. (Perhaps it was a learning curve?)Side-loading documents: Wow, if you have any epub or pdf documents all you have to do is side load them and voila.  I do recommend a free program called Calibre, which organizes your books, helps you edit the tags, add a color cover, or convert to epub. Pdf is not very easy to read on the nook, but if you convert to epub it goes smoothly, unless there are alot of photos or images, which lessens the accuracy of the conversion. Calibre has even converted files like, Word-Doc, Html, Palm, etc. Calibre will let you pick and choose books to upload to the nook directly from the program; in other words it 'sees' the nook.Drawbacks to the nook: The battery life, that nifty little color touch screen eats the battery power like mad.  B&N; claim that you get 10 days, cut that in half. I do not know if this is because I use the touch screen to do my page turns or not,(the other option being the side buttons) but I am leaning toward, maybe? LCD screens notoriously use power; but using the page turn function does not require the back-light to be on, so I am not sure how it is eating up the battery so badly. It is honestly not that much of a problem for me. I am around my computer so much that it is unlikely a day will go by without it being attached to the CPU or an outlet next to my bed. I have gone almost four days with not re-charging; and I could see that little power icon decrease at least to slightly more than half in that time.Oh - and that nifty little cover flow on the color screen.  Don't expect it to work for Your Documents.  (There are two libraries, the B&N; purchased books and your side-loaded books or documents.) Also there is no way to sort your documents to your specification so you either sort by author, title, or the date you loaded them, very annoying if you build up a nice library; which is highly likely considering you can add an SD card to your nook and increase memory to 16 maybe 32 gigabytes. Speaking of which with that ability to increase memory, it would have been nice if the MP3 Player interface were a little more sophisticated.  An interesting ability is to play an unabridged audio-book and read the book at the same time. I am not sure who would do that, but then again I understand spoken Spanish more than I am capable of reading it.  This might be useful to me in that area, if I can find the matching audio-book/ Spanish-book. (Nuance in foreign language is often lost in English translation.)Never having owned a functioning 3G eBook-reader, I never really missed it with my home Wi-Fi. I have discovered several places close to where I ""haunt"" which have AT&T; free to my nook. I already have a huge collection of books lined up for me to read... so feeling a ""need"" for the 3G seems unlikely. I have always done this, collected books that line up, ready for me to read. (By the way... the in store B&N; Wi-Fi connection has s*cked at every B&N; store I have been to. Amazingly Border's free Wi-fi worked better, I just couldn't buy through the B&N; store. I had to go to my smart phone, buy the book, and it uploaded.)So how do I feel about my nook; I absolutely love it! To be fair however, had I received a functioning Kindle, I would have felt the same way about it, I am certain. I think the Kindle has deficiencies with the lack of a touch/color interface and the side loading documents ability. However, that screen kills the battery as I stated.  The reason for liking the separate touch interface is that you don't want to touch your e-ink screen; I don't see how Sony's all touch interface e-reader is going to be popular when you are smudging your read screen all the time, though I must admit I would like to try one out.The nook is comfortable in all sorts of positions, laying in bed, on the couch, holding it next to you; even laying it away from you and increasing the font so that you could read without holding it. I highly recommend a reading light, especially if you had grown accustomed to reading LCD screens in the dark (my kindle program on my Android phone.)It is rather frustrating, I would have preferred a Kindle simply because I was impressed with Amazon customer service when my Kindle malfunctioned.I do recommend the nook. It would be nice if they would lessen DRM restrictions so I could buy books from Amazon or any other place for that matter.SincerlyR",5.0,nook wifi is it a worthy e-reader?

{'$oid': '5a13242d741a2384e88f43cc'},A20Y7REXQZ1REW,1400532620,Ryan Kurtz,"[11, 11]","First off, I want to start out by saying that I love my Nook. My friend is an employee of B&N; so he was there to help guide me along in my selection and answer any questions I had. So, yes, I did have a little bias to the product to begin with. However, for what I need, this is perfect in almost every single way. In my review I'll compare the Nook to the Kindle ($139 version) and it's major differences, just so people know what I'm talking about in terms of other products as we go down the list.The Bad (If you want to call it that):1. The Nook is a little heavier than the Kindle. I'm not sure of the exact weight differences, but just by feel alone it is a tad bit heavier. Now, that can be a good or bad thing depending on how you look at it. I for one don't find it to be a deal buster, the weight is not catastrophically heavier and uncomfortable, but it is heavier than the Kindle. I do think, however, that the durability of the Nook is a little better compared to the Kindle. The Nook has built in paddles to turn the pages, while the Kindle has flappy paddles along the side that feel as though they could break if I dropped it on it's side or if I touched it to hard. My suggestion for anyone interested in buying the Nook is to also buy a carrying case for it so it makes it easier to read, almost as if you were reading a real book. The covers at B&N; usually start around $30.2. The Nook does have a touch screen that has a bit of glare to it. Some others have posted their reviews of how they dislike the glare when the touch screen goes dark. For me it is a bit distracting if you find yourself wandering away from the text. However, whenever I read a book I find many distractions around me while I read. It's not a huge deal in anyway and some have posted if you turn it to the right angle you won't see your reflection. Again, not a deal buster in anyway I wouldn't think.3. The start up time is atrocious. I can't defend this one in anyway. Amish people can put up houses in a faster amount of time before the Nook would have a chance to get to your homepage. Ok, so not quite that slow, but you get the idea. I haven't timed it yet but I'm going to take an educated guess that it takes around 1-1/2 minutes to start up. That is something that should have been addressed from B&N; to begin with. Again, I can't defend this one in anyway.Ok, so what you have all been waiting for: The Good1. The extra storage feature is superb. The Nook comes with a built in 2GB storage space. Enough for most people, 2GB will get most every book you want to read in your Nook with no problem. However, if you are a fanatic reader that has Newspapers and Magazines delivered to your Nook everyday or every week, this can begin to take up space if you don't free it up. But don't fret! The Nook comes with an extra storage slot for your SD card that can hold up to whatever the highest SD card space is out there. The great thing about it is, SD cards are a lot cheaper today than you would have found 3 years ago, so adding space is cheap.2. The Nook has a featured called ""LendMe"". This is something that the Kindle does not have and I'm sure for competition sake will have in the future. This a great, great, great feature to the Nook! If you have any friends, family or co-workers that have a Nook and have a book on theirs that you would like to read, you can hook up wireless or through the computer and Lend them a copy of it for up to 14 days. If you're a fast reader then you can knock out a 500-600 page book in easily 14 days.3. Your county library might be on the list of Nook rentals. In the county in which I reside in North Carolina, our county library is fortunate enough to have a system in which I can rent books for 14 days from the library. This also is something the Kindle does not have. Before I go off on how great the feature for renting books is, I should point out that the library is going to have a limited selection of books for you to rent. I'm a big Thomas Sowell reader and he has approximately 30 books out on the market. However, the county library that I rent from has only 1 book from his selection. So do you're research before you buy a book, your county library might have it already. The feature, as I have seen, is relatively easy to use. You do have to hard wire your Nook to your computer after you download some software, but it's really simple and the kind people at your local county library can assist you on how to do this. In fact our county library had everything we needed in terms of software and directions on their website.4. Finally. You can take your Nook to B&N; and read any book for up to an hour. Recently I went to grab some coffee at B&N; and wanted to read a book on Ireland. Popped open my Nook, connected to the B&N; network (already programmed into your nook for ease), selected the book I wanted to read from the list I searched on, and wam-bam I was reading a book. You can read lots of books on one Nook from their online selection without having to lug 20 actual books that you wanted to compare before you bought.In closing on this review I would say first and foremost do your homework. Go to B&N; or BestBuy and try out the Kindle, Nook and even the Sony Reader. Some will really like the touch screen of the Nook compared to the touchpad of the Kindle, but it's all in what you like. Some will like the fact you can Lend books and some won't.I'm sure I've missed out on something that others would like to know about the product before buying, so if you have any questions please contact me back here on Amazon and I'll try to get to you as quickly as possible.",4.0,"Great Item, But Does Have a Few Flaws",1293926400,"01 2, 2011",Electronics,1.0

My mother-in-law requested an ereader for Christmas. She didn't have a specific brand in mind and I knew next to nothing about them at the time so I started researching. Of course, it didn't take long to narrow it down to the Nook and the Kindle. I told my husband that I really didn't think we could go wrong with either one of the two. However, I decided on the Nook because it has several options (lending books to others, a brick and mortar store to go to with questions, the touch screen...)that the Kindle doesn't offer.Of course, all of this got me to wanting an e-reader of my own. After a few weeks, I ordered my own Nook and I could not be happier. The negative reviews on here really amaze me. I have found the device to be very easy to navigate and understand. There is a slight learning curve to with the different controls and which buttons do what but that is to expected. The fact that I can have a new book to read in a matter of seconds and I can store them so easily all in one place is fabulous! My mother-in-law loves hers as well and has not had any problems. We've had to contact customer service only once and the representative was quick and helpful.I use mine every day and I do have to charge the battery every 3 days. So, I charge it! Big deal! Also, as some others have stated, the touch screen can be a bit slow however, I fail to see why either of these is such a problem for some. These are certainly not deal breakers in my book!The web browser is pretty useless. Again, NOT a deal breaker at all! If I want to browse the web, I'll use my laptop!

Morales,"[7, 7]","With these new ereaders on the market, the act of reading has come back to be a very ""in-style,"" technologically advanced and hip thing to do in 2010. Books are now less intimidating and more fun and convenient, and this becomes only more encouraged through Barnes and Noble's Nook.Now, to cut to the chase, the Nook can do most things that the Amazon Kindle can do as well, and while the Kindle holds some ground over the Nook, on an overall scale, if you're looking for a better and more convenient ereader, I'd say to go for the Nook.Both the Kindle and Nook have clear displays, but overall, I would say that the Kindle's display seems to have better resolution. The Kindle also beats the Nook on battery life (as you'll notice that the Nooks battery life seems to last about a week, whereas the Kindle about a month, this is due to the draining power of the Nook's light-up touch screen menu). People may also prefer the button keyboard operation of the Kindle over the Nooks sometimes annoyingly sensitive or not-sensitive-enough touch screen. The Kindle is also thinner and lighter than the Nook. Both have mp3 features though, which helps them. It's always great to be able to read to your favorite music.Now, while it may seem in this paragraph the Kindle has the Nook easily beaten, one must look deeper into finding out why the Nook is a better choice. The reason the nook beats the Kindle is easy - in its navigation, presentation and overall ease of use.The biggest problem with the Kindle (that I noticed) is that the Kindle seems to want to have the look and feel of navigating like a laptop computer in the way it presents the main menu and font size, style and book selection. The problem with this is one thing - this is NOT a computer, it's a portable book, and Barnes and Noble knows this, and made their unit feel way less like just another annoying technological gadget but instead with a ""browsing bookstore"" type of presentation. This is a very BIG difference between the two, and you can sense it even after just a few minutes of toying with it. And this is only talking about the OLDER Nook, I can only imagine how much more amazing of a presentation the color Nook can get with all of its full color pictures and extras.On top of this, the Kindle seems to have placed the turn-page buttons way too attached to the ends, so you actually end up hitting the buttons by accident way too often, whereas the Nooks buttons are more of a soft ""bendable plastic"" type, so you never hit them by accident. This, on top of the little things like being able to slide your finger on the touch screen to turn pages as well as getting book covers and previews, daily logs, etc, give the nook an overall more ""coffee house"" feel which the Kindle doesn't even come close to. And even though the Nook is bulkier and heavier, it actually is made of a more durable softer rubber-like material, and along with the white paneling it makes it feel overall way more professional and studious. Not to mention just more attractive and stylish. This is easily the hipper of the two ereaders. Therefore, things like slightly longer load times, heavier feel, sometimes annoying touch screen and slightly higher price are actually very tolerable once you pick up both units and see and feel the overall difference.Books are an old-fashioned type of entertainment, and while the Kindle tries to make reading and literature just another tacked on 21st century technological piece of unrelatable modernized hardware, the Nook walks the perfect line of bringing the ""old-fashioned"" hobby of reading to a hipper style for the 21st century without taking away the studious professionalism of reading or disrespect the art of literature either. The transition is so much smoother on the Nook that you'll forget you're even reading off of an electronic device.",4.0,"Nook BEATS the Kindle Overall, Reading Revived!",1292544000,"12 17, 2010",Electronics,1.0

My three year old knocked it off the couch arm one day and it messed the screen up completely, even though it was in a case. Otherwise, I can't think of any issues I've had with this product. I've tried the Kindle and Pandigital ereaders, but neither one compares with the Nook. It's pretty close to perfect.",5.0,I'm hooked on the Nook,1322006400,"11 23, 2011",Electronics,1.0

I had been looking only at the Kindle, only because of their advertising, and was still sort of leaning in that direction.  The reason I have the Nook instead is very simple.  The day I decided to get a reader,  Best Buy was out of the Kindle.  So I went over to B&N; and bought the nook.  I am totally enjoying it.  I love that when I finish one book,  I have another waiting to be started,  without skipping a beat.  This is especially nice because I go back and forth to my daughter's frequently.  My grandsons love that I have a library just for them.  But that's true with any reader,  isn't it?I love that the staff at Barnes & Noble are very well trained and are able to help extreme novices such as me.  The store offeres workshops and classes too.  I had difficulty with a download not long ago.  The device said the book was there,  but it would not open for me.  Even though it was a free book,  I was given a gift card for my inconvenience.  Granted, the sum was small,  but it was still a nice gesture.When I showed HubbyDearest my reader,  he said he wanted one, so I gave it to him for Christmas.  Then he and I together gave our daughter one for her birthday.  Now my dear neighbor across the road from us is also interested in getting one.  What she doesn't know is,  her family is giving it to her for her 90th birthday.  They asked my advice about it.  I told them that she's bright,  had no trouble learning to use her digital camera,  and the nook is very easy to use too.  I know she's going to enjoy it,  especially being able to enlarge the print size.I find it very easy on the eyes; better than most paper pages,  and I can read for hours without fatigue.  If I could change one thing,  it would be the shiny frame around the page.  I would like it much better if the entire frame was the same matte finish like where the arrows are.  There is a good deal of glare there.  I'm used to it now,  but it might be a deal-killer for some people.The cover I got for myself, for hubby and for our daughter is black leather and closes with a zipper,  and there's a small zipper pocket on the front.  I have found the pocke to be very handy.  I keep my B&N; membership card, gift card and a couple of dollars in there.  There's also room for my driver's license and bank card if I want to travel light.  It's also the cover that my neighbor will be getting with her nook.Some reviews mention that the nook is heavier than some other readers.  That may be so.  But it's still lighter than the majority of books, and I don't find it uncomfortable to hold.September 24, 2011  Update:  I am still enjoying this reader, and find that I am able to read for longer periods of time with the NOOK than I can with regular books.  Probably one reason is the adjustable print size.  However,  today I made a discovery that was a great disappointment to me.  I decided to try out the audio book feature,  as there are times that I am busy with my hands,  but would still enjoy listening to a book.  So I downloaded an audiobook from the library.  First,  the volume is very low unless you are using earphones.  This actually was not a huge problem because would typically be using earphones anyway. The big problem is that the device does not bookmark where you stop in the audio book.  Instead, it kicks you all the way back to the beginning when you exit, leaving you to hunt for where you left off when you return.  I called Barnes & Noble and asked if this is the way they were supposed to be, was there something I need to do differently, or is there something wrong with my reader.  I was hoping to be told there is way to command it to hold the place.  The associate I talked to was not able to answer,  but she did take my number and promised to return my call as soon as she found out.  In only a few minutes later another associate called me back and said that what I was experiencing was the way the are.  When you stop listening to the audio book and exit out to do something else with the reader...for instance,  shop, read a newspaper, go to the library, visit my documents, etc.  it will automatically reset you back to the beginning.  So, folks, if you are looking for an easy way to have audio books,  this ain't it.  I can download books into my iPod instead, and hopefully have a better chance of picking up where I left off.As I said,  I do still enjoy it as a reader,  and still recommend it for that.  But if you want a user-friendly audiobook feature,  keep on looking.",5.0,I'm Lovin' It!,1307404800,"06 7, 2011",Electronics,1.0

If you put them side by side, you notice that the kindle is a fraction of the thickness, turns pages faster, is easier to navigate (mediocre touch screen on the nook), has several times the battery life, and has much better contrast than the nook. The nook does have a slight advantage in terms of ""extras"" with a mediocre internet browsing feature and some small applications like sukdo or chess. However, and this was the real killer for me, the kindle can display word documents natively while the kindle can not. Also, the prices seem to be slightly better on amazon for most of the books I have looked at (Sci-Fi) and amazon's website is much easier to navigate then B&N;'s.The biggest problem though with the nook is barnes and noble. They shipped me a unit with a defective battery and agreed to replace it but never sent it. Three months later, 6 promises to send a battery, a complaint filed with the BBB, and there is still no record of them ever having shipped the battery on their computers aside from the one they sent ""somewhere in colorado"" but can't find any record of what address that might be too. Of course, they stock the batteries in every physical store but you could never simply walk in and pick up the replacement no matter how incompetent their phone support is. From all of my interactions and my friend's experiences with B&N;, this is a common experience with them and undermines whatever they manage to accomplish in terms of producing a decent product.Bottom line: The nook beat the 2nd kindle, but is terrible compared to the 3rd generation of kindle.*note: All software was up to date as of March 2011 on the nook, but still performed worse than the kindle",2.0,Good until compared to a kindle,1301702400,"04 2, 2011",Electronics,0.0

Being electronically challenged, she immediately plopped it in my lap with instructions to ""Buy me a book"". As the nearest B&N; store is 30 miles away I elected to follow the B&N; site to my PC, to the Nook route.  Opening an account on the B&N; site, purchasing a book and downloading it to my PC was easy and fast. Prices are about half that of a printed version. Passing it along to the Nook was another matter.  The Nook came with virtually no usable instructions, either printed or electronic, to explain the procedure that I wanted to use.  After going back to the B&N; site I discovered a little free program called ""Nook for PC"". After downloading that program I was able to copy the book from my PC to the Nook. Everything works fine now, and my wife is addicted to the thing, she takes it everywhere. She still will not, however, try to load new purchases on the Nook.We now have three copies of every book we have purchased, one on the B&N; site, one on my computer, and one on the Nook. With one Nook, it is pretty hard to share after she finishes, and although I can read the books on my PC, that just is not comfortable or practical.

Walmart has one or two for under $120, one for under $90 that some people like.The Nook is a good option if all you want is a book reader.

The NOOK Color has many features that appealed to me like touchscreen, vivid view technology, brightness adjustments, really nice web browser and mp3 player, etc. So I decided to order one with BlueProton cause they ship it to Canada, and I paid 60 dollars more than the actual price at B&N; and expedited shipping taxes on top of that. I didn't care, I just wanted my NC cause honestly I'm just tired of buying AAA batteries for my Clip light to read my Kindle 3 in bed. I noticed I never read in bright sunlight, I'm an indoors type of reader and I also like to browse while I read, mostly wikipedia and google and the Kindle we browser is primitive.Anyways, I got the NC promptly, I was super excited, but then I tried to transfer my epub books to it and noticed that my computer didn't recognize the unit's drive. Nothing popped. I had my iphone and my kindle plugged in and they were right there. I went to a friend's house and nothing popped on his computer either. A third try at a different laptop and same thing: nada. I went back home and kept trying and all of a sudden I started seeing smoke coming out of the USB port and a smell of burned toast. Really strong. I knew that unit was gone and that freaked me out. Everything else worked perfectly, but the USB was pooched. I returned it and they were very professional about it, but said that they found nothing wrong with the device. I bet they just reset it and tested ome of the features without actually testing its hardware. Anyways, I said I didn't want that unit back. Now here I am, with no Nook Color, nobody else sends it to Canada. I'm contacting friends in the US so I can send it to them, buying it straight from B&N; and then they can mail it to me. It's just weird that at this day and age we still can't have items shipped internationally, even when we're willing to pay more money for that luxury.Now I'm again using my Kindle like crazy, since it's all I got and it never fails. But I'm still gonna buy the NC no matter what. I just don't know if I'll sell my Kindle 3 in the future or keep it because it has sentimental value now, hehe.I think that for 249 US dollars, the NC is the best e-reader in the market. Right now the Kindle still leads and the iPad is coming strong, but 2011 will be the year the Nook Color will establish itself as a great competitor for these other two. If Amazon doesn't come up with a color Kindle with touchscreen, I strongly believe they will be the Betamax and VHS of the 2000s. But I really like the Kindle and if they came up with something like a reader's tablet, I would use it instead of using B&N;'s. However, that still hasn't happened and Jeff Bezos says he doesn't want that to happen just now.

I usually only kept books that I really liked and donated the others to the library. With the nook color I can store up to 3,500 books on my nook or I can  store them on the SD card. This is one of the reasons why I decided to purchase the nook instead of the amazon kindle. I was not sure that an SD card could be used on the amazon kindle. Plus with the nook color you can add your own music or pictures onto the SD card and upload onto your nook color. I love the fact that it has wireless internet access, which can also be turned on or off to conserve battery power. Also with the nook color you can download magazines onto it to read. It can also be rotated lengthwise for a better when on the internet, however this feature does not work when reading a book but does work when viewing magazines. It has the pandora app pre-loaded onto to it so you can listen to music if you already have a pandora account with no commericals and comes with a couple of games. With the recent software up load BN has made more games and apps available for purchase. BN also has free books for downloading and on fridays if you type in free fridays into the BN search bar you can download the free book of the week. However, in mentioning the latest software update the one thing I do not like about it is that it came with a sample copy of the goodhouse keeping cookbook that to my knowledge no one has been able to figure out how to remove. So basically if you buy a nook color when it updates to the latest software version you likely to be stuck with that sample copy. In order to download onto your nook you have to set up a BN account and have a credit card stored to do that or you will have to go through the BN website each time to buy a book. The nook color allows you to customize your wallpaper which is similar to a desktop background, has the library feature which will show your books, magazines, newspapers, the myshelves feature which allows you to sort your books into categories like mystery or author etc... It has a shop feature specifically to fast access to the BN website, a web feature, apps feature with games & music, and then the settings. I have found the nook color very easy to operate and am very pleased with my purchase.

I can use it it to display my portfolio (I'm an artist who didn't want to spend $500 on an iPad and wanted something that fit in my purse).2. The Nook Color is the only e-Reader you can read in the dark without a book light. This is VERY handy when you want to read discretely. (Such as at a teacher inservice...) All you do is set the background to ""night"" (black), then lower the brightness, and you don't have that glow that shows you're up to something. (I got many jealous looks from other teachers.)3. If I have a problem with it, (which I did; the software was outdated), you get to work with REAL PEOPLE! All you have to do is take it into your nearest Barnes and Noble and they'll work on it--and it didn't take long and they were very friendly.4. The touch screen was easier to navigate than the Kindle when I tested it out against a Kindle at a Wal-Mart.Basically, with a Nook Color, you're getting an eReader that can do everything a tablet can except create documents. (It doesn't run MS Office, etc.) But you can listen to music, watch videos, play games, store and display photos, and of course, read books and documents.Now the only downside:1. The battery life is only good for about 8 hours. But who has time to read for more than 8 hours a day? I know I don't so I just plug it in every-other day before bed.2. The LCD screen does have a glare. (This, however, can be minimized by increasing the brightness when in bright light--so not really much of a problem.)I will tip my hat to the Kindle and I think that if I get a second e-Reader that has a longer battery life, I'd like to get the Kindle with 3G/WiFi.",4.0,Great for Artists!

The Kindle is a great device, but I really wanted a color screen.  The iPad would have been a nice option, but was a bit expensive for my taste and a bit too large.  The myriad Android tablets on the market don't seem to get great reviews, though I suspect that will start to change once Android 3.0 is available.The Nook Color was a nice alternative.  Priced a little higher than some of the no-name Asian tablets, but far less than the iPad.  It supports multi-touch, has a decent color display, and the ability to insert micro SD cards into a slot near the ""loop"" on the bottom.Because it supports both ePub and PDF out of the box, you can find a nice selection of books to download (legally) on the web and read on the device without additional investment.  The Barnes and Noble site also offers a limited, but growing, selection of electronic books (both free and for-a-price).  If you get tired of reading, you can use the built-in WiFi and browser to surf the web.  You can also play a couple of the built-in games, with the promise of more coming in a future update from Barnes and Noble.My only complaints so far about the device are that the far edges of the touchscreen seem a little unresponsive, the micro-USB connector is a non-standard type that seems to require use of the proprietary cable.  The connector on the device itself seems to make poor contact with that cable, which makes it difficult or impossible to read on the device while it's charging.Apart from that, battery life has been really good.  I rarely have to plug it in before I am finished reading for the day.The built-in web browser works well, displaying pretty much any web site that an iPad or Android phone can handle.The WiFi seems to find and hold on to signals well, and I don't recall it dropping a connection so far.If you take the time to learn how to ""root"" the device, you can add the Android Market to it and many apps (like the Kindle app) work very nicely on it.  This gives you the best of both worlds in a sense... The ability to buy eBooks from Amazon and Barnes and Noble, while keeping your color display.As far as eye strain goes, I work at computers 8 or more hours a day on the job and more when I get home.  I find the Nook's display easy to read for hours at a time and don't feel that my eyes are any more strained than when I read a printed paper book.  But your mileage may vary.  If e-Ink works better for you, the Kindle is a great alternative.I like the ability to highlight parts of the books I'm reading, take notes inside the book as I read (e.g., to highlight particularly good dialogue, characterization, description, etc., as a writer), and to post updates to Twitter and Facebook about your progress through a book.All in all, this was my favorite 2010 Christmas gift and has (for me) eliminated any desire to own an iPad or any other eBook reader.",4.0,Very nice eReader with tablet functionality,1298073600,"02 19, 2011",Electronics,1.0

I'm using it much more than I thought I would. Most of the time I use an aftermarket Android OS (CyanogenMod) booting off a micro SD, there's no need to root or jail break the stock firmware to do this. With the aftermarket firmware, it also has Bluetooth, the micro USB can be used as a host USB with an adapter or USB gender changer, and it will charge the battery while plugged in to a PC's USB, normally it will only charge with the wall charger.My biggest complaint with the stock firmware is B&N;'s app store, the apps are fairly pricey, apps that are free elsewhere you have to pay for, there are a few free apps from B&N; but not many. With the aftermarket firmware I'm using the Amazon app market, much better selection and prices.Cons: The sound is about what I expected, fairly poor, but is greatly improved by using an amplified external speaker. The micro SD slot is in a very poor location making it very difficult to insert and remove, it's located under a hinged cover behind the loop in the lower left corner, it's well protected there, just not easy to access.

At first, it wouldn't start up for no apparent reason. I'd get crazy messages and images on the screen, but no access to function. I went online to see if other buyers had the same problems and possibly solutions. They did. Lots of complaints and a few helpful suggestions. The things I had to try were a nuisance but they worked when I was persistent. I learned to fuss around and get the thing started. Then the charger started failing. I'd have to position it a certain way and weight it down when it was attached to the NOOK. That worked for awhile. After awhile, it seemed clear that something was wrong with the connection so I bought a Nook-compatible charger from Amazon. Good news. It worked. Bad news. It worked for only a week. I called Nook Customer Service. They said I really needed a Barnes & Noble brand charger. So I laid out another $15 or so. That charger worked for about 3 days.Now the EEG for my Nook has flat-lined. No web advice and no Customer Service advice helps. However, in my last conversation with B&N;, they told me to take it into a B&N; bookstore and have them look at the device. This will be my last ditch effort. If further measures require an investment of more than 10 cents, I'll tell them to pitch it in recycle.I wouldn't have hung in nearly as long if it hadn't been for a NOOK game I'm addicted to and can get nowhere else.

The impression I got from B&N;'s webpage was that it was for all ebooks.  This was the main reason why I picked these up instead of waiting for the Kindle Fire to be released.  Major disappointment.-Charger cable sucks.  The cable itself is weak where the usb adapter attaches to the cable, and is very easy to bend and break.  one cable is now broken at that spot, and the other is close to it.  These cables are easily replaceable, so not a huge deal, but I expected better quality...  Also, the power adapter is quite bulky.-did not update automatically.  I had to manually install the most recent update (allowing me to disable internet, and install netflix). it was relatively easy to do, following directions from B&N;'s webpage, but there should be a way to check for updates from the device itself.-loses battery life fairly quickly while on standby.-no free games & limited games (maybe apple spoiled me...)-prices for apps and books seem generally higher than on my kindle (I have not made direct comparisons, this is just my general impression)I will try and see if I can lend books through my local library; this may allow me to use it more for it's intended purpose.Overall, the device itself is quite good- just not for what I had intended it for (in store reading- with the option to purchase the book, in print, from the store).If I had purchased the device for myself, however, it would have been returned.  My kids do enjoy reading on it, playing angry birds, watching netflix, etc. so I will keep it for their use.Edit:The nook colours use a usb longer than a standard micro usb; a standard micro usb cable will not charge the nook colour.  I did contact B&N; (I initially took my nooks into a B&N; store for assistance, and was referred to their tech support 1-800 number.  So much for the in store tech support...)

It can be rooted in about 2 minutes to have app store.  Once that is done, You can use a home screen alternative and program to switch it to hide the overbearing and hindering B&N; store.  It's still there but, not right in my face. Default browser is OK  but, I prefer Dolphin HD.  It's much more than half and Ipad at exactly half the price.  Plus, when used as a reader, it's just light and small enough to be effective at that purpose.  I had a Pandigital novel that I got for Xmas that completely died in 3 weeks.  I took the refund money and made the smartest purchase that I can remember making:  The Nook Color.  The novel is pure garbage compared to this device.  Android 2.1 is so much better than 1.6.  I also couldn't get many apps to run on the novel  where this runs almost everything. Spend the extra $ and get the color.  Save the extra money from the Ipad. I was considering Archos 70 but, I couldn't find anywhere to actually play with it.

Couple of small annoyances: randomly reboots instead of sleeping, wireless doesn't come back up sometimes after rebooting.  Still very happy with it though. Sleep issue apparently also happens to those who haven't rooted.  I'm sure it will be fixed with update.UPDATE:  I am very unhappy with Barnes and Noble's many attempts to update my firmware without my permission.  They have tried twice and didn't succeed.  I believe that AVG antivirus is stopping it.  They got my girlfriend's and we have the same nook, that came with same firmware, that was flashed with same mod.  The only thing I can think of was AVG must have stopped it.  They got hers weeks ago and mine is still fine.  She wasn't running AVG and mine was.

It is heavy and slippery. The capacitive touch is not perfect, and the narrow metal rim of the screen ensures one ends up touching the screen and changing things inadvertently. There is only one option for a page turn; lefties beware. The battery life is far shorter than the time necessary to read a medium length book, and the plug-in is at the bottom of the unit. Since the cable is specific to the NC, I hated to risk bending/breaking it as I can imagine it is pricey to replace so plugging in the unit usually meant it was time to put the unit down for a LONG time while it recharged. I traveled with this unit, and it did not get me from one airport to the next on a charge. A lot of the ebooks I own are in .pdb format, which B&N sells, but the NC does not read. I was having problems with the unit not doing the motion side-turn and read thingy, and B&N pretty well ignored me. The local manager reminded me that used units are no longer subject to help. (The concept of the unit being less than 4 months old when it died, and turned on twice before I bought it, didn't bear any weight.) A local computer repair guy charged me $60 for absolutely no help at all; apparently the NC is far too complicated for anyone but a B&N repair person which never bodes well.

My favorite is the kindle fire...1.) poor customer service from barnes and noble - the cable breaks easily, and this device is not compatible for swaps... what I mean is like on the kindles you can basically switch out the cables for any micro usb cable... nook color you can not do that... once your nook color is out of warranty, they will no longer replace the cable, so if it breaks, your like SOL until you buy another one for $19.95 + shipping + tax... The cable is really cheap and breaks to easily... I think each time I've had a new cable replaced I could only get it to last about 2-3 uses before it broke... it keeps breaking at the N...2.) the updates are horrible... basically you will have lag issues and the battery will drain easy if you don't update... actually after a while the battery will just start draining anyways and you can't keep charge...3.) it takes forever to turn on... you have to wait like 5 minutes and keep holding the power button and then like another 5 minutes to boot up... with kindle it turns on almost instantly.... After a while, you still have to wait about a minute for the kindle to boot up, but it still loads quicker than the nook color.4.) a feature i like is that the volume buttons are on the side... with kindle fire, you have to dig around to find them... they are in the settings... like you can only adjust the volume on kindle fire through the settings...5.) another feature i like is the card expansion slot. i like to store avi movies from my camcorder and what not on them, and you can't do that with the kindle fire.6.) check each stores content before you buy. each ereader loads different files... this is the main reason i bought both. Most of my textbooks for school are only available through barnes and noble, but I prefer to read on the kindle. After I'm done with school, I'm going to be selling my nook color, but I refuse to get rid of my kindle fire, unless they update to one that has the volume buttons on the side, and plossibly a card expansion slot.

It's just I wish that amazon would just carry all the textbooks I need, so I don't have to keep going to b&n...;So, other than the software is a tiny bit easier to navigate around, i'd prefer kindle fire over nook any day... just because I get longer lasting supplies and better customer service.",1.0,Do not buy!!!! buy a kindle instead,1337817600,"05 24, 2012",Electronics,0.0

The Kindle was always too expensive and, even now, I don't like the way the screen flashes when ""turning"" pages. After playing around with many different readers, over a period of several weeks, I finally decided to pick up a Nook a couple of months ago.One of my big considerations is that I wanted to be able to read .pdf files in color. The Nook easily satisfied that requirement. What I was expecting; however, is how FANTASTIC the Nook is after Android is installed on it. A friend of my just bought a new iPad 2 and showed it to me a couple of days ago. That, of course, is a wonderful device but VERY expensive. I started to look around the 'net and found that the latest Android Operating System, Honeycomb, can be installed on a micro-SD memory card and that this will allow the Nook to run the new OS. Even better, by simply removed the micro-SD card, the Nook returns to it's normal state and continues to run as before.I had NO IDEA how powerful the Nook Color really is until I installed Honeycomb on it. The Nook is now so great that it behooves me that B & N doesn't simply place Android on the Nook as the default OS! Yes, it's its that good! Just one word of caution. As using Honeycomb doesn't require that the Nook be rooted, it is a bit tricky to install but that's only due to the HORRIBLE instructions that the geeks who discovered how to put Android on the it. (As a rule, Geeks are usually incapable of writing in known-human languages.) I don't know if the warranty is voided by running Honeycomb but, as all that needs to done to get rid of it, is remove the micro-SD card, I suspect that no one will know.All in all, the Nook Color was already a great device but adding Honeycomb makes it AMAZING!",5.0,All I can say is WOW!!!,1300665600,"03 21, 2011",Electronics,1.0

It's also wireless only.The backlit LCD screen is spectacular and I find it was better on my eyes for reading than I expected. However, I find that finding ebooks on B&N;'s site is harder than Amazon and I cannot find many inexpensive or the oodles of free ebooks like for Kindle. Lots of ebooks promoted on B&N;'s Nookstore are $4.99 - $9.99 or more. Too expensive, IMO. Seems like fewer Indie Authors on there in the $2.99 price range :(I decided to take a chance and rooted my new Nook Color which requires a micro SD card (I used a 2G card). It requires the ability to follow some technical steps that took me about 15 minutes total. I am not a major Geek, but I've been online for 15 years and know basic stuff like HTML (not needed for this) and moving files and some troubleshooting if I get stuck. The Rooted Nook is a bit quirky. While the original B&N; e-reader functionality is still there, I had to install a couple apps (launcher app and Softkeys) to toggle between the Android and B&N; screens.I CAN watch YouTube and surf the web easily. I also downloaded the Amazon Kindle app to my rooted Nook, and read my 100+ Kindle books on it (and get my freebies too!). You can't view Flash or use Hulu or Netflix (yet!), but maybe flash will work with the next B&N; update. note that a Nook Color doesn't have a mic or bluetooth to use with certain Android apps. A bummer for me because I like to dictate texts and emails on my phone using Nuance's FlexT9 app.Overall, my kids **love** the Android side of the rooted Nook Color, and I like getting some useful apps on a much bigger screen. So now we fight over it. Will I get rid of my Kindle -- no way. But I find the Nook Color becoming more my at home reader with the Kindle app on it, and my Kindle device turning into an away from home, travel e-reader.",5.0,Moved Over to the Dark Side From Kindle,1303344000,"04 21, 2011",Electronics,1.0

An sold all the kindles over the last few years. Kindles are nice for reading books but lack in a few areas. First screen size. Kindles for me are either to big or small.

I was a little hesitant at first to switch from paper books to an eReader. I was worried that it would feel like reading from a computer screen and strain my eyes. However, I have had no issues with this. Some of the features that I really like: It has a slender design for easy portability and fits nicely in my purse. It has pretty good battery life. I find the ""look up"" feature to be very handy. When I'm reading and come across a word  with which I'm not familiar, I can simply touch and hold the word on the screen, tap look up, and it quickly brings up a definition. Images on the screen are clear, and the volume is adequate. I also like that when I bring up a book, it automatically brings up the last page I was reading. Another convenient feature is the backlight. This feature is handy for those nights when I can't sleep, and my husband is snoozing away. Again, it isn't so bright that it glares and hurts my eyes, but not so dark that I have to strain my eyes. I have had no problems connecting to to WiFi, and the speed is adequate for watching Netflix and YouTube videos. Over all I am very pleased with this product. The negatives that I have found are minimal.  The Nook Friends application isn't very helpful. One of the reasons that I my husband chose Nook over Kindle as a gift was for the Nook Friends feature. This feature is a bit misleading. I set up my account, only to learn that not all books are lendable and they can only be lent to 1 friend and only for 14 days. I was very disappointed in this application. The only other negative that I can think of is that if you accidentally touch the screen, which is easily done, it will turn the page prematurely or bring up text options over the text that you're reading. Overall, I think this is a very good product and would recommend it. In fact, I just purchased one for my best friend for Christmas.",4.0,Good Product,1354665600,"12 5, 2012",Electronics,1.0

The back light is a great feature and the color is vibrant. The read-aloud children's books are awesome and it comes with 2 already downloaded. It is fairly user-friendly. There are no paper instructions included, so until a representative at BN told me, I did not know that the manual was actually ON the device. There are not many accessories available yet for the device, as it is so new. I had a hard time finding a cover for it that I liked. Most of them are ""old people"" looking. I ordered one that will be released in February. A cover is a must-have, as you wouldn't want it to be damaged. A screen protector is also a must. They are very expensive at BN, so I recommend ordering off Amazon. Even though the shipping costs more than the protectors, it is still cheaper than BN. The selection of free-downloads is somewhat limited. They are not high-interest to most people. I would guess that as the device evolves, things will improve. A rep at BN told me that the updates will automatically appear on the device and be free. Also, you CANNOT register or start-up this device unless you have wireless/wifi access. This definitely beats the Kindle - no matter what my mom says (we had a Kindle v Nook war/discussion ;) The keyboard alone on the Kindle sucks -- it's hard plastic, whereas the Nook is touch screen. Come on, Kindle, it's almost 2011! This is only 1 of the many, many features, and a small one at best. (Not to mention the expandable memory that the Nook has). By the way, the rumor that you can only buy books from BN for the Nook isn't true -- you can download onto your PC and sideload onto your Nook!

The overall product will still be the same, but some things (like the instruction manual) might be different.---------Reading: It's a nice clean picture & the backlit screen isn't too annoying, but I have a feeling that people will be feeling the eyestrain later. If you're looking to buy this for reading at length, you'll need to be aware of this. You can change the brightness of the page, but that doesn't change that ultimately you're still looking at a backlit screen.Downloading: Pretty fast download times, although I only downloaded the free samples from the storefront. (Hilarious since I work at a Books-A-Million & the storefront's B&N.; We're so going to lose money on ebook sales.)Internet: Pretty decent. I pulled up facebook & the page is crisp, clear & loads quickly. I also went onto failblog, a site with quite a few side ads. It was a little on the slow side, but that's to be expected on stuff like this. You can also pull up videos on youtube, so that's a bonus.Battery: Not bad, but obviously won't last as long as the Nook or some of the e-ink units out there. You'll get about 3-4 hours if you leave the wifi on. Not sure about the non-wifi battery life right now, but since the company says it's 8 hours I'd say it's probably about 6-7 hours.Extras: You can change the font, screen background color, & a few other things. While that's nice, I couldn't help but feel a little underwhelmed by it. There's also the option to be able to toggle back & forth between the publisher default & your aesthetics of choice. You can also change the background on the main page of the NookColor, which is a nice touch. Since we're not supposed to change that with our store unit, I wasn't able to play with that any.Touch Screen: It's OK. Pretty easy to use, but a few times I found myself really having to wrestle with it to turn pages. Sometimes it would be too sensitive & I'd end up a few pages ahead of where I wanted to be. Not a deal breaker, though. It didn't happen enough to where I'd get overly irritated, but people who are all thumbs with touch screens will be irritated.User Friendly: It's not very intuitive to use. People savvy with e-readers & gadgets will be able to figure it out pretty quickly but people who are new to the scene will be pretty confused with everything. The unit for my store didn't come with any written directions- it was all on the unit. That means that if it's like this on the sale unit then that won't be all that helpful for the people who aren't able to navigate well on the unit.Overall: My opinion is that it's OK, but not exceptionally so. Go for the iPad if you really want something like this. (I know it's more expensive, but if you're willing to pay $300 then paying $500 might not be that much of a difference.) It's basically a Nook/iPad hybrid, but without the option for all of the extras & apps. (Of course if all you want is an e-reader & wouldn't use the iPad's extras, then this is great.) Overall it isn't a bad unit but it just doesn't have anything to really make it stand out. If you're a big fan of the Nook then go for this unit, but I'd play with it in the store first.The only two things that really make this stand out from the other e-readers on the market is that the unit is in color and that the internet on this unit is far better than some of the other options on the e-reader market. While the color option is great for children's books & magazines, this might not be enough for users who predominantly use their readers for plain print reading & that the ones who would want these things might already have it in the various tablets that are on the market.I did enjoy playing with the unit in my store, but I don't know that I would choose it over the regular Nook. Of course this is just my opinion, but again- before making a big purchase like this, view a unit in the store first.3.9/5",4.0,"Not bad, but might not sway many users of other readers on the market",1290729600,"11 26, 2010",Electronics,1.0

I had low expectations; its less than half the cost of an Ipad or Tab after all.  As it turns out it runs really well once you get it going. The performance is surprisingly snappy and responsive. The only real hiccup is the mediocre video support.  There are some UI hits too since he version of Android its running is not tablet optimized.  If you're not afraid of voiding your warranty, this is the best bang for your buck as tablets go.I configured it so I could easily switch back to the default B&N; configuration.  Which, to my surprise, I'm using a lot. The ease of jumping in and out of a book makes me more likely to read. Its an LCD so you might get some eyestrain, but the viewing angles are amazing, the best I've seen on a handheld device. The childrens books are great too, although a bit expensive.  The magazine view is awesome too, it let's you keep up with your mags without killing trees.  The newspaper view is less impressive.  Its basically like Google reader with a fee.  Note that the Nook reading app that comes with the Nook is different than what you can download fro the Market and is much better.As for downsides, there aren't a lot.  The battery could be better as it typically only lasts a few days between charges under periodic reading and browsing (a couple of hours a day).  Watching videos kills the battery really quickly.  The speaker is on the back of the unit, so forget about setting it down when watching videos or anything with audio.I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a dedicated reader or a cheap tablet.

If you have no interest in hacking this device, then let me start with the ""stock"" review first.As an eBook reader, it is very good but not great.  eInk and its variants will always be the gold standard by which you measure a reading device, because the utility of such a display in daylight is unrivaled.  My hope is that in time, the Pixel Qi displays make their way into Kindles, Nooks, iPads, etc on such a large scale that this is no longer an issue.  Alas, it remains one, and it is a key criterion for many.  As an LCD touch screen, it is very bright and colors are rich, not saturated.  Touch sensitivity is a little rough, as is accuracy.  I did not see a calibration function.Wireless connectivity is very, very good but for some reason, will not connect with some routers.  The range is impressive, better than my Droid 2.  Speeds are very good, but I neglected a speedtest in this round.Integration with the B&N; store is very tight as expected.  The store app for the Nook is better than the Android app, necessarily: you can browse magazines and newspapers, for one thing.  Display of media is well-formatted and fairly intuitive; I never cracked the user manual or quick start guide (then again, I rarely do that for anything I buy). Prices are competitive with other vendors, and it does handle sideloading of books onto microSD cards.  By the way, 32Gb microSDs are supported.  I run with an 8Gb, and I've filled it mostly with music.And oh by the way, it plays music very well.  Some of you might listen to music while you read, and I am one of those weirdos.  This device, stock, will do just that.  Overall, I like this device, but would probably prefer eInk if I was buying it solely for reading media.However, I bought it for cheap tablet use.  In this regard, it has amazing potential.  Despite the fragmentation of custom ROM and rooting options, you can indeed settle on a Cyanogen ROM and find a lot of functionality on the cheap.  I can browse websites easily if I don't need Flash (currently not working on this ROM); I use PocketCloud to log into my home machines and I can work from there if needed.  I'd love to have Swype on this, or even Graffiti, but it is sufficient to have access to the Android Marketplace and all the attendant apps I have stored in the cloud.  There is no microphone or camera, so those apps have no place here, nor does GPS exist.  However, Bluetooth is available in Cyanogen nightlies so you can now try pairing it with headsets and keyboards.  Thus far, the potential is not fully realized but it perfectly suits my needs today.  With time, this will become a great tablet once Flash is fully operable and the Honeycomb ROMs are fully baked.Stock, 4 stars.

The Nook Color is a fun ""toy"" that not only is an e-reader but also a mini-tablet computer (or in my case a full tablet - keep reading to see how).Some of what I've discovered over the course of time:Battery: Nook Color - battery lasts me maybe 6-8 hours with usage. Longer if wifi is turned off and screen turned down. Kindle says it can go up to a month between charges for reading but with my constant use I get about 2 weeks with wifi off. The Nook Color's touchscreen and the Android system is what drains the battery on the Nook.Surfing the net: Nook color has the Kindle beat on this. Much easier with the touchscreen and color screen. Surfing the web on the Kindle 3 is a bit cumbersome using the directional keys but it does work.  The Kindle 3 I have has 3G so I can access the internet anytime at no extra cost.  The Nook Color only offers wifi so you must be in a wifi hotspot to access the internet.Barnes & Noble - has less books than Amazon. B&N; includes all the public domain books in their book count to make it seem like they are better but Amazon does not include those books and they still have more choices. Having both the Kindle 3 and Nook Color I have access to both stores.  My experience has been that Amazon has more and better free books than does Barnes and Noble by far.  Amazon is cheaper 99% of the time on the same book as well.  Nook Color has the ""Free Book Friday"" where they pick a book and offer it for free.  However I have found many times that the same book is free on Amazon as well so no leg up for Barnes and Noble on that one.Nook Color reads epub format, Kindle 3 the Mobi format.  As of now you cannot borrow books from an e-library on the Kindle 3 but can on the Nook Color.  This issue will be solved before the end of 2011 however and Kindle will be able to read epubs as well.  To get around the epub issue I downloaded Calibre on my computer and now am able to convert any epub to Mobi and can read ANY book of any format on my Kindle 3 with this program. However, any Kindle books you buy cannot be converted to work on the Nook Color due to the DRM formatting and B&N; does not always offer the same books for free as Amazon does.  Having my Nook Color booting as a tablet though also solves that issue as I now have the Kindle App on it so I can do both.  If your not going to run it as a tablet then the Kindle is more flexible with the Calibre program.I try to have all my books on both e-readers and find I head to my Kindle more than my Nook Color. However, when I want to read at night and not bother hubby with a light I find I grab the Nook Color as it has a backlit LCD screen and no light is needed.  The LCD screen does not cause eye strain and I get migraines and find it does not seem to bother me at all.My first purchase was the Kindle 3 and I bought it to just read books.  I then purchased the Nook Color to use as a tablet such as the Motorola Zoom/iPad etc since I do not have hundreds of $$$.  The Nook Color is a great cost alternative to those and I currently run the Android Gingerbread system off an SD card and double boot a menu to choose between a tablet and e-reader.  This keeps my warranty on the Nook Color valid as I've not changed the software on the Nook Color but just need to remove the SD card if warranty work is needed. Love this versatility!Overall, if you just want to be able to take multiple books with you in a light, compact package and use an e-reader for actually reading - then the Kindle 3 is what your looking for.If you want a tablet type e-reader and you don't mind it being a bit bigger and heavier with just wifi and no 3G coverage, with apps and games then the Nook Color is a good choice.  However, you are tied into the Barnes and Noble store which does not have as many good free books as Amazon and many of their books are priced higher than those on Amazon.Or do what I did and get both (ebay is great for the Nook Color).  I enjoy having them both!  And still for less than one Motorola Xoom or iPad!On Edit 8/20/2011:  This week decided to go to the beach.

The battery life only last 6-8hours. When I went to charge it since it didnt last long every hour it only charged 10-13%. It took me almost 10 hrs to charge. Not cool. I did however like the fact its a touch screen, but.. not having the buttons on the side to turn the pages was annoying. All I did was tap the screen lightly and the page turned, at times it would turn and I didnt want it too. My BIGGEST problem was the screen was too bright. I am the type of person who likes to read before I go to bed. I had my nightstand lamp on, the screen brightness turned all the way down and it was still to bright for me. It made me really sick. Also, it doesnt have 3G so if I am somewhere with no Wi-Fi I couldnt download a book. Big bummer there. so... Its a great idea being in color. I really wanted it to work, but wasnt for me.

It is not meant to be tablet or an iPad replacement.  It is foremost an e-Reader with some bells and whistles.If I'm given a choice, I would not buy a Nook.  For the price, I would rather get a Kindle Fire.  I own 4 laptops, 1 iPad 2 for my wife, and 3 Kindle Fires for my kids.  Nook Color is an afterthought and it is for me.  I bought my used Nook Color on another site for $114 (free shipping) 2 weeks ago.  And it was a steal.  The Nook I received was in working order and it looked new.I had no trouble turning it on and everything worked perfectly.  The only gripe was it was extremely slow compare to some of the tablets I own.  Again, I reminded myself that this is not a tablet so I had to be fair.  The features are not too bad but the navigation was confusing at best.Fast forward to today.  B&N; was smart to release an update (1.4.1).  If you already own a Nook Color, you should get the update.  The update improves the speed dramatically.  The navigation still lacks finesse though.Here are some of the goods- I bought it cheap- It has an expansion slot.  I inserted a 16GB micro SD card and Nook recognizes it right away.- The web works fine.  It can now even watch some YouTube.  It also runs Flash.  Nook 1, iPad 0.- The new update allows NetFlix to run.- There are some apps that are extremely useful.  I love the Smithsonian Channel and Pulse.- The magazines look great.  The update also improve the navigation.- The interactive books are great.  My daughter absolutely loves it.And now the bads- I constantly look for free stuff.  Unfortunately, B&N; doesn't offer a lot of free books that are worthwhile.- The apps itself, is sad to say the least.  The offering is a fraction of what you can find in iPad and Amazon.  And most of them are costly too.- While the update improve the speed of web-surfing, it still is slower than iPad and Kindle Fire.- The speaker is terrible.  It is located on the back of the device.  If you hold the Nook on your hand, you may cover the speaker. The best solution is to use a head phone.- The navigation overall needs to be improved. It is a basic Android without much thought.  At times I don't even know whether to double-tap or hold to get more options.Here is my final take.  If you are short on cash, and would like a good e-reader/tablet.  Go get a Kindle.  If you can find a Nook for less than $150. Go for it.I would not spend more than $200 on a Nook (be it a Color/Tablet).  There are much better options out there.Update January 24, 2012I have used my Nook for a month now and all in all, I like it because it allows me to read my magazines and books.  It sure beats a 10 incher tablet.  The update 1.4.1 is definitely a must if you want to use Nook Color to its full potential.  However, I found out yesterday that the update was actually used to close the loop on dual-boot and disable any sideload of apps.  The version 1.4.0 allows the Nook to load Amazon app and the Launcher EX.  Basically it allows other apps other than B&N; to be loaded.  The automatic update 1.4.1 disable this option.  So, if you are dare enough to install other apps, you can backdate the version to 1.4.0 if you want to load other apps.Update February, 2012Nook continues to lose to Kindle Fire in terms of contents.  B&N; could not match to the behemoth of Amazon and I don't think it will ever be.  However, if you are stuck with Nook, there are a few apps that you must have (they are all free).  It helps the Nook Color to be a good companion in a boring world.- NetFlix is a must.  7 inch on your lap and plug in a pair of headphones.  You are good to go.- Smithsonian is interesting.  Want to learn something that you forgot.  This app works great but contents updates are slow.- Dolphin Internet Explorer works great for anyone wants to do quick surfing.  Very fast and very convenient.- Don't know what interest you, try Stumbleupon.  It randomly pulls internet content based on your interest.  Works great on YouTube vidoes.- Good with words, try Nook Crossword.- Who doesn't use Dropbox.  It is a must.- Springpad is great to jot down quick notes.- Pandora works great too, but you need a pair of headphones though.- Who needs newspaper when you have Pulse.",4.0,Not a bad product and close to being perfect,1323820800,"12 14, 2011",Electronics,1.0

When I called Barnes and Noble and explained and described the problem their first questions were: 1)Did you purchase an extended warranty? 2)Did you drop the Nook or do anything else which could have caused the damage? My response to both questions was ""no"" to which the woman responded ""I am sorry, we do not warrant user caused damage"" to which my response was ""huh?""I attempted to reason a little with her to no avail--""If your assumption was going to be that I caused the damage, why did you even bother to ask the question?"" Well, the conversation went on for a little and it became clear to me that if one does not purchase the extended warranty, it is automatically assumed that any problem is the result of user damage and, in effect, there is no warranty at all.A month or so later I decided to take the preschooler approach--if Mom did not give me the answer I wanted I should ask Dad--so I called again thinking something may have been in error on my first try.

I just bought this Nook color tablet from Best Buy two days ago,  It's perfect.  After charging it, I drove straight to Barnes & Noble books to try their wifi and buy a few books. TRUST ME, THE Barnes & Noble bookstore employees know how to operate the Noook, and did a better job than Best Buy, at showing me how to use the Nook and answer my questions.  The set up and navigation is easy, and the user settings are user friendly. When reading books, I found that the bright white background screen was hurting my eyes.  So I lowered the brightness level down to half of the default setting.  Yes, you can adjust the brightness as well as the volume.  Nice Browser: when using the browser, it accesses the internet very quick.  While using the wifi in the B&N store, I accessed Hulu plus (The video website).  I was in the Barnes & noble store watching an episode of Law & Order.  HOW COOL IS THAT?  The weight is a little haavy in your hand when reading books, but no where near as heavy as the Kindle Fire.  The kindle fire was both thick & too heavy.  On the kindle fire's screen, I had to fight & tap several times to change screens. I grew frusrtated, took the kindle back to Best Buy the same day, and exchanged it for the Nook.  I'm so glad I did.  On the nook, changing screens only requires a smooth tap.

Now did you know that buying directly from B & N, the Nookcolor is actually $249? Also, for those who are concerned about the lcd, dont worry. You can adjust the brightness level. I lower it when I read at night in the dark, and when its daylight and I want more clarity, I can brighten it. You can use literature published in so many digital formats (but not amazon kindle format, which doesnt play well with others), and its just a pleasure to use. Someone mentioned that when you have it plugged for charging and try to type on the keyboard, it doubles the characters. Yeah, been there, done that, true story, so hopefully as they update the software, that will improve, but once you unplug, everything seems to work very nicely. If you want a nice reading environment, I really would recommend the nook color. It makes reading such a pleasure, at a very decent price for the product you are buying. I actually like that it has a tiny bit of ""weight"" to it. Now my little droid incredible, which had been my reader til I got the NookColor, feels so...light! Almost TOO light! And...it LOOKS so elegant. I actually prefer having the plastic/metal (not sure what it is actually, but it feels nice and looks nicer) bezel as opposed to the ipad glass to the edge type construction. It gives me a nice place to put my fingers. And get a nice cover for it. B & N has some very nice ones. Yes, some are a bit pricey, but I really think its worth the investment. Mine already has fallen to the carpeted ground when my dog figured I had been reading long enough, and wanted some attention. I was very glad I had it in a cover. However, with the bezel and the rubberized back, I dont think I would have had a heart attack if it fell uncovered. I would never risk that, but it looks and feels as though it could take a bit of a tumble without much trouble, at least onto carpet. It just seems less fragile than the ipad or galaxy tab.  The book collections are extensive, and I also had quite a collection of pdf books which I very easily downloaded. And I LOVE the free trial for the magazines. To discontinue any of them you decide you dont want, you have to log into your online nook account on the B $ N website, and find the ""manage subscriptions"" link. Took me a minute to figure that out, so hopefully that tidbit will save you some frustration. But overall, its a wonderful, colorful, very nice user experience. Its an ereader first and foremost, and it does that very well. It just happens to have a few lil extra goodies tossed in to boot! Dont compare it to the ipad. It isnt supposed to BE the ipad!

Consumer Reports gave it good reviews, so I decided that I wanted to give this device a try, and was glad my hubby got me it for Christmas.  I love it.  I am reading every day since receiving it.  I am not sure if there will be glare issues reading this outside as it is the dead of winter here in the North East, so I will update when the weather improves and I can sit outside and read on my porch again.  The navigation of this device is similar to my I-Pod touch with the touch screen to open and select a book and to turn pages in your book.

One of my favorite features is the fact that you actually can tell what PAGE you are on in a book instead of a section like on the Kindle.  The one negative would be the battery life could be longer.  You get about 8 hours on a charge vs. days of charge time with the Kindle.  It's not a super big deal, I just hope the battery lasts a long time after being recharged frequently.

With a little persistence, I got the screen protector on pretty decently with just a few tiny little pinhead bubbles on the edges.  The screen protector works great for the finger prints, and I actually do see less glare when reading with a light on.

There are plenty of arguments both ways on Amazon so I won't do more than my two cents. I have sold my NC and moved on.Major gripes: it locked up constantly during video playback. I do video and editing and file conversion regularly for my job and the device is very ""low-brow"" in it's use of codecs since it uses the Android OS and there aren't better video players available for the NC at this time. You have to run the simplest of conversions schemes (there are a lot of discussions on this online and you can find the correct converter- I used Handbrake) so quality lacks compared to other ""tablets"". Since this was one of my main uses of the NC, this is a killer for me. It is too frustrating having to restart it all the time.PDF viewing was terrible. There are better descriptions again on Amazon, but my problem was it never kept it's place and it sometimes would only give me the first page and not want to move on.Ebooks read great until the newest firmware, then got a bit ""sticky"" and less smooth on page turning and viewing.Apps are just plain awful right now, but I am sure it will get better.Expansion card access and use was not good, but you get used to it.

Emerson,"[10, 10]","EDIT - Update 1.4.1 (12/21/2011): BIG update rolled out on December 14th, with lots of big changes, most of which really improved the device.First, the ""n"" key, which originally functioned as a home key taking you back to the original home screen, now functions as the menu key instead, like on the new Nook Tablet. Prior, there was a softkey arrow that would bring up the menu function, and Barnes and Noble has moved that function to strictly hardware. I'm torn about whether I like this update, because honestly, I don't like relying just on a hardware key for something like a menu, especially with the issues I've had with Nook parts (I've owned two cords in the past year alone.) It does makes multi-taking easier, when switching from one application to another (say reading to internet), because you don't have to go to the home menu function first. For those of us Nook Color originals, it takes adjusting from old habits, but so far, it's not a bad change.The reader application functions in a much more friendly manner. The page numbers are on the bottom of the pages, instead of the top, in a much less chintzy font, and pulling up the menu tell you how many more pages are left in the chapter. Not really a necessary change, but kind of nice. There are some fonts added, along with FINALLY adding the option to change the tone of the page from white to sepia, night, or off-white. The books also read sideways now, in a two-page fashion, though I'll admit, I don't use that much, and won't, even with the ability to have it on something other than kids books. Just makes the actual reader app a much more rounded and friendly one.The magazine reader had a few changes that are nice. There are animations for the page turns now (though why they don't have that option with the books is a big of an in-congruency), though the animations disappear when you zoom in. The menu at the bottom pulls up the pages in miniature picture form, but are in a much more appealing, accessible manner. Rather Mac-esque, really. Nothing huge, but it makes it all more friendly-looking. Randomly, the magazine reading app is the only one where the ""n"" button is still a home button, and not a menu one. Wondering if they'll notice that and change it in the future.The PDF reader had some AWESOME changes. Before, reading PDF files was incredibly clunky, and did not resolve well on the screen at all. Reading a book involved zooming in and scrolling down, instead of sideways like the ereader application, and when you closed the PDF file, reopening would take you right back to page one, and never saved your last place. Ridiculously cumbersome, and not user-friendly at all. The new update not only saves your place, but it resolves the page so that the text fits better on the screen, and allows the pages to read much more easily sideways. It also scrolls sideways, instead of down, which just makes sense and follows with the overall expectations of the reading experience.Interestingly, enough, they still haven't resolved the issue of PDF files not having a cover when on the home screen or in the menu, even when the information is attached, which is something I was hoping they'd resolve. It's not a huge issue, but it's just a visual annoyance when all the EPUB files have cool graphics show up on the home screen, and PDF files just have grey with the title of the book. Lame.Overall performance of the menu functions and flipping between tasks seems zippier than it was before, and I really appreciate that. The menu functions seem much more efficient and smooth, and that just makes for a much better interaction.The ebook store also changed around, and B&N; completely reordered all the categories and changed the look. I can't say I appreciate all the changes they made, because you can no longer organize things like apps or books based on price, and instead have to search manually in the menu. I'm frugal, I'll admit. I miss the ability to find free apps easily, because let's face it, it just makes me happy.Overall, I love the update they rolled out, though! It's nice to know that B&N; is staying loyal to their original customers and keeping the devices updated.*  *  *EDIT 4/12/2011: Barnes and Noble did an update recently which fixed the glitches with the screen when plugged in, finally. I have not had any issues with the screen lagging or glitching since.*  *  *EDIT 2/28/2011: A new update now allows for Android apps and email on the Nook, which is exciting. I'm not all that into the apps they have, especially the games, but it's a nice touch! It has also fixed the issue of not being able to put your own books on the home screen, and the issue that the Nook was having with recognizing cover art for those books. I can now also put other apps on the home screen, such as the Email or Pandora app, which gives the entire thing a much freer, most customizable feel. Though apparently this update has cancelled out the last one, because the screen glitches when plugged in are back. Oh, well, I'm just happy to now be able to put my own books on my own home screen! Vast improvement right there!*  *  *Original review, from 12/2010:I received my Nook Color as a gift for an early Christmas, and have been using it for a few weeks now, enough time that I decided I can make an educated review.Pros/Cons-It has a great screen, with sharp resolution. Book title colors and wallpapers look sharp and clear, and the touchscreen is responsive. You can adjust the brightness, though I rarely found the need to adjust the brightness even a quarter of what it could be, since otherwise it was a bit too bright on the eyes. That being said, I found that when you plug it in to a power source and try and use it, the touchscreen goes crazy, and won't even perform simple tasks like unlocking the device. You can't flip to the next screen without several swipes, and turning pages can be a haphazard activity. That weird glitch doesn't affect the device at all when it isn't connected to a power source, but it's such a pain when the device is low on battery power and you want to read while it's charging.-The hardware on the Nook Color is nice, with a muted metallic finish on the front and back, which gives it a nice grip, though I immediately bought a cover, so the fact that it's somewhat grippy doesn't matter much any longer. The weight is nice, about the weight of a small hardcover book, which I found rather pleasant when holding. I still don't get the random open-hole thing in the lower left-hand corner, though. It's like you're supposed to use that to clip the device onto something, but I hardly thing someone is going to just clip it onto their keychain for convenience. It's clearly not awful-looking, but I guess it just seems kind of superfluous to me. Oh, well.-The battery life is surprisingly good. I don't have to WiFi on when I'm at home, and the device will go for several days on low-brightness. I actually had it on one charge for about 7 days one time, and was pretty impressed, considering other devices with LCD features tend to eat battery life like some kids eat Cocoa Puffs.-It's Android-based, which is great. However, B&N; doesn't allow any apps from the Android market, which is such a crime, considering that the tablet could be a fantastic tool if B&N; would open up the gates on that one. The fact that it's Android-based isn't really a selling point, it's more of a potential point to keep an eye on, one that hopefully the company will do more with down the road. The tablet does come with certain apps like Pandora and games like Sudoku, which will do in a pinch if you're bored.-It comes WiFi enabled, and it connects to networks easily and without issues. It does recognize B&N; WiFi hot-spots, and remembers them, which means that you don't have to reprogram the networks or worry about not being able to access the in-store features, which is really convenient. The browser is pretty decent, doesn't have flash, but performs very well. I actually used it for emails and checking my Facebook when I was out of town, and it was snappy and quick, though the fact that it doesn't have pinch/pull zooming features (which the picture gallery does, oddly enough) is a bit of a turn-off, because it can make browsing somewhat clunky and inaccurate.-The B&N; store they have on the device is convenient, loads content easily, and is very user-friendly to navigate. Once you have your information in, downloads are quick and easy, and you can also set a password for downloads, to prevent someone downloading books without approval. Also, if you have a gift card for B&N;, you can use it to buy books, but you have to go online to your account first, and save the information on your account before it'll charge it, and it'll always charge to that card first before your credit card, which is a pretty cool feature.-The reader itself is awesome, and you can sideload your EPUB files easily onto the device from your computer and start reading them immediately. You can't, however, read PUB files like you can on a regular Nook, which I found obnoxious, since I have a lot of eBooks in that format (that are from a B&N; affiliated website, no less). You also can't put files that HAVEN'T been downloaded directly from the B&N; store on the device over WiFi onto your home screen, so in order to pull up your own personal files sideloaded onto the device (even ones downloaded directly from B&N; online), you have to go into the Bookshelf menu and go from there. Which means that if you don't have WiFi all the time (as I do), very few of your books will be able to be put on your home screen, which is such a childish thing for B&N; to do, really. It takes away the personalization that the tablet could do so well, and bothered the heck out of me when I first discovered it. Granted, you could probably fix it by rooting the device, but you run the risk of other issues in the software when you do that, so hopefully B&N; will come out with an update to fix that annoyance.-The Nook does read PDF files, but it's a very awkward process, since the screen ratio doesn't fit the allotted size, making the text tiny and incomprehensible, so trying to reads books in that format is a headache; zooming in is awkward and clunky, and takes to long to be worth the effort. Also, closing and reopening the file takes you back to the first page, which, if you're attempting to read an extensive document in several sittings, gets really old really fast. If you have book in PDF form, I would suggest downloading something like Calibre and converting them to EPUB to save yourself the trouble.-Music loads and plays easily, though I honestly haven't used that feature much, since I have an iPod, and if I want a playlist, I go from there. Pictures also load easily, though you have to have it in the gallery/grid feature to see previews, otherwise they are just displayed with file type images until you click on them to open. Silly little issue, but again, something B&N; will hopefully fix in the future.Anyway, great product, but really, more potential than actual greatness at this point. I love the fact that I don't have to leave the house to read a book, which is great since I'm at home with an infant all the time. Is it worth the money? If you buy it directly from B&N; online, it's $249, which isn't an awful price for touchscreen reader (it's really only about $100 more than a regular Nook or Kindle), so I would say that yes, it is. It's just still somewhat disappointing that it feels like it's half-finished, but I'm looking forward to see where it all goes from here.",4.0,"Some quirks B&N needs to work out, but otherwise, great reading device",1293408000,"12 27, 2010",Electronics,1.0

Chaika ""book, movie, tech lover""","[16, 20]","I have been down and up with this reader for the past 5 months, but since April, it has been a joy.  B&N; has gotten its act together.  The problem I had with not being able to open books has been solved. B&N; not only finally found out what caused some books to lock up but also how to restore them.  There is no longer any problem with opening any books.When I first bought my reader, the tech support people were not well-trained. They are now.  I have 80 books on it and no problems with any of them.Now, the goodies:  B&N; just introduced Enhanced Editions of some books. These have videos, audio clips, animated maps, etc.embedded in the text.  It's wonderful.  I'm reading D-Day, and throughout there are newsreel segments pertinent to the text.  For instance, you read about Eisenhower and then play the video of him talking to his troops before they embark for the Normandy Coast.  You don't just read about bombing or fighting,you hear and see as well. It's a whole new reading experience and available only on the NOOKcolor (or the iPad with the NOOK app.)Pictures in magazines like National Geographic are gorgeous.  They look better than the print versions. There is a selection of apps for the NOOKcolor, with more coming out all the time.However, if you want all the Android apps, then  you can get an N2A SD card on Amazon that turns your NOOKcolor into a full Android tablet with access to the Market. You then  have the option of booting the reader up as a NOOKcolor or an Android Tablet.  You can even get a Kindle App so you can get and read books from Kindle on your NOOKcolor.Some people say that the backlit screen has glare and that you can't read it outdoors.  Not true.  I read my NOOKcolor in my sunny back yard all the time, and, although I'm a 76 year old lady, I can read for hours on it with no problem.Now for the goodies besides the Enhanced Editions.  You can get an app that allows you to work on Office documents on your reader.  Downloading files, pictures, and music is a breeze.The NOOK also allows you to borrow ebooks from public libraries.  All you need is a library card.  Libraries all over the US are lending ebooks.  So, you don't have to buy all the books you want to read.  That's a big saving. And, it takes less than a minute to download a  book.  You just connect your reader with a USB cord and Adobe Digital Editions displays the books you've borrowed & you drag the ones you want to the My NOOKcolor shelf.  As with Kindle, there is also a Lend Me feature so that your friends can borrow from you.The touch screen is very sensitive and I'm very clumsy, so it took me awhile to be able to navigate easily, rapidly, and without bringing up unwanted menus.  But that was true of the iPhone when I got my first one,Why don't I go all the way  and give this 5 stars?  Because the device doesn't have a ""sync to farthest point read"" feature, so if you decide to look at an earlier page,the only way to get back is to use this awkward slider bar.  I can never get it to stop at just the page I want.  The same is true of clicking on endnotes.  When you're through reading them, you have to navigate backwards to the text. There is a Back button displayed on the Notes page, but it disappears before you can read your note.  B&N; has some work to do on this.In sum, if you buy it at Barnes and Noble, the NOOKcolor is only $249, half the price of the cheapest iPad or even Android Tablets.  Yet, for $39.95 more you can get the card to turn it into a full Android Tablet.  It is incredibly more versatile than the Kindle. Page turning is smoother than on the Kindle--or am I the only one who sees the afterimage of the page you're going from while you're turning pages on the Kindle?  On the NOOKcolor, like the iPad, you just touch and you're  on the next page.One other thing: naturally, a touch screen will get smudged.  B&N; says to wipe it with a dry microfiber cloth.  I found that didn't clean it enough.  If the screen isn't clean, it can get jumpy.  So, knowing that the iPhone has a capacitative touch screen as does the NOOKcolor, I tried using the products sold in the Apple Store to clean the screen.  They work perfectly.As mentioned in my earlier review, I also like the NOOKcolor feature of your being able to share a passage with a friend without leaving the page you're reading.  Also, I find the Web browser is just fine. In fact, when I'm  reading and see a name or word I need more info on, I just touch it and when the popup appears, I choose Wikipedia or Google and surf to my heart's content. Then I just touch the ""book"" icon on the lower screen and I'm back to the page I was reading.  It's smooth and fast.I belong to Goodreads and when I'm through with a book, I can just go to the Goodreads app on my NOOKcolor and post my review immediately.

Customer service offered no remedy other than purchasing a refurbished model for $200, so I opted for the Nook Color (NC). The NC is superior in almost every way.

Either the demo is set up to deceive so everything around it is a perfect environment that real life will hardly ever duplicate, or the demo is set up by a novice and you end up with a garbage demonstration.Either way, as a consumer, if you're reading a review the moment you see something to the effect that the review is based off of a Demo, skip that review as it is close to baseless.I have now had my nookColor for 2 days so this is only an initial review, I'll come back and add to it after the warrant runs out.  As of right now, this is beyond what I could have hoped for in an eReader with features.eBooks:  They download quickly and the controls are very intuitive.  You can set the screen colors and fonts to adjust to your own preferences.  The books are stored in an easy to use library and also backed up by B&N; (if you purchase from them).  As a test I reset my nook after downloading a purchased book (don't worry, I had a copy on my PC's hard drive).  After the reset I re-entered my username and password and my nookColor quickly updated and the book was back where it belonged in the library.  The other feature that I haven't had time to try out is using it to read other types of ebooks.  Very excited to see this as other online stores offer books in other formats that can be cheaper than B&N.;Multimedia/Pandora:  I copied quite a few high resolution photos as well as 2 mp4 movies to a microSD card.  They all displayed amazingly well and the movies played flawlessly.  These were full length movies backed up to an mp4 format using handbrake.  While the movie player is very basic it does the job and makes this a 7-inch movie player on top of being an eReader.  The screen is amazingly clear and the movies flowed smoothly without hic-ups.  The photos were quickly loaded and clearly displayed.  Being able to listen to Pandora with my own customized music while reading was an amazing bonus.WiFi:  It took about 30 seconds for me to completely configure the nookColor to my home network.  It retains all pertinent information and quickly connects even after a full shut down.Web-browser:  While it does not yet have flash player support the vast majority of the internet works just fine.  It is based off of the android system for a cell phone so some pages automatically load as mobile.  When using the browser I was able to log into facebook, my bank account, my hotmail, my att.net mail, gmail and youtube with no problems.  The screens zoom and pan feature is nice so you can zero in on portions of a webpage and more accurately hit links.  Typing on it was a bit tedious for me, but I have never been very comfortable with touch screens so I'm going to chalk that up to my error.Unit:  As some have mentioned this tablet has about twice the weight of the kindle, which means it weighs a bit more than a full length paperback novel.  Unless you have a degenerative bone disease you should be just fine holding this table to read your ebooks.  The battery life isn't anywhere near as long as the kindle but it was more than sufficient for my needs.  The entire design is sleek and I found it conformed well to being held in either landscape or portrait.",5.0,Can't get enough of my NookColor,1291680000,"12 7, 2010",Electronics,1.0

More importantly, I wanted something that would allow me to highlight and take notes on passages. Finally, if the physical copy of a book had pictures in it, I wanted to be able to see those pictures on my E-Reader.WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THE NOOK:--One of the first things to attract me to the Nook was its simplicity. There are only 4 buttons to be seen: A power button, Volume Up, Volume Down and the Nook ""Menu"" button. The buttons are inconspicuous and don't protrude.--I was able to download almost all of the books I was looking for from the B&N; shop. To be fair, some of the stuff I read is relatively obscure.--I like the ability to highlight passages with different colors and take notes.--I like that it shows pictures from books.--Although it wasn't something I was looking for at the start of my E-Reader search, I found that I liked the built-in games (Chess, Sudoku, Crossword puzzles, etc).--Finally, the touchscreen is pretty responsive (not perfect) and the menus are mostly intuitive.A FEW THINGS I DON'T LIKE ABOUT THE NOOK:--As mentioned earlier, the touchscreen is good, but not perfect. It can be really touchy and trying if you're trying to get a certain passage highlighted. Even more difficult is trying to navigate web pages using the browser. I don't recommend the Nook as a Netbook or iPad replacement, but it is nice if all you use it for is downloading more books or reading some online news.--Pictures from physical books sometimes show up on the Nook version of the book. When they do (like maps in fantasy novels) they are usually much, much smaller. Unfortunately all the Nook books I've seen don't allow you to resize or zoom in on these maps or pictures.OVERALL:For the most part, the Nook met my initial requirements. Some things I didn't think I'd use much before (Chess, etc) I actually use fairly often and will come in handy to pass away the time on a long plane flight or layover.If you want something that will just read books, then I'm sure you can find something better. Likewise, despite all the extra feature that the Nook has, it is no threat to the iPad.But for those that are looking for something in-between, the Nook is a handsome, intuitive and reasonably priced alternative.",4.0,KINDLE KILLER?,1303084800,"04 18, 2011",Electronics,1.0

Thankfully, I'm not like most people my age.For a brief moment I wanted to get the iPad because of one reason, I wanted to read magazines. Then I realized that a device the could carry all of my books as well as my stacks of magazines would be a ideal for me. That's where the Kindle and Nook Color came in...Some people think it's a matter of either or when it comes to these two products, but I think we need both on the market. So this is what it comes down to:If you are a serious, die-hard ereader who wants to read for hours on-end without getting tired or outdoors without glare, then the Kindle is the best choice for you. It's eInk looks so incredible you will find it hard to believe it's a tablet and not a real page. And if that wasn't enough the battery can last up to a month!I came VERY close to getting this great product, but then I tried the Nook Color...The Nook Color can only be described in one word, PERFECTION! Some people don't like the weight of it but I actually do, it might be heavier than the Kindle but it's more durable and better to hold this way. To be honest, the Kindle was so lightweight that at times it feels like it will snap in half. The Nook Color's screen is unbelievably beautiful, it's clear, crisp, and simply stunning. Book covers look amazing sitting on the shelf in your library and magazines will blow you away. This is why it beats the iPad on every level; its better for reading ebooks, better for reading magazines, and it's much more portable. As a student my messenger bag is already heavy enough because of all my textbooks, the last thing I need is a bulky, 9 inch, heavy tablet like the iPad. Not too mention it's insane price tag, I can barely afford textbooks so throwing $500 at Steve Jobs is not an option. That's why I decided I'd rather have an ereader under my tree this year instead of an over-sized, glorified iPod Touch (especially when I already have an iPod Touch.) But ereaders like the Nook Color and Kindle are perfect for people like me.The Nook store has every book the Kindle store does, (so far from what I've seen), and they get more ebooks and magazines on a regular basis. And the interactive children's books are great for reading stories to my nephews and niece. Plus the Nook Color designer covers are the perfect addition to you Nook, they can be a bit pricey but they are attractive and well-made, a great investment! And for those of you who think it might be hard/tricky to figure out just hang in there, the set-up vids that play straight away are really helpful and will explain whatever the instruction booklet might have left out.So if you want to read books, look at magazines, listen to your music, read interactive children's books, view your photo albums all in a tablet that's actually the weight and size of a real book then buy the Nook Color! So might have to sacrifice the eink and the long battery life, but trust me it's well worth it, you won't regret getting the Nook Color.",5.0,$250 = eReader PERFECTON!!!,1293753600,"12 31, 2010",Electronics,1.0

E-Ink technology vs. LCD technology, Tablets vs. dedicated E-Book readers...it has been a very hard decision indeed.  I have been lucky enough to have unrestricted access to almost all the abundant choices that are out there, and I have to say that the nook color is the most impressive out of all them.  That being said, I feel that they have only started to scrape the surface of what is possible with this machine.The Nookcolor has a beautiful screen, and after having it only a few days but barely being able to put it down I have to say that the battery life for the Nookcolor (with it's impressive resolution) is impressive.  The color screen is impressive and nice to have, and with the new update that you can download from the Nook's website, it makes the browsing a lot easierA fair amount of people might complain that it's a heavy reader, which it is heavier than most, but for myself - I like the weight of it.  It's reassuring, like that of a new hardcover book, and my eyes have not grown tired over time from reading the screen.The prices for the books?  Well, honestly there really isn't too much that can be done from B&N;'s perspective I guess.  Sometimes they're disappointing for the mere fact that you can sit in the store and read, and then go look at the price of the physical book to discover that it's 3 or 4 dollars cheaper in trade form.  But if that's the case, then the option has presented itself to buy the physical book over the ebook.  (Yes, muting the point of having an ebook reader/tablet but the option is nonetheless present.)The reading for up to an hour is a nice touch on B&N;'s side.  I enjoy going to a bookstore and this gives me a perfect opportunity to go and sit down (of course trying to find a chair can be difficult but has nothing to do with this review) and peruse the online NookBook selection.  And if I grow tired of trying to find something on their exceptionally designed online store, I can simply walk around the store to find a new selection.I am thoroughly impressed with this eBook tablet, it's a near perfect blend of the technology out there, and as I stated before - I feel that Barnes and Noble will only continue to improve their new reader.

I expected an easy, friendly interface with a somewhat underpowered device, after all it is an eReader, not a tablet PC. The UI is very user friendly and I am quite surprised of the power of the nook color. The touch screen is way more responsive than I expected, page turning and scrolling is very smooth.

So to hopefully remedy that, I batch converted the files to 50% and now the scrolling is back to normal. I don't know if this issue can be addressed by B&N; or if this is just a hardware limitation.

The Nook itself was a gift (thank goodness) but I've pored tons of into it in the form of cases, apps, books and magazine subscriptions. Now I am trying to find a place that will give me more than $20 for the parts. A sampling of the problems with the Nook Color.1. The screen is backlit and incredibly bright. Even on the dimmest setting, I am rubbing my eyes within twenty minutes. I can't read this for extended periods without getting a migraine.2. One of the major appeals of an E-book for me was cheaper books, as there are obviously significantly decreased costs of production. Titles on the Nook are extremely expensive. I compared it to Kindle prices, and the Nook's were always noticeably more expensive. The cases are pure highway robbery ($35 for a case in store).3. Customer service. They brag one of the main advantages of Nook over Kindle is the customer service. This is false. The people working the Nook booth in my local B&N; have never been too helpful, and I don't like having to drive 15 minutes to a store to ask a basic question. However, whenever I call, there is a long wait time and I never can communicate well with the person on the other end.4. Deceptive advertising. The Barnes&Noble; ad campaigns heavily feature the fact that the Nook Color and HD can play movies, marketing is an alternative to Kindle Fire. The Kindle can download almost any movie from Amazon Instant and stream anytime and anywhere without taking up much memory. Nook can sometimes load Netflix when you had an excellent Wifi connection. When I do have an excellent Wifi connection (like at home) I am going to watch movies on my TV or laptop, not E-reader. The only times I would want to watch movies on my E-reader are say, on vacation or on a long bus ride... when I do not have an excellent Wifi connection. The feature is deceptive and pointless.5. The final straw for me was the magazine system. I have used only a fraction of my Nook's memory, but to save space, the Nook automatically deletes my old magazine issues. If I want to access them again, I have to re-download them, a slow and pain-staking process. And then, within a day, Nook has deleted them all again. When I asked Nook support about this (if I bought those magazines I should have the right to do with them what I'd like) there was practically no response.THIS IS AMAZON.

Anyway, I was very dissapointed at this iteration of the Nook.First off, the Nookcolor is very heavy.  I think it's almost 1 pound, and since it's not a true tablet, you're supposed to hold it in one hand, but it'll strain your hand muscles after a few minutes.  Even the B&N; guy told me to hold it with TWO hands. That's pretty pathetic, I must say. The only way to use it for more than a few minutes is to pop it up on some support, which obviously is not convenient for a device that's primarily an e-book reader.Second, even though it's much faster than 1st- and 2nd-generation Nooks, it is still slow, especially when browsing the web.  Now, page turns are generally faster, but there is no animation, and sometimes there *is* a slight delay so you're never sure if the device registered your turn gesture.  Very annoying.Third, the screen is high-res but rather poor in contrast and viewing angles.  I think the resolution is 1024x600, and the DPI is in the high 100's, but overall I felt the screen looked coarse.  I guess for this price, they have to pick some cheapo screen, so no surprise there.  The color LCD screen, of course, draws down battery pretty quick, a fact even the B&N; staff acknowledges readily.  Also, the screen is completely unreadable under direct sunlight.Speaking of the screen, the digitizer is not very responsive, whether you want to zoom in or out or type something.  It's slightly better than my 4th-gen iPod touch but that's still a very frustrating experience.Fourth, the software is still buggy.  The demo unit in store had a few books, but half of them could not open, with some mysterious error message.  The web browser could not render several web sites I tried.Fifth, the interface is very confusing.  There is the hard nook button, there is some kind of drawer button on the screen.  After an hour I still found myself tapping the wrong button to do something.  Very dumb.Sixth, of course, you cannot access the Android Marketplace app store, at least without jailbreaking this.  Very few apps are available and there is no indication B&N; will allow more aps, since they wnat to use this sell e-books, which carry fat margins and have super-enriched Amazon and its founder.In short, this is a disappointing device, not the least because its hefty weight and barely useable screen are just ridiculous for an e-book reader.The list price is $249.99 and B&N; does offer a 30-day money back guarantee if you buy it from them.",1.0,"Heavy, slow, poor screen, buggy",1291334400,"12 3, 2010",Electronics,0.0

There have been plenty of books that by their cover (yes i judge) and short summary I would've bought but because of my ability to skim the book in store I have decided not to buy.Similarly there are some great books out there but for photography and coffee table type books, you really can't experience them the same way with a nook or an ipad. All that being said, I decided to support B&N; because their library is just as large as amazons and I throughly enjoy their storefronts.Ok onto the review.Reading on the nook color is easy, the Android interface is fast and reliable, not to mention easy rootable!Reading on the nook vs the nook color is vastly different because of the eink display on the nook. There is a fair amount of eyestrain associated with reading on a backlit display but I had no problems reading for well over 2 hours on it. The font was just as clear and easy to read as on my ipad.Size wise it is not much different than the original nook but is much heavier.It is lighter and easier to carry than the ipad because of its dimensions.In the end I did not buy this product to read on it, I bought it to root and use android honeycomb on it.This makes the this the best value out of any reader on the market in my opinion.The nook has virtually the same specs as the Samsung galaxy tab aside from the 3g.at $250 (buy directly from B&N;) you cannot complain, Honeycomb runs smooth and opens up an entire world of possibilitiesfor this little tablet.",4.0,Nook for an Amazon Lover?!,1300320000,"03 17, 2011",Electronics,1.0

I have personally purchased (and returned to the store) four e-readers prior to this one (and tried many others owned by friends including Kindles and IPads) and the Nook Color is head and shoulders about everything I've tried - and certainly for its price range.  It fits my needs almost perfectly and with some additional tweaks and android apps to come in the future, I trust it will come even closer to perfection.1.  One important advantage is that it does not have e-ink.  I, for one, hate e-ink.  It makes the whole screen flash and takes a long time to get to the next page.  The new Kindle was advertised as having faster page turns but when I tried it at the store it still had the annoying flash and didn't seem measurably faster.  That was one of the deal breakers for me on the various e-readers I've tried.  I read very fast and the e-ink page turns make the experience very annoying.  I get into an escape groove when reading and don't want the whole screen to flash every 30 seconds or so -- it is horribly distracting.  I guess that people who read at a third grade level don't mind the slow page turns on the Kindle.  I've been reading e-books for years on my phones, my Droid and my tablet PC and the page turns are all instantaneous. I have no trouble reading for 8 hours at a stretch on an LCD screen.2.  With Nook, you aren't tied to a single book provider -- I don't understand how people can be so tied to Amazon without complaining.  The Kindle makes it as hard as possible to get books from other sources including leaving out external memory.3.  Perhaps one of the greatest advantages is that the Nook and Nook Color are compatible with Overdrive DRM books downloadable from libraries.  While I buy a lot of books and give major support to the book industry, I would never be able to satisfy my appetite for books at $5-9+ apiece being stuck with Amazon and not being able to get library books -- and I don't mean Guttenberg out-of-copyright books -- I mean real books published in the last few years.  My local library has over 5000 digital e-books that I can `check out' electronically.  Some digital libraries have many more.  I showed an in-law how to access digital libraries and found that the state of Oregon digital library has many more (over 10,000) than my library does .  I do need to download them to my laptop and then drag and drop them to my Nook which is plugged in to the computer through the USB port.  But that is the work of a few minutes.  The books automatically expire and `freeze' after a few weeks (some libraries let you adjust the checkout time from one to three weeks).  So you never have to worry about overdue book fines.  Since the digital library acts just like a regular library, sometimes the book you want is in use by another person.  Then you just put a digital hold on it and they notify you by email when it is available.Barnes and Noble also allows the books you buy from them to be loaned out and you can `borrow' books from other readers.4. The Nook actually does a decent job (but not yet perfect) with PDF files.  From the reviews I've read on Amazon about the Kindle reader -- PDF files are still pretty messy - you have to email them to yourself and/or convert them to epub docs and then it destroys all the formatting (including taking out tables and graphics) - I mean, what's the point?.  With the Nook you can see the article exactly as it is in an academic journal.  Nook Color uses Quickoffice for their PDF and Doc files but there were a few features left out compared to QuickOffice on my Droid.  One was the ability to have a `reading view' where the text automatically wraps to the size of the page.  But by zooming the page on the PDF I can read by moving the article around.  I can actually read the small print when in the original format but that could get tiring after a while.  It also lacks the ability to bookmark the PDF.  However they are planning on making more use of the Android platform and I trust that a future update will include the `reading view' with page wrap and the bookmark function.  But I can live with what they have for now.5.  The Nook Color has external memory which neither Kindle nor IPad have!!  Besides the 8 GB of internal memory (5 GB are available for use) there is a slot cleverly hidden in the corner of the device to add up to 32 additional gigabytes of SD memory.  That is a fantastic advantage for someone who wants to carry around a lot of academic articles and/or have a large choice of books to read while traveling.  You don't have to spend hundreds of dollars to get a memory upgrade like you do with the Ipad. It also means you can carry around the 500 pictures you took on your last vacation!6.  The Nook Color is the perfect size (under one pound and 7 inch screen).  Neither too big nor too small.  The 7 inch screen is bigger than the Kindle and smaller than the Ipad.  It holds about the same amount of text found on a standard paperback page.  Of course, that is completely adjustable and you can increase or decrease the size of the print, the print font, the spacing, the background color for the page, the brightness and the margins.  It is a heavier than the Kindle but only about half the weight of the IPad.  I can hold it and read quite comfortably - lighter than a standard hardcover book.  I put it in a case for a regular Nook and the Color is a little too tall but the upper end is held by elastic bands and they stretch enough to fit.  So it does have the feeling of a book when being held.7.  I haven't even gotten to one of the main advantages that had everyone drooling over the Ipad - it is in color!!  Beautiful, vivid, color.  Thus magazines, PDFs with color and children's books all can be read without sacrificing anything.  The Kindle now has wi fi - but what is the point if you can't see things in color?8.  The Nook does have video and pictures - I moved some pictures over from my camera and discovered that one of them was actually a video and it played perfectly.  While it will play many Youtube videos (all the ones I tried worked) but it doesn't yet have Flash memory so you can't use it for news videos on CNN, for example.  So I will have to experiment with it some more. My photographs look great on my Nook - about the size they would be if they had been printed.  Unlike my Droid, people don't have to squint when you show them pictures and the screen doesn't time out.  It is easy to flip through the pictures with a swipe of the finger.  One of the other e-readers I used had color but you couldn't flip through the pictures, you had to select each one individually.9.  It also plays audio files.  The sound is on the low side so you need a portable speaker or headphones.10.  The battery lasts about 8 hours (which is a lot longer than the battery on my Droid phone if I`m using it for reading).  However, I found that my little portable Sanyo battery works with it and recharges it through the cord that comes with the Nook.  So that can probably stretch out the available power another hour or two for long airplane flights.11.  Of course, as mentioned above, it has WiFi.  The pages load quite quickly and I haven't had any problems.  I've tried it at four different WiFi locations and never had a problem connecting.  Some reviewers complained that it doesn't have 3G and thus there might be a spot or two where you can't download a book.  Guess what - 3 G is not ubiquitous either!  I recently was on a trip with a group of people in a remote location and the people with Kindles had to wait for a place with WiFi before they could download any books!!  And even at that, sometimes they couldn't get the WiFi to work even though I could get it to work on my Android phone (I didn't have my Nook yet).  There are big holes in the 3G network in rural areas in the USA too.12.  The device is an Android system and thus upgradable and theoretically apps can be added.  It doesn't have access to the main Android Market but will have its own market since the operating system was apparently modified.  I guess they also don't want people downloading the Kindle app and Borders app and the Kobo app for Android in the first few weeks (although I discovered that the books I bought on Kobo could be downloaded to my Adobe Digital software and then moved to my Nook).  Since I have a  Droid phone - the lack of access to 100,000 apps on my Nook doesn't really matter).  I want it mainly for an ereader and it does a good job with that.  But it is a plus that I can use it for WiFi access while in odd places without carrying around a laptop.  I am able to view web pages in a decent size which my Droid can't do.13.  It has a few games - Sudoku, Chess, Crosswords - all of which work flawlessly and have endless variations.14.  It has some strange little quirks.  I found that you can't really type on the on-screen keyboard when it is plugged in.  You can read and turn pages but if you try typing the keyboard registers extra letters or duplicates the letter you just hit.  I discovered this when I first got it and tried to register it while it was still charging.  But otherwise the capacitive screen is great and very responsive.  Also I noted when doing the crossword puzzles that the edge of the screen doesn't work as well as the center when putting in letters -- you have to hit it a few times.15, I should mention that I've been using it almost non-stop for a week and have not found any major software or hardware flaws.  Of the 4 previous e-readers I bought and tried out two of them failed completely within the first week and all of them had some major flaw such as freezing up, had to be reset and erased or other problems.  I haven't found a bug yet on the Nook.16.  Has a 'shelf' system for organizing books -- especially useful for books you put on it from other sources.17.  I note that Amazon advertises it for over $300 (one vendor has it for $400!) but you can get it for $250 everywhere else including Best Buy and Barnes and Noble.  I guess Amazon doesn't want anyone to buy it through them and compete with the Kindle.",5.0,Great ereader,1290988800,"11 29, 2010",Electronics,1.0

It worked absolutely perfectly and there no problems whatsoever.  Then, in September or so, it started shutting itself off without any provocation especially when I was on the internet. After it happened a few times, I took it to one of the local B & N bookstores and a Nook salesperson gave it a software upgrade. Everything was fine for about 2 days and then it happened again and got even worse.  I took it back to the store and was told by a different Nook person that there was nothing he could do because the problem wasn't presenting itself right then and there which really ticked me off.I called tech support and the person there was helpful and had me do something called a &#34;factory re-set&#34; which basically set the device back to what it was when I first got it except all the reading material I had purchased was still there and just needed to be downloaded. For 2 weeks, the Nook went back to working great  but then it started happening AGAIN and I started e-mailing tech support. We went back and forth for a while (they recommended doing the factory re-set again) but basically there was nothing else to be done and this problem didn't happen too often. I was told I could purchase a certified pre-used Nook but I have been unemployed since July and I can't afford anything like that.I was in a  different B&N; bookstore last week and mentioned it to one of the Nook people there and she confided that the old ones were programmed by Barnes and Noble while the brand new (and of course more expensive) Nook HD's were programmed by Microsoft and probably worked better and lasted longer. It's a shame because this was given to me as a gift and was not a cheap thing to purchase and I think it's awful that it didn't even last 2 years.

I'd say that if you want a lot of FREE ebooks(from borders, project gutenberg, b&n;, googlebooks, etc*), the internet browsing capability is a must, especially since, unlike the kindle, this baby supports the ultra-standard .epub file format, meaning you can download any book you find on the internet straight onto this ereader without doing any messy file transfers or conversions or whatever. (The only thing is that you can't move these downloads into your official library, but this doesn't really bother me because all I hear chirping in my ear is the word FREE.)Usually I can carry this around instead of a laptop  because it's much lighter and has the basic functions that I need for entertainment, including music.I haven't had any trouble with battery life. I generally read with WiFi on (so I can stream music with headphones in), volume at a medium setting, and brightness at it's lowest. I haven't been keeping track meticulously but since I haven't been able to get off the thing since I first got it, and have only needed to charge it once (the first time), I definitely get more than 8 hours at those settings. I don't know if this matters, but for the first charge, I left it in for the recommended three hours even though the light indicated it was done charging after two hours.I still really like the iPad (yay apps! and shiny screen), but it is definitely heavier, too powerful for my needs sometimes (i.e. basic internet/reading), more expensive, and has more glare (although this can be solved and I have just been too lazy). Also, apple only gives you built-in memory, whereas this thing lets you add a microSD card. I don't own a Kindle 3, but I think the internet browsing and sound functions are such a big part of what I do that I think I would not prefer the Kindle.Also, apparently you need to have a light touch when using touchscreens. It took me a while to realize, but monster fingers don't work.Overall, the only thing I wish this had was more apps.

I have been wanting an I-Pad for scrolling the internet, checking e-mails, etc, but it seemed very bulky, heavy and I was not going to spend $600.  So I saw the Nook Color in Best Buy and felt it wasn't really that heavy.  It is about the size and weight of a paperback.  It's also about 1/2 the price of an I-Pad so I did some research and found out that one can scroll the internet, check e-mails, play music (but I have an I-Pod so I won't really be using that feature), read books and magazines.  Here are some of the features that I like best:{1} Books-Books are very easy to read on the Nook Color.  You can make the font larger or smaller, reduce the backlight (which helps to conserve the battery) You can also highlight the text (and ""highlight a highlight"" which makes the highlight darker as if you were highlighting on a paperback book). You can also share certain passages with friends via Facebook (but you must be within Wi-Fi to use this feature).You can also look up words with the built-in dictionary and makes notes in the text.{2} Magazines-Magazines on the Nook Color look just like they do on the newsstand. The magazines are complete with all the ""ads"" and articles. You can also use ""article view"" in which you can select the article you want to read instead of reading the whole magazine.  Most magazines start with a free 14-day trial and then you are billed monthly until you cancel the subscription.  Canceling subscriptions is not that hard to do.{3} Library- You can customize your Library to look the way you want it to.  You can have shelves with all your classic books together, all your magazines together, your romance books together, your comedy books together and so on.{4} Lend Me- Lend me is like a ""Book Swap"".  If you have friends or relatives that have a Nook Color you can ""lend"" each other books.  You start off by requesting a book to ""borrow"".  When they approve the ""borrow"" the book will appear in your Library for a period of say 14 days. After the ""borrowing time"" is up the book is automatically returned to the library of the person who lent it out.{5} Nook Friends- Nook friends is like your little book club.  You can lend books and suggest books to each other.  If no one has a Nook Color that you know you can also go online and find some friends.{6} Applications- The Nook Color also has certain applications that you can download.  You can get games (like ANGRY BIRDS-my personal favorite, MahJong, Solitaire & Tangrams),Epicurious, apps to organize yourself, and many others.  The selection is very limited but they will add more in the future.{7} Personalization- You can personalize your Nook Color to look unique. You can set a personal photograph to be the background when you turn on your Nook.{8} Purchasing Books- Books are very reasonable priced for the NC.  There are books as cheap as $5 and even FREE.  They are adding new free books every week. You can also read any e-book up to an hour for free at any Barnes & Noble store. The Barnes and Noble cafe (i.e. Starbucks) will also send offers to you via your NC (although I haven't receieved any as of yet). Once you purchase books downloading is actually very fast. I actually downloaded three books in a matter of six minutes.  They also recommend books based on ones that you already own.  The books you purchase are yours forever, so if you purchase another NC you will have the books you have now,  you can also read your library on your PC, your smartphone (by downloading the ""Nook App""){9}Battery Life- My battery has lasted about four days if I'm just reading.  But when you play games it will probably last about two days.  The charger has an ""n"" on it that stays orange when it is charging and once the battery is charged it turns green.  It was about half charged out the box.  You can use the NC while charging but the screen is very sensitive.  If the battery is completely drained it takes about three hours to completely charge.{10} Virtual Bookmark- You used to have mark the page you were last reading yourself.  But not with the NC.  It has a ""virtual"" bookmark.  So when you start reading a book,then you have to put the NC down or turn it off for the night it will ""save"" your place automatically.  Then when you want to resume reading you can start back at the point you were before you turned off the NC.  You can start reading by touching the ""book"" icon on the NC (bottom left-it looks like an open book) from anywhere.  So if you are reading a magazine, and want to read the last book you were reading just tap the book icon and your book is opened to the point where you left off.  You can also choose any book in your library and it will open them where you left off.{11}Home Screen - You can personalize the home screen to look any way you like. You can upload pictures or use the ones pre-set to use your background.  So two NC's can never look alike.  You can make your NC as unique as you are.There are other features as well.  So in conclusion, the NC is a very good tablet for about half the price of the I-Pad. But I do recommend getting a cover for it since it will get smeared or scratched if you don't. If I need to take a break my very hectic life I just grab my Nook Color and my I-Pod,put on some very relaxing music and I am instantly transported into my own imaginary world. This is perfect for long car trips. This is one of the best ""me"" gifts in a long time.  Now my husband wants one of his very own.",5.0,Awesome Little Device,1306886400,"06 1, 2011",Electronics,1.0

I own 2 Kindle IIs (actually only one left now as I ran over one with my car), the Kindle Touch (my favorite), the iRiver HD reader, an iPad, various Android phones, an iPhone and other gadgets. I had great hopes for the Nook Color as I like to read comics like Dilbert etc which lose much of their appeal on the black and white Kindles. But after experience with Kindles, I was shocked (shocked I tell you!) at the short battery life of the Nook Color.One of the first things you learn with a Kindle is to turn off the wireless when you are not downloading new material. It then seems like the battery lasts forever.Not so with the Nook Color. The downloading is not as straightforward as with the Kindle, but after one or 2 tries you get the hang of it. Once you are used to it, the download of material works alright and is simple enough to use.Immediately after getting my Nook Color, I bought and downloaded a pile of color Dilbert books. I was delighted with the resolution and color.But as you may have picked up on by now, the battery life is ridiculously short. Their claims of 8 hours reading time is wildly optimistic.But that is hardly the worst. Even if you turn off the wireless and DO NOT USE IT AT ALL, the battery is gone is less than a week. Rather infuriating to pick up your Nook Color to read a few comics only to find the battery is dead once again. It does charge up faster than my Kindles - about 3-4 hours. I've had it now about 6 months. Don't use it to read anything other than color comics though as it is much heavier than my Kindle Touch.I have researched many titles and have not found BN to have better pricing for any book so far. If you read the occasional classic like Twain, Dickens or Dostoevsky, there is no comparison. Amazon wins hands down with selection and price. I was drawn to the Nook for its color and claims of better access to comics.But with a battery that goes dead quite quickly, even when you are not using it, I cannot recommend it, even to readers of comics.Can't say that I have used it for videos etc. Wouldn't want to take the risk knowing what I know of its battery!! Who wants to get cut off only a few minutes into a streaming video?I have a friend who bought the Kindle Fire on my recommendation. He gets a good laugh at my stories of frustration with the Nook Color.I have checked with a few user groups thinking I perhaps got a lemon. The poor battery life is a common complaint though.Working with BN is nothing like the great experiences I have had with Amazon over the years both for the Kindle and all other customer service issues.Perhaps the new Nook Tablets have solved the battery problem, but I won't be taking that chance again.I'll stick with Kindle and add the new Fire as soon as my budget allows.Now that I've read this over I better include a disclaimer: I am not associated with Amazon in anyway except as satisfied customer.

Although it's a bit weird to be writing a review of it on Amazon, I felt that potential Kindle purchasers should understand their options.The Nook Color is, by far, the best eReader I've used (including the iPad). It's not perfect, but it almost is. The LCD screen is very easy to read, which surprised me since I was a big fan of e-ink and did not like long-term reading on the iPad. The lack of need for a night light is great, and the software it ships with is lightning fast and almost bug-free. Really, there is no lag when I'm using it and the functionality (once you spend 3 minutes learning it) is near-perfect.BN is quickly catching up to Amazon on content...frankly don't notice a difference anymore. Plus, you can side-load eBooks from Google and elsewhere.I know this...I will never go back to e-ink again and love this screen.I also LOVE the delivery of magazines on this thing. Really, it's better than the real magazine. You get full color reproduction of text and pics, and it gives you an Article View if you just want to read the article. It is a great way to get magazines and will be better as they get more publishers (right now, it's a decent list but it could be better).I also really like the multimedia support...I can load photos and pics on an Micro SD card and take my music with me. If I'm in a wifi area, I get full Pandora support! I wish it had 3G, but this is still great.Having said that, the Color is not perfect. First off, the weight, while acceptable, is SLIGHTLY too much. It won't cause strain like the iPad and is perfectly capable of being read in bed (you can lock out the gyro so the book doesn't flip Portrait=>Landscape), but it's not the unnoticeable weight of the Nook or Kindle (or paperback). Still way better than a hardcover though.Second, the screen, while great, is slightly tactile, not glass like you would be used to on an iPhone or high-end Android phone...this is nitpicky, but I noticed it.Third, no Flash support yet (and, while it is a great web-browser, it's not a laptop, iPad, or even like my HTC Evo). This, and the lack of pinch-zoom multi-touch, affects my enjoyment of the web brower (note: you can zoom, just not pinch-zoom). UPDATE: Pinch Zoom is here! It's very good, but not great, implementation. Makes the browser that much better!Fourth, the newspaper delivery, while acceptable and similar to the original Nook/Kindle, is not good enough. Frankly, it's easier to read the web pages of the papers than on this and pales in comparison to the magazine delivery, which really is SUPERB!Finally, and most importantly, is the battery. This is not like an e0ink reader. To give you an idea, the other day, I started out with a full charge and I read around 600 pages of a book and did some light browsing. I did not use music or Pandora and did not pay any games. At the end of the day, I had to charge it again. This was about 7 or 8 hours of use. That's OK with me but it ain't the type of thing that you can go on a three day road trip without your chord like the Kindle or original Nook.Anyway, it looks like my cons are longer than the pros, but really, this is a great product. I can't wait to see Amazon's response and appreciate the (hopefully) friendly competition that this represents!",5.0,Wow - what an eReader is meant to be!,1293667200,"12 30, 2010",Electronics,1.0

I also resisted getting an e-reader for years.  I like to turn pages when I read.  However, I played around with this e-reader at the Barnes & Noble counter and was instantaneously and totally hooked.  It is an absolute pleasure to use.  The images on the screen are clear and crisp and the adjustable font makes it easy on anyone's eyes.  The color is glorious.  I liked the social connect to Facebook and found web surfing no problem at all.  The one drawback is that the Nook Color doesn't come with 3-G yet so if you're not at a Wi-Fi hotspot surfing will have to wait until you find one.Setup was very easy; the directions are all on screen.  You have to charge it up before you start using it and this will take about three hours.  After charging it up you have to register your Nook Color before you can begin using it, and if you don't have Wi-Fi at home you'll have to take it to a Barnes & Noble or any other hotspot to complete the process.  Once that's done, you're off and running and can start downloading books, magazines, or whatever.The magazine selection is somewhat limited at this point although I understand more will become available.  But as far as books are concerned, the sky's the limit.  I was able to download books I never thought would be available.  And the prices are unbelievable.  The complete Jane Austen (all six books plus some extras) is available for 99 cents.

The color nook is an excellent reading machine, much better than either the Kindle or the e-ink B&W nook. Using the color Nook is totally intuitive with only a few positive surprises at some unexpected capabilities. The battery life is around 8 hours, so you will need to have your special recharging cord, which comecolor s with the Nook, handy. There are small imperfections in the Nook operating system that will get corrected as Barnes and Noble releases updates. The same was true with the Kindle and B&W Nook when first released. The key to a good reading experience with the color Nook is to turn the brightness down, way down. That way eye fatigue is minimal, similar to the e-ink B&W readers with similar brightness. Even with the brightness down, the contrast is excellent and the letters clear. When browsing the web, you might want to turn the brightness up a bit to beautifully display all those colors. The web browser is excellent. It works for email, especially Google mail.  The trick with the power limitations is to keep the brightness down when using the Nook as a reader and turn the internet off. Only turn the internet on when browsing or shopping. That way, when you put it down at night, the power level will be the same in the morning as it was when you went to sleep. Costing only $249 (Dec 2010) at Barnes and Noble, it's affordable and useful, especially if you travel.  The minus 1 star is for the few little glitches in the 1.0 operating system (based on Android 2.2), for the 8 hour battery life, and for the current lack of Apps. For what it is supposed to do, it does it well; it's better than an i-Pad (smaller, lighter, and far less costly).

I can buy a LOT of paper books and magazines for $300.First, let me say that this is a great concept and the color is FANTASTIC.  Why buy an ereader in B&W;?  Especially if you want to read magazines.It was VERY easy to use - even my grampa could figure it out.  The page turns are quick, clean and the device responds like a dream.  Just what I wanted!So why did I return it to the store?  THERE IS NO 3G on the Nook Color.  Had I known that, I wouldn't have wasted my time but every single review I read said ""3G + WiFi"".  Nope.  And the salesman ASSURED me it has 3G.  Nope.  It only comes with WiFi.  No hot spot?  You can't set the thing up.  And if you can't set it up, you can't even read the manual.While I was impressed with it at the store, I am bitterly disappointed that it was mis-represented as 3G when it is NOT.  What's the point of having this fantastic thing when it won't work where I live?  I'd have to drive all the way into town to find WiFi and if I'm there I might as well just go to the used book store anyway!The touch screen is easy to use and the navigation in the store seemed intuitive and simple.  I really looked forward to using this and I can't.My computer is so old that it can't/won't ""see"" the device and there is no way to tell it the Nook is there (it doesn't come with any software, either).If you live in a larger city where you can get WiFi hotspots all over, then this would probably be a nice thing to have.  But living in the hills with no WiFi and an old computer makes the Nook Color absolutely useless to me.Update:  The B&N; online store only takes credit cards.

Santa was kind enough to leave it under my tree and I've been loving it ever since.Here's why:-The weight of the reader is perfect and the size of the reader and the screen are proportionate to each other.-I love being able to read magazines on my NookColor for the fraction of the cost- in COLOR.-I love that my 19 month old daughter can interact with her favorite children's books both at home and on the go- in COLOR.-IMO there is no need for 3g- it serves no purpose. Once you download your media via the internet/wifi, it's there for you to access wherever you are. NookColor gets two thumbs up for this!-Being able to highlight passages, words etc and come back to them is a fantastic feature as is the ability to look up a words definition via wifi.-NookColor is user friendly and has a great interface; the screen color is clean, clear and crisp.Facebook has a NookColor page where you can go and find other NookColor users who are willing to lend you books and are interested in being lent books, so there's no need to literally know a fellow Nook owner.ALSO- someone mentioned you CANNOT use a Barnes and Noble Gift Card to purchase eBooks- THIS IS INCORRECT. All you have to do is log on to B&N.com; and add your gift card to your account. Once you do that, whatever purchases you make on your NookColor, the price comes off the GC until it is empty and then your CC is charged. Very simple.All in all, this is a great e-reader. The price is right for all of the amazing features it offers and the available accessories make it easy to customize your Nook!",5.0,Best of the best!

BN literally buries the Android OS under a very thick custom UI and turns off many Android features.  This thick customized layer is what make the NC a great eReader, but a not so great a tablet. So while it is locked down, it does what its meant to do very well.One CAN get to non-BN eBooks in either the ePub or Adobe PDF format. Either format works, looks, and reads very well, easily as good as the best the market has to offer in terms of an eBook reading app.  The fact that BN chooses to bury the location of the downloaded non-BN content AND prevents one from creating shortcuts to either the book file or folder, placing said free books on the book shelf, or even listing them in your list of books is an annoyance to the tolerant and tech savvy.  To non-techies and those less tolerant of mucking about with a gadget, e.g., Grandma, it'd be a showstopper.  But then again, would such a user even KNOW how to get to free eBooks?Movies, again well-hidden in the file system, look great, but BN has capped the max resolution below the abilities of the screen AND the stock player is finicky about format.  For instance, my ripped for iPod Touch movies play fine.  My ripped for Droid Incredible movies aren't playable.  This despite both are MV4 files with AAC soundtracks.  The latter are higher resolution and bit rate so that's the issue.  Again, annoying, but not a real problem.The web browser is just fine.  Pretty much a stock Android browser so fast enough, compatible enough messing around, but if I were going to really do some research, I'd use my computer.With Android 2.2 coming in January, and a BN 'approved' Android market, it'll be an amazingly capable tablet for the money.And that is what one has to remember, it's an exceptional value given the hardware (fast processor/GPU combination, GREAT IPS LCD screen with better color/resolution then an iPad), 512MB RAM, expandable storage, great build quality), and has the best eReader app bar none.  Once Android 2.2 is added with some access to at least a few other apps like email, better browser, and a more format flexible music/video player the value will be simply unassailable...at the price.Pros:Great screen - overall looks, color quality, text quality, adjustabilityeReader UIMagazine format is excellentNewspaper and magazine subscriptions are month to monthBuild qualityIndustrial design - it actually sit flat on a table unlike the iWobleMicroSD supportForm factor - fits MANY of the now discontinued or about to be discontinued Amazon Kindle 2 cases!Battery life (for such a lightweight LCD based device in its size range)Full Android experience just a hack awayUnderlying processor/GPU/RAM is quite powerful though not tops, but more then capable of moving to Android 2.2 and possibly even GingerbreadCan read library eBooks if your local library carries themCons:THICK BN UI if you really want the tablet partsUI takes a few minutes to learnBluetooth not enabled (though it may be Bluetooth ready)No microphone (and therefore no Skype down the road unless the headphone jack can be used like early generation iPod Touches)Will need to hack if the BN Nook Market does not have what you want in terms of appsBN prices their books too highBN magazine subscriptions can be high, though some are a good valueNo camerasRecommended to the magazine/newspaper reader especially.

You can only use the charger that's specifically made for the NookColor.  The original Nook (black and white) charging cable won't work.  This wasn't a huge deal for me until I bought a portable charger.  I'm travelling more now and wanted to be able to charge my cell phone, MP3 player, and, of course, my NookColor.  Alas, my new portable charger works for everything except my NookColor even though I'm using the correct NookColor charging cable.  According to B&N; NookColor support, you cannot charge the NookColor via USB-to-computer connection even if you're using the correct cable.  In addition to the specific cable, you must also plug it into the wall.Now, don't get me wrong.  I still have no desire to replace my NookColor.  I never leave home without it for any reason.

Peplinski,"[383, 393]","Last year my husband asked me if I wanted a Kindle, because I love to read all the time and I try to be eco-friendly when possible.  I was intrigued, but my biggest weakness is magazines and I didn't like the availability or look of them on the Kindle.  When the iPad came out, I was blown away by the beauty of it, but felt like for a few dollars more I could just get a whole new laptop and it would be almost the same size.  For travel, the iPad seemed to big and fragile for me; I need to be able to jam all my toys into my backpack and not worry about them.When I stumbled onto the Nook Color, I absolutely flipped my wig and couldn't wait to get one!  Full color magazines, that look just like they do on the newsstand!  This could single-handedly save the rain forests - I seriously buy a LOT of magazines.  I also save them forever because you never know when you might want that one article or photo again, which drives my husband crazy.  So perhaps the Nook Color can save my marriage as well!  That's a lot of expectation to put on this adorable little device, but I think it's up to the challenge.Santa decided to come early to our house, so I just started playing with the NC a few days ago, and it is my first e-reader.  It was almost fully charged right out of the box, so I was able to start playing with it in less than an hour (it says you can use it while it is plugged in, but they keypad is VERY oversensitive when plugged in so I don't recommend it).  It easily connected to my home wifi and linked to the Barnes & Noble account I had set up earlier that day.  If you don't have home wifi, you might have to visit a public wifi location in order to activate it.  I recommend setting up a B&N; account beforehand if you intend to purchase anything from there, as it makes the first-time Nook use very smooth and enjoyable.BOOKS: There are many many books available from a variety of online sources, check the product details for formats (please note it does NOT support Kindle format).  I understand it's also easy to download books from your local public library, though I haven't tried that yet.  The B&N; Shop function within the Nook itself is the easiest interface but certainly not the only option.  While reading, it's very easy to adjust the font, screen brightness, and more to make it as comfortable as possible on the eyes.  At night I turn the brightness all the way down and find it very comfortable for my eyes while reading in bed.  I've read for hours on end without any sort of headache.  I haven't used the highlight, look-up, or share functions very much yet, but they're super easy to incorporate if you enjoy that sort of thing.  Page turning is an intuitive flip of the finger, or you can tap the side of the screen to move forward or back.CHILDREN'S BOOKS: The color on these looks amazing, and the ""read to me"" feature is wonderful for little ones learning to read on their own.  I imagine this would be great fun for a kid stuck in the back seat of a car for a long trip too!  There aren't a ton of Read to Me books available yet but they are adding more every week.  I don't even have kids but these are pretty awesome.MAGAZINES: Obviously this was a major feature for me!  The appearance of the magazines is absolutely gorgeous, the text and photos are clear and sharp.  You can use the ""finger pinch"" method on the touchscreen to zoom in and out, or you can use the ""Article View"" feature to pull out just the text of each page at a pleasant reading size.  The magazine includes every single page that you'd find on the newsstand, including advertisements, which to me is a benefit because I sometimes enjoy the photography and trends those provide.  Magazines can be read in portrait or landscape format, and you can flip through thumbnails at the bottom of the page to reach a particular article.  Most of the currently available magazines offer a single-issue purchase or a 14-day free trial, then bill you monthly for as long as you want to receive issues.  Subscriptions are very easy to manage so canceling is not complicated.  So far there are about 80 magazines available, and the number seems to be increasing regularly.NEWSPAPERS and PDF's: I haven't tried these yet, though some have reported formatting that make certain ones difficult to read.  The ones purchased directly through the Nook store are more likely to be formatted appropriately for the device and easier to read.  Better PDF support is likely to come in a future firmware update, though a lot of it depends on how the original publisher sets up the file.INTERNET: You do need a wifi connection to go online; 3G is unlikely to be available for the Nook Color unless you also purchase an accompanying data plan.  So far most web pages look crisp and beautiful, but are not as fully functional as on a laptop or computer.  Flash functionality is not available yet (but is planned) and a lot of people are experiencing difficulty with email and other text box typing.  I believe this will be fixed very soon, but for now the web is more of a ""read-only"" experience.MUSIC: You can load your own music or use the included Pandora app to link to your Pandora account.  The speaker isn't great so headphones would come in handy.  I'm extremely in love with my new iPod Nano so I will probably strap that on while reading rather than use this feature.VIDEO: Our first try produced some choppy playback, but I think the processor was very busy setting up the hardware because we had just gotten it out of the box.  After that, it played everything perfectly with jaw-dropping video quality!  It will play videos in MP4 format, so get yourself a converter and a microSD card and load it up for your next trip!  Apparently videos can also be side-loaded through the mini-USB cord.  I've only tried it on the card; it reads directly from the card with no problems.OTHER: You can add your own photos to use as background, or just to show friends.  It comes pre-loaded with a few games (sudoku, crossword, and chess) which work well and are fun.  ""Lend Me"" is an exclusive feature that allows you to swap books with other Nook users, and you can find groups of folks online who will swap with you if none of your friends have a Nook.  It uses the android operating system, and an app store is scheduled to open sometime in early 2011 so there will be much much more available in the coming months.I'm the type of person who doesn't need my phone to be a camera, my iPod to be a dvd player, or my e-reader to be a laptop.  The Nook Color does a WONDERFUL job as an e-reader of not only books, but also magazines and newspapers, and it has some other fun bells and whistles.  It does what it's supposed to do very well and the additional features make it a great value for the price.

This isn't an e-ink screen, if that is what you are looking for, go with (a) the original nook, (b) the kindle, or (c) any of the other e-ink dedicated e-readers on the market.This iteration of the nook is marketed towards certain select categories of readers:-The Magazine reader-Students with text books that have graphics-Childrens' books with lots of pictures-Comic book readersIf you notice, these are categories of readers that benefit from the ability of the reader to handle color graphics, which is something e-ink can't yet do!PRICEFor the price, you are getting an android tablet with limited functionality, though, with some technical knowledge, it is possible to unlock this device to be able to fully take advantage of the android market (though it may void your warranty, so do it at your own risk).  Similarly sized android tablets go for prices starting at double the price of the nook color, but they come with full functionality.  Another device this has been compared to is the iPad- which runs at about twice the price as well for the very base model.  On the price point, you are definitely getting a decent deal, though, you are sacrificing some of the functionality for the the reduced cost.Also note, you are not getting 3G access or any other cellular service to access the market- unlike the original nook, that came with the free mobile access to be able to make purchases from the nook market on the go.  The likely reason for the lack of mobile access is due to the fact that this device runs a lot faster and features a full web browser- this increases the speed and easy of the user to access web content- which would be undesirable to any phone service that hosts access because it would reduce the service that their paying customers get.  Instead of mobile data service, users have the option of accessing the BN market and the full internet through wireless.  With today's cell phone technology, many phones are able to be set up as wireless hotspots that users can use to get access on the go- when they are away from their home network.  Overall, this isn't a big deal to me, but I am sure some original nook users depend on that free mobile service to get access to the BN market, so this would be a draw back for you for sure.WEIGHTHonestly, this device does run a little on the heavy side, however, I do believe that it is slightly lighter than it's predecessor.  Still, for the e-reader market, it is heavy.  For the tablet market, it is a little more reasonable.  The weight is a sacrifice, but as long as you aren't trying to read while laying on your back, you should be ok.USER FRIENDLINESS AND EXTRA FEATURESI find this device to be quite simple almost immediately.  Every function that I have looked for has been where I expect it to be and everything has worked smoothly for me.  The page controls while you read work great, and I love that they now give you the option to tap to turn the page rather than having to swipe like you did with the last version of the nook.The full web is pretty easy to use once you get used to typing on a touch screen keyboard (which is always annoying).This device also integrates with your facebook, twitter, and google accounts.  This is great for the avid readers that want to be plugged into their social media.Another feature that is nice to have on the reader is Pandora- it is a nice added bonus to have internet radio available on the reader.One thing I wish this device had was access to android market, but I guess you can't have everything.OVERALLI like this tablet.  I think it was a good buy and I would buy another one if this one broke.  For the price, you are getting an underpowered tablet, but it still has access to the full internet- which you can use multiple windows in.  It is primarily a reader, which makes me wish it were as easy on the eyes as e-ink, but for the market it is being geared towards, you can't really complain about that!",4.0,Excellent value for what it is- a reader with an LCD,1298246400,"02 21, 2011",Electronics,1.0

As I was hoping for a laptop, I was a bit disappointed. :P However, when I actually began using it, I liked it.  The screen changes brightness pretty well, it works pretty fast, and overall I was pretty satisfied.  The only problems I had was that the internet browser is sketchy. By this I mean that at times it just locks up and will not take you to a website. To be honest, I was not able to get one book to download from the Nook itself, but had to convert via my computer. Whatever, I didn't get this to browse the web.  I also didn't like the fact that you can only ""Archive"" books, not delete them (without going into files which have obscure names anyways).  In addition, the battery life is terrible in comparison with others on the market. Yes, I realize that it is due to a color screen (and, no, turning off the wi-fi does not totally fix the battery life issue).I was satisfied with my Nook that is until it broke. The power cord has always been difficult to insert and sometimes took some jiggling to get it to work. However, one day when the little ""n"" lit up, my nook turned off without turning back on. :( I called B&N; right away to get this fixed. They shipped me a replacement and all was gravy until I received a Nook whose cord did not work at all. Since they'd made me ship my old one, I could not pilfer the cord. So I called once more. And once more I was left waiting until the replacement showed up. It did not. Instead I received the USB wall charger...So I called them again. And they again apologized for the inconvenience. I was promised the cord next day due to their mix up. Next day, I called because I had not received the e-mail to say it'd shipped. After being put on hold for more than 10 minutes I was told the cord was back ordered and there was no time frame for when I'd receive it.  To date, I have been without my NookColor for 1 whole month. And customer service has done nothing short of apologize and put me on hold for ridiculous amounts of time.The Nook is good when it works, but should it malfunction, I'd recommend another item since the customer service is a joke.  Three of my friends have the Kindle and are satisfied with it. Another has a Sony e-reader and swears by it. (He's had it for more than 2 years without a problem). Or there is also the choice of buying a iTouch  or using a MAC/PC and using the free app. They work just as well and are much cheaper.",2.0,CNet got this wrong,1313107200,"08 12, 2011",Electronics,0.0

I bought my nook color in an attempt to make part of my extensive library portable when I was riding the bus and I fell in love with it. The responsive, bright screen, the endless customization, the ability to have some android apps to help when I just cant read anymore all quickly helped make my nook one of my favorite electronics. One charge seems to last forever even with heavy usage.  I've kept it in a purple cover I got from B&N and after approx. a year, the nook looks brand new. (Although I would stay away from their purple fabric cover, beautiful but gets dirty SO easily) I absolutely love  my nook color. There are a few minor glitches, it has a tendency to be a little unresponsive if you have too much on it and the web browser isn't so great. The only major problem I've had with it is the fact that the ability to hi-light is unpredictable and difficult. That is why I'm selling mine to upgrade to an Ipad. I recently started taking courses and need something I can underline/hi-light/take notes on, and while the Nook Color is an EXTRAORDINARY e-reader, it was not created for either of those purposes. If what you are looking for is a color e-reader that is comfortable in the hand, with a bright screen and will use it primarily for *reading* then this is a great investment!",5.0,My First E-Reader & I'm Hooked,1331164800,"03 8, 2012",Electronics,1.0

On paper, I consider it the best 7"" tablet for the price. A wonderful display, quick and responsive, micro SD slot...up to 32 gig and 16 gig on board with an Android OS and only $250! Now, the reality, at least according to me. I was very happy with the screen quality and the responsiveness of the unit. 16gig of on board memory...ha! 15gig of that memory is reserved for ONLY material purchased from Barnes and Nobel. You only have 1 gig to install your own media. That's about 200 mp3s or about 45min of mp4 video. That's right! Even though you bought 16gig of data space, Barnes and Nobel is holding 15gig of it for ransom! Now for the micro SD slot. The Nook manual says it supports class 6. I tried a 16gig class 10 and a 32gig class 4 card and had video playback problems with both cards (less with the class 4). I also had some mp3 playback problems with the class 4 card. The Nook had occasional problems even identifying the class 4 card. I have yet to track down a class 6 card at a local vendor. I have no conclusion on this matter, though there are possibilities. There is no flexibility, a class 6 card is the only option (good luck finding a 32gig class 6 card...I am aware that a class 10 card should be compatible, just function as a class 6 card...that's just the tech side of me talking, I know it doesn't always work that way). It is also possible that the micro SD slot is just crappy and there'll be problems with any card. As for the Android OS...not really. This ia a Barnes and Nobel custom version of Android. That means that ONLY apps found on the Barnes and Nobel site are available. The Nook will block apps from any other source. All preloaded apps cannot be deleted. Look over the apps on the Barnes and Nobel site to see if you're satisfied with the choices, I wasn't. That's about it.",2.0,The Nook Tablet,1322611200,"11 30, 2011",Electronics,0.0

The internet browser is great, but there is no flash support (not for the ipad either though) and there are few apps. That is not important to me as I'm using this as an eReader and occasionally play the included games on it when I'm bored (sodoku, crossword, chess). I like that you can play music and listen to it in the background.

If these updates had come a month earlier I may never have purchased the Xoom, but with that said, and now that I have both, their are differences that I'm glad to own both.Nook Color for the value:emailgamesadobe flash (you tube and much more)musicreading (books and magazines with brilliant color) prefer the Nook for reading bookssurfing the internetsize (easy to hold)and for women it fits in my handbagVersus...Motorola Xoom:emailgamesadobe flash (you tube and much more)sharper picture when viewing movies/videosmusicreading (from kindle and nook downloads to the Xoom with their apps)surfing the internetsize (being larger for a better viewing experience) it won't fit in my handbag (but that's mine)quality is amazingmuch more....There are many many things similar to the Nook versus Xoom or Ipad but the value of the Nook Color over the others isthe best and for your average user who just wants to surf the net, view videos, read your email, listen to music andplay (at the moment limited games) and to read books (size for holding to read is perfect) the Nook Color is the BEST valueand it won't disappoint.1st review:Received my NookColor for Christmas and waited until now to write my review.  I wanted to make sure what I write will help others.  Take this device for what it is....a e-reader and not a tablet.  I love it for reading ebooks and emagazines.  A perfect size for books and just a little too small for magazines but if you have patience you can make any page larger just by pinching your fingers open.The color of photos are amazing and beautiful.  I can view just about any website, but not videos from flash.  Again this is not a tablet. But I can view many Youtube videos.  I have downloaded my own photos and they look great.I cannot open my emails from my carrier (comcast), not sure why. The website...but not the individual emails from my contacts.The touchscreen is pretty sensitive and sometimes I end up having to do things twice.I gave my review four stars only...because of my email restrictions and the sensitivity of the touchscreen.Overall I do love the size and the many things you can do with the NookColor.FYI...I typed this review on my NookColor...",5.0,GENIUS!!....for only $249.00,1298851200,"02 28, 2011",Electronics,1.0

The nook is awesome but if you want 4g, not going to work, if you want more apps, this isn't it.If you want to just be able to read SOME books, this will work. i had a list of books i wanted to buy and just assumed they would be available on the nook and their not, so that was a bummer. I did buy the kindle first and hated it next to the nook. this is def nicer looking being in color and the kidle has sponsor ads all the time which is really annoying.  The nook does have some cool kids books where it reads to them so its been nice to keep my 3 year old busy.  its for the most part user friendly but i def need to go through the tour because sometimes it takes me back to the book i was reading when im just trying to get to another book.  its nice that i can check my email but it is a bummer to not be able to use it wherever im at.

It doesn't have much space for anything else but books, so if you plan to not use all the fancy features and apps it has, this one's for you.I got this as a gift for my mom... She doesn't really use it (in fact, she gave it to me!), but it's a really good investment. It is much more convenient than lugging around two to five books of your favorite series. Also, it's very convenient to have pretty much your entire library at your fingertips! It's not heavy at all, and it is nicely customizable.The huge downside for me is, this reader can't read any files for comic books. As an avid comic book lover with more than 300 digital comic books, I don't like that one bit. Another downside is, the PDF's aren't with the other book files. I happen to have many PDF's I enjoy reading, so that's a bit of an inconvenience for me.I will say this: if you own or are thinking about owning an iPad, do NOT buy this item! iBooks can read ePub and PDF formats, and there are apps you can download for free to read CBR (comic book) files. Or, if you have an iPhone and don't mind reading on that tiny screen, you're good to go!Anyway, overall, this product is sweet.

I like the color, the back lit screen, and the online capabilities.  I get no eye strain from the back lighting, I love that aspect.Two stars for customer service.My problem stems from Barnes and Noble's company policy regarding replacement of defective units.  My Nook Color developed problems being able to consistently connect to a wifi signal, at home, remotely, or at a Barnes and Noble store.  I've had my Nook for 7 months now and this problem has gotten worse over time.  I spoke w/ a tech support person once who was no help, then a second who said I needed a replacement.  A few days later I received a replacement, pretty quick, impressed; until I opened the box and found a CERTIFIED PRE-OWNED NOOK.  When I called customer support, they couldn't give me a straight answer about why that happened but with all the nonsensical things they told me, I deduced that it is Barnes and Noble policy to send certified pre-owned replacements to replace a defective unit. After several attempts I finally was able to talk to a manager who confirmed that policy.  If your Nook malfunctions beyond 30 days of purchase, you will receive a used Nook.  Even w/ an extended warranty, which by the way, in the store, I was told I'd get a brand new replacement, apparently the extended warranty only covers you for a certified pre-owned previously defective Nook.The Nook Color is great, as long as it is working properly.

The video is very choppy for watching streaming video.  No one likes watching a netflix movie with a bunch of squares on the screen.  Barnes and Noble has its own OS, therefore many of the games that are free in the android market cost on the nook color (specifically angry birds).In the end, if you want this to play some games (free or those you are willing to play) this would be okay.  Especially since you can add an Micro SD card to expand the memory available.  But, if you want to get this for someone who will watch netflix on it...or use it for really anything other than an eReader, I would think twice about not just getting a tablet.

Our inkjet printers were killing us in ink cost and never worked when we wanted as the ink dried up if not used in a couple of weeks. So found this used on craigslist and bought it. Works wonderful as a picture viewer as intended. Just plug into computer USB port and find Nook folders and just drag pictures into it. Easy to do exactly like a memory stick - -in fact you could use your Nook to save anything you want. Colors are perfect for pictures and screen can be adjusted for brightest viewing - -eats more battery power -or reduce brightness for darker areas. Works great to show people pictures - -pinch and zoom capability is super-screen is very responsive - -maybe too much at times as sometimes you don't even need to touch the screen - just be very close. Works very fast to swipe from picture to picture. After we had it a while I set up our wi-fi at home (DSL Verizon) and was I surprised at the speed of the internet browsing--way way faster than our home computer. Somewhat limited browser capabilities- I read somewhere it is Google Chrome Mobile but super fast.People say need to root this device for best apps but why do you need more than the 10,700 available??? Many free ones available and most are reasonably priced. Why do you need the apps anyway? Maybe games and some other special stuff but this thing has email, internet, sound player, movie player, picture viewer, ereader, wi-fi radio all built in. I converted movies from DVD to mp4 (using excellent free program called Handbrake and Ipod settings) and loaded them into this thing and it plays them wonderfully - -reduce the brightness and turn off the wi-fi and battery life can be hours. Plug in a micro SD card and have up to 32gig extra space - enough for many movies and pictures to carry with you. We might need this for entertainment when hurricanes knock out our power.Find a McDonalds on the road and connect to wi-fi easily and again use the built in browser for maps and information on the road. Even though no 3G capability built in you can get a personal hot spot wi-fi device (could be a bit expensive but not more than a 3G account an another device) and this will tie into that and enable internet and email on the go.Speaking of rooting. I tried one of the rooted bootable SD card setups--about 1 year ago (early 2012) - -I did it myself from the internet--plug in the micro sd card and turn on the device. Will boot into android. Looks great but when I tried to plug it into my home computer Windows never saw the device so I could not put in pictures and movies--see update below. Tried all the various settings and turned on stuff as directions said but never could get it to work. And pictures and movies already in the device were invisible and could not access these. So perhaps one of the latest versions of android might be better. But it works super good as is for what we want it for.--UPDATE: Found out when you plug the usb cord into the device a tiny symbol appears at the bottom of the screen--when you touch this and move it up with your finger the screen says ""enable usb?""--hit yes and now USB works perfect--i was not aware most android devices are like this--the original Nook Color just works--no need to turn it on.Update June 2014-I found a Nook color at a pawn shop for $15 and decided to root the device with Cyanogen 10-which is Android 4.3. Works quickly but internet is now very slow-almost useless-original Nook browser is very fast but what they give you is way slow. Tried firefox and dolphin but still very slow. Also Tried using galley without sd card and no pictures or movies show up there even though they are in the memory. Seems to be only bug if this is a bug. Found lots of free apps and loaded many and almost all work flawlessly except the one I want which is nook color tweaks--free app--which ""greatly"" increases speaker volume output-too bad as this is only for android 2 and nothing newer--I recommend Cyanogen 7 as most apps work with this older android version and nook color tweaks works well to increases speaker volume.Also yes the USB connector on the Nook it tiny and you must be careful when you plug it in as if just a bit off you can't get it to plug in but be careful and don't bang it or force it --be gentle as all electronic devices now have tiny connectors and charging ports and most are hard to plug in. It seems sturdy enough as some people complain it is poor design - -I think they are like those Gorilla baggage handlers in that old Samsonite TV commercial --just too rough and no patience.",5.0,Nook Color is the Best and Excellent Picture Viewer -10700 apps available,1368662400,"05 16, 2013",Electronics,1.0

I already decided against an iPad because the funds simply are not there and I really do not have any need for an iPad. The two things about the Kindle that drew me in were the screen and the ability to buy from Amazon. I decided to check out the NOOKcolor to see the differences. Yes, the screen can have a bit of a glare, but this does not bother me much since I do not read outside anyhow. The main things that drew me to the NOOKcolor was the ability to check my email, Facebook, color, and the awesome read along feature for the children's books. Since my laptop's fan crapped out, I needed something temporary to perform my daily online checks. The NOOkcolor was right up my alley.Please note I have only had my Nook for a week and have not explored all its capabilities or features. I am only commenting on what I have played around with since I bought it.Cons:-The screen has a glare. This may be important to those who read outside, but the brightness adjustment can cut it down significantly as long as one makes the adjustments. (This does not bother me since, as I have mentioned, I do not read outside.)-My plug is a little loose and my battery notification pops up every now and again if I move around too much while reading plugged in.-Again, if I move a bit too much, it can jump a few pages. In my experience, it has only done this twice and it only went back 2 pages and I was moving to get more comfortable when it happened.Pros:-The screen brightness control makes it nice to read whether it is daytime or you are reading in the dark. My eyes do not get tired or hurt.-Color pages for children books, magazines and other fun things to do on the Nook.-Easy navigation. I did not find it difficult to navigate my Nook at all. I know where everything is and how to get there. It is just a matter of learning how to get there....like anything else.-Wi-Fi. I did not have an issue connecting to my home network (n) or signing up. Web pages load pretty quickly and I am able to check my email and Facebook with no issues.-LendMe option. You can lend your books to your friends and vice versa. Nice feature!Conclusion: It is a good buy for an eBook. If you are expecting it to everything an iPad does, then do not buy this because you will be extremely disappointed. It's main function is to be an eReader....not a fully functional computer or tablet.Suggestion: If you have issues with your Nook or Nook account....go INTO the actual store and get help. Face-to-face is better than talking to someone who cannot see the issue themselves. You will be better off in the long run and get the customer service you want or need. :)",4.0,Good Buy for an eReader,1300838400,"03 23, 2011",Electronics,1.0

I have a hard time connecting a lot of things wirelessly to it.  I had to use an AT&T hotspot in order to register it, not a bad thing but not ideal either.  I bought a casecrown case from ebay and I love that too.  I wish I could give this a 5 star rating but I just can't.  The touch screen is too sensitive and whenever I try to scroll down my library it opens up a book.  I can overlook this because it's only an inconvenience at this point.  I know the battery life isn't the greatest because it's backlit, fine I get that.  However when I tried to use it while it was charging it kept shocking me so I wound up putting it down and doing something else.  That too I can overlook.  What I can't overlook is Barnes and Noble themselves.  Their site has been messed up over the holidays and they're having some issues with my account and the 2 gift cards I have on file.  I've called them many times about it and they just can't seem to get it right.  I can't buy anything with the 2 gift cards on file because they tell me their digital service has been acting up and the magazine that I purchased was declined from the gift card.  They tried to charge it to my credit card but their system won't let them edit the payment.  They tried to rerun the gift card but it won't let them do that either.  They can't cancel it and can't reprocess it and the numerous hours I've been on hold hasn't resolved the issue.  I wouldn't care about that but now my account from B & N is frozen and I can't download any new material and I have books coming out later in the month that I want to own the day they come out.  They tell me they're trying to fix it and to give them some time but I don't have time to be on hold hours at a time in order to see how they're coming along with fixing the issue.

At first we were quite pleased. But, my wife likes to read romance novels. So when we downloaded several, we were shocked to find out that you can not ""hide"" or lock the sometimes risque covers from view. So when the kidswould go on to read the books they wanted, there in clear view were mom and dads titles. You can delete the titles from the Nook, but only by going onto B-N website and deleting. Then you have to use a wireless connection and sync the Nook. It is a real hassle.And as far as the Apps. They are mostly little kids apps. Very few good utility apps are available. And I now know why the Nook always advertises the Angry Bird app. Because that is the only one I downloaded that actually worked well.Downloading books from your local library is difficult at best through the use of Adobe E-reader.

Once your battery dies after the warranty ends, you basically throw this device away or are tethered to a wall outlet.  Which is another annoying thing, no car charger or USB charger!?!  When you buy a mobile device, you expect it to be mobile.  I have had issues with batteries in cell phone/laptops/etc where the battery no longer holds a charge.  Luckily, I have always been able to replace the battery.  Can you imagine having to throw out your laptop or cell phone when the battery starts to go bad?  It seems totally stupid since the other B&N reader has a battery you can replace, why not this one also?  I expressed my concern with B&N customer service and they could care less, they confirmed that after the warranty, no repairs can be made.  I think it is misleading to compare this to other products which are meant to last and can have the batteries replaced.  Not too friendly for the environment.  If concerned with being ""green"", better off buying books.  The one feature I do love is how easy it fits into a purse or can be carried around.

I settled on the nook color for these reasons.* Children Books where my kids remained engaged with the colorful pictures.  The Read to Me feature on some books is awesome for my young nieces.  And they like to swipe between the pages.* Being able to read books checked out from the library.  This was the biggest feature for me.  If you currently check out electronic books from your library and use Adobe Digital all you need to do is plug your nook into your computer wait for the little icon to appear in Adobe Digital then drag and drop the book to your nook.  Poof! your book is now on your nook.* Ability to read multiple formats of ebooks.  All of them except Kindle :(  Maybe that will come available one day.* Access to the internet.  I love being able to access news sites and read/answer my email.* Has expandable memory.  The Nook comes with 5Gigs of internal memory.  But you can expand that memory with a SD mini card.  I am told you can expand up to 32 Gigs, but I only have a 2 Gig card and it seems plenty for now.* I can store my photos and music on the nook and play them whenever I'm reading or want to show off my photos to friends and family.* Size of the nook is perfect to carry around and it feels solid.  It doesn't feel like it will fall apart in your hands.Now with all of these features, it was enough to purchase the nook and I wasn't disappointed.  The touch screen is extremely responsive.  Reading outside, I thought would be an issue, but it is not.  I just adjust the screen brightness and the sunlight isn't an issue any more.  The only issue I found is the speaker isn't very loud, but it does have a headphone jack so then sound doesn't become an issue.  The battery life, will not be able to compare to eInk readers since it is powering a backlit screen.  I usually get a good full day's charge out of it with heavy use.  In reality, these are so minor to me for what this little gem can do.Another thing to be aware of, you must have wifi to connect the nook to register it and set it up.  It doesn't have 3G so those who were hoping for that it isn't an option with this particular model.Now if you are sold just by the above description, there is more!  Recently B&N; released a major update to the nook color.  The Nook Color is now a mini tablet!  They added more features such as easy access to your emails.  Got multiple accounts?  Nook handles that in one application.  They added an app feature where you can now download apps to add even more functionality.  You have an office app, where you can create, edit word, excel documents and then save them either to your SD card or to dropbox or google documents.  They added flash capability where now virtually every page on the internet is available to you now.  They also have games available.  Lots of fun apps, but so far, it isn't a huge store but I can see it growing rapidly.  You can now also put your own ebooks you download onto the home page (not just B&N; books) for easy access to open that book to read.I know there are other features available on the nook that I have not tried yet, like doing movies.  You will have to convert any movies to the format that nook plays.  I will have to try that one soon.I think the only thing the nook cannot do now, is take photos, skype or instant messages.  I can see that as they improve their platform, instant messaging might come available.  Since there is no camera on the nook, it won't take pictures or skype.  For me, these are non issues.  I have a camera on my phone and a real one, which I prefer to take pictures with.  I just don't see me anytime soon wanting to hold up a large tablet to take a picture.The nook color is first and foremost a color eReader.  But it has now quickly morphed into an affordable tablet.  So if you wanted to at least try a tablet but don't want to invest a whole lot of money into one, the nook color is an affordable option.  I'm not disappointed..

He said he  sent a number of Emails and they didn't  respond or when they did they say read the manual.

The prices of straight tablets were outrageous to me when my primary purpose was to eliminate taking the laptop along to be able to review email and do moderate web browsing on a decent sized screen (the phone was way too small).  After reading several reviews and recommendations, I settled on a used Nook Color for both price and performance.  I have not been disappointed.  I have rooted my device for a full blown Android experience and a far superior web browser but rooting is not needed for the basics. I'm just someone who likes to tinker.Everyone needs to understand, this is an e-reader first and a tablet second even when rooted.  At $200, you cannot expect what you would get with a $500-$600 device.  But, it does what it is intended to do quite well.  At 7 inches the screen is comparable size to most e-readers and that was important to me for portability.  I simply swapped the e-ink reader for the Nook Color and it still fit perfectly in my purse.  The Nook Color is also really good for reviewing emails and smooth web browsing.  My rooted device has an overclocked processor so I have no problems with speed.  It's perfect for quickly reaching out to the web to check the latest news, weather, etc. and then get right back to reading my books.  I haven't had many problems running other Android tablet applications and have found that the problems I have had seem to be common problems with the applications themselves.If you want a premium e-reader, this is a super nice product at a great price.  If you're looking for a budget tablet without all of the bells and whistles (camera, gps, microphone) but that will handle the basics of email, web browsing, Netflix, Hulu Plus, and other consumption tasks, this is more than adequate and enjoys much more favorable reviews than similarly priced tablets (with the exceptions of the Kindle Fire and its own successor the Nook Tablet).  The bottom line with this little marvel is to keep your expectations in line with what you're paying for and what you're not paying for. If you expect a $200 version of the standard bearer (i.e IPad), then you'll be very happy.

(It also takes a macroSD card). While you can find the Kindle rooted too, I found the Nook Color rooted was more readily available and more affordable.

The rooted Nook Color can do everything a tablet can do except for make or receive phone/video calls.Note, all rooted Nook Colors are not the same version.  We purchased one for our son for this Christmas and I did not notice it was not cyanogenmod 7.  This is relevant as it did not possess full access to all of the apps on the Google Play (or Android market) as our daughter's does.

I can make the text as big as I need and adjust the background lighting, so that I seldom need my reading glasses. (That's a plus, right there!).  I can even read in bed, without distrubing my husband and turning on the light.  That's right! I can read in the dark!

To begin with, the navigation is not very responsive. The select text feature works most of the time, but fails often enough to be really annoying. Many of the books are not easily moved around in. For example, in a copy of the KJB I bought, the book headings in the TC do not take you to the book - you have to use the slide feature and guess roughly where, say, Ruth begins. Very frustrating and time-consuming. Indexes are not navigable in the books I've bought.Some books just seems to be defective. I bought a poetry anthology that I can't get to work - it just stalled out on a certain page and is frozen.The ferature that allows you select type size is great, But be aware that some books are just pdf-like texts and if it's small type you're out of luck. Some of the free and cheapy stuff reads up poorly, such as a copy of A Boy's Will where the lines seem to ahve been sprayed around the page at random. Same with Leaves of Grass.There are supopsedly millions of titles available, but unless your taste runs pretty much to contemporary mass market fiction, pornography aimed at the female market and the like you're going to be disappointed in what isn't available.

I actually bought the Nook Color (NC) more for its tablet features than its e-book features.  I considered several tablets for at least double the price, but when the new Android OS was released for the NC, I decided to try it out.  I personally have not been disappointed.Here is what it doesn't have: camera, USB accessory support, fast processor, robust app forum, 3G model, and long battery life.  But as I said I am willing to pay less for less.

I personally have had no problem with the web browser and it has met all of my needs.  Movie viewing has been fine and I have had no problems viewing them.  I use Handbrake to convert movies/videos to a format for the NC, and it works great.  I have several e-mail accounts I use for personal and business purposes, and the POP3 support the NC offers is perfect.  I am no longer tied to my PC, laptop, or confined to the small screen of a mobile phone.

Frankly we wouldn't have bought it if that was all it was. Since the Nook is built on an Android platform there are a few thousand apps to keep you busy between books. The screen colors are very crisp and the video is blu ray quality. We haven't owned either of ours long, but we haven't had to charge the battery yet. It has a very long life.Since we don't own a smartphone, the Nook is the next best thing. Apart from not being able to take a call with it, it will do most everything a smartphone will do without the $100 per month bill. We look forward to taking it on our long drives to use as a way of figuring out what is in the next town, checking gas prices and finding discount hotel rooms on the fly. It will save us a lot more than the purchase price.I'm sure we will find a lot more to do with the Nook over time. We are especially excited to use Netflix when it is released for the Nook. The only reason we gave it four stars instead of five is because there is always room for improvement. Maybe they will find a way to add a phone to it. Skype maybe?If I had one complaint it would be the sound quality.

Gondhalekar,"[12, 12]","I was instantly the hero for my wife this Christmas, when I surprised her with a nook color under the tree. The device has great aesthetics, with a 7 inch IPS LCD display that is one of the most pleasing I've ever laid my eyes on, a thin and sleek profile, wonderful packaging, and nice support from Barnes and Noble, but that as Paul Harvey would say is only the beginning, this review is about the rest of the story.  At first glance this appears like just another eReader, but with a color screen for magazines and children's books swapped in for the normal eInk, but there is something different lurking beneath.  This device runs android 2.1 under the hood, heavily modified as it may be out of the box, and with that choice of operating system comes a potential access a world of hackery that is well beyond the reach of any other eReader.  In order to access this world you need to be willing to educate yourself a bit and root this device.  The process is actually quite simple (go to XDA-Developers forums or nookdevs.com Nook Color portal to read about it), and despite the dire warning disclaimers quite foolproof, and fully reversible (just in case you need warranty service).Once rooted, the device gains access to android market, where you can get thousands of apps, games, and tools for free (legally), or for a small purchase price.  Compared to the currently empty nook app store, the android market is bursting with exciting activity.  A rooted nook color gets access to the kindle app, so you can basically read all your amazon purchases on this device too.  Sony Reader app is coming soon from what I've heard, so you are probably going to get support for that store too.  Tied to the Kobo ecosystem, to borrow a phrase, there is an app for that.  Emulators for old game consoles are working nicely.  Playing Angry Birds on a 7 inch tablet is so much more fun than on a tiny 4 inch phone.  Stock browser lacks pinch to zoom, download Dolphin HD, and there you go.  Can't put app shortcuts and widgets on the home screen, home switcher and one of the freeware launchers (ADW is pretty nice) got your back.  A rooted nook color becomes something of a worthy competitor to the much more expensive iPad and Galaxy Tab.  Unlike real android phones and tablets, this does lack the physical menu, back, and search buttons, but a software softkey is installed upon rooting, so there are functional on-screen virtual equivalents to do the job.Don't get me wrong, there are some things that won't work, as nook color lacks a 3G radio, camera, or GPS.  The ROM is also a heavily modified version, so some abilities have been stripped out, and won't be available until a true custom ROM is available.  But more apps a likely to work than not due to a capable processor, ample storage packed underneath, and most importantly a talented and dedicated hacking community willing to experiment with their device and then educate others.  This is still early in the development life cycle of the nook color, so their are some rough edges to the process, some things will require resorting to the command line to fix.  Considering what you get for the money, this is probably the best handheld portable device on the market today.  An instant game changer without a doubt.",5.0,A great device if you are willing to hack a bit,1293408000,"12 27, 2010",Electronics,1.0

It is very watered down compared to the full version of Android so power users will want to avoid the virgin NC.Now for the good part. With a microsd you can easily install a customized full version of Android. There are a few different versions but CM7 with Gingerbread (2.3) is what most use. Once you install it the NC will be as powerful (or more so) as tablets that cost twice the price. There are some limitations of usage of Android on the NC because of the lack of some hardware buttons but this is a limitation that most tablets have when the apps were built more for phones. Luckily this can be worked around by a freeware app called Button Savior. You really need to take advantage of apps, etc. to supplement the Android OS for things like watching videos (MoboPlayer is great), etc. but the customized version is being worked on constantly so there is hope that eventually there will be fixes for any bugs that aren't officially being worked on. It is a pretty amazing device once it has been modified.As for the hardware it has a good weight for me. It is heavy enough that it feels ""right"" in my hands but not too heavy. This might be too heavy for some though. The build quality is great for the most part but there are a couple of oddities. On the left side you can see the backlighting coming through at two places. This can be offputting but with a silicone protector on it isn't visible. The other thing is that the two sides of the shell will creak when you press down on both sides. The battery life is great for reading and light to moderate browsing but of course the battery will be spent much faster when watching video or playing intense games. You can force the CPU to stay low and use programs like Advanced Task Manager to kill running apps that you no longer are using (which is what every Android user must do for the tradeoff of being able to run everything in the background) to conserve as much power as you can. The battery charges pretty quickly as long as you aren't using the NC -- if you are then it almost doesn't charge at all and sometimes will even still decrease the battery supply if there is intense usage. The WiFi was a little bit on the weak side as opposed to my laptop and iPod Touch 2G but it seems have been resolved with the updates of the customized version of Android.My final impression (as of now with no official version of Android for the NC) is a 3.5 but with the full blown Android it is a 5.",4.0,An OK e-reader but a nice inexpensive tablet,1301184000,"03 27, 2011",Electronics,1.0

I read audio boo...","[1053, 1072]","I've read e-books on just about every device out there, while looking for the perfect mix of features to support them.  I've gone from an ancient Palm III to all the Kindles and other readers that are out there.  First, I must say my favorite way to read a book is via the treeware version - you just can't replace books.  What you can do though is supplement them with a device that adds something to the experience that makes a device worth buying.  For me, my new perfect device is the NookColor.I will cut to the chase and answer the question people are most curious about.  How does it stack up verus e-ink?  Well, as a user of many e-ink devices, I know all about how such devices as Kindle eliminate eye-strain.  This was my first worry with the NookColor.  As it turns out, their is a color/font adjuster that you can change how the books looks until you find something that is pleasing and non-straining to your particular eyes.  While I won't be able to read for five hours straight like on a Kindle, I think four hours straight is a fair trade!One thing I needed with my reader was the ability to access the Internet at times.  This is an area where the NookColor beats out all the e-ink readers with smooth and responsive access to the Net.  I found the touch keyboard easy to use, and the rotating display helpful.The apps are limited to ones that actually work, so there isn't a broad selection like on other devices.  It's just quality ones.  I suppose with their NookDeveloper program, their should be more apps available soon.  Granted they will be a lot of junk apps, as on other devices, but at least there will be variety.The online ""nookstore"" is a little more inviting than Amazon's in that it feels like you are a browsing through a variety of options, and not just a list.I liked the in-store features too.  It was nice to check out any book for free while there.  Plus, you can download additional free books, only while in a Barnes & Noble.I like how you can highlight and put notes on your text very easily.  While there are several colors available to highlight, I just found out you can highlight a highlight.  The mark gets darker and darker as with a real pen, so you can extra emphasize a passage if needed.  And if you can't wait to share a passage, you can zap it straight to your facebook and twitter to share with your friends, while you keeping on reading.  It's cooler than it sounds!I will probably upadte this review in a few days, as I discover more features.  So, far this seems to be the best collection of features I have found on an ereader, for me personally.  I understand the things people like in their prefered reader, but for me, this is the best!**UPDATE**Well... I said I would update my review in a ""few days"" but it has been more like a year almost! :)  Am I still satisfied?  YES!  It's interesting how the Nook Color has evolved since I wrote this review (I bought it the first day it was available).  So much has changed, such as improved performance (they upgrade your Nook wirelessly) and the new app store.  I had been disappointed with the first apps, but apps that have been coming out over the last month are great!  The touch screen is responsive and always activates where I touch, unlike some other pads.  The app prices are comparable to other Android stores, though their selection is limited to 100% proven safe apps.I have used my Nook Color almost EVERYDAY since I wrote this review.  It's role in my life is more than I expected, as it is primary smart device.  Whenever I need those short ""checks of the internet"", I can grab it and be on the net in seconds.  Being able to access the internet whenever I want (on a readable screen) has been invaluable.  I have used it in all situations as a backup for logging in to an online class to reading color PDFs in bed.  In fact, as soon as I am done with this review, I am going to go lay on my bed and surf Amazon from my Nook Color.  Since the it has a secure full featured browser (remember 100% safe apps) I can even order stuff when I want. Then maybe I could watch a few streaming videos until I fall asleep!**Third Update**Felt I should check in and give everyone an update on the Nook Color I have had since day 1. It feels strange saying this, but IT KEEPS GETTING BETTER! Seriously, I had been happy enough with my Nook, but they keep releasing updates to give it more features than I thought it would have when I bought it. I don't think I have ever owned a piece of tech that upgrades itself before, and for free. B&N; deserves some kudos for that support. The latest video upgrades (to support Netflix in particular) have also improved playback on other video sites as well.Comparing it to the other leading tablets out there, I will say that it is better than an iPad as you will not get this long of support from Apple.. heck, your battery wouldn't even last this long! ;) j/kNow for the Kindle Fire... The support and durability are also awesome, as even my Kindle 1 is still ticking fine. The speed is about equal on them, though more apps are being released on Amazon lately. If I had to suggest a way of picking between those two, it would be if you have Prime or not. All else being the same, Nook Color is great, however the benifits of Prime membership give the Fire a slight edge for the media user.Okay, that's the update and see you again in a year!",5.0,Tried them all and now I found it!,1290297600,"11 21, 2010",Electronics,1.0

My goal was to be able to carry a few books around for pleasure, maybe even some business documents.  Even though I have an iPhone, I thought I would diversify and go after an Android based platform.  I figured that even if I decided to go with the iPad eventually I could use the Nook app on the iPad to read the books that I've bought.After a few weeks of using it, I'm close to handing it over to the kids or jailbreaking it for experimentation with Android, and getting an iPad.1) The quality is low.  The software is buggy, ironically one of the buggiest parts is trying to buy a book, where it more often than not hangs after a purchase with the download in limbo.  The battery charge socket seems to be flakey, so that often the unit gets confused about whether it is charging or now.2) Can't buy books when you're outside the US.  So, on an international business trip - when it'd be nice to pick up a few books for the plane or to pass time in a cafe - one can't buy a book.  That sucks.3) Although in theory I could load a bunch of PDF documents onto it for reading, the display is too small for them.  The interface for PDF documents, in terms of adjusting fonts, scrolling, is very limited.  Device is useless for this.4) The book selection is slim.  I don't think my tastes are that obscure, but I'm not interested in the mass market.  Forget pulling out old sci fi classics.  Forget getting a textbook.  And I find that some of the books that I would like to read are available for the Kindle but not the Nook.5) The iPhone Nook app is super buggy.  In theory it should let me sync, get my books on the iPhone too.  But the iPhone app just hangs and doesn't sync to my account, even after a reinstall.

I probably should have waited until all the kinks were worked out by B&N;, or even waited for a second version.Pros: The battery time is nowhere near as bad as many reviews say it is.  I read and/or surfed the web every night for an hour or two and didn't need to charge it for 5 days (as long as you turn it off each time instead of putting it on standby).  The color looks great and the book-reading does not bother my eyes at all with the LCD screen (as long as I keep the brightness down as low as it goes when reading at night).  The number of free domain books you can download is amazing.  You could ready for months without ever having to purchase a book.  You can also rent books from your local library if they allow e-book rentals (unfortunately, if you are in a county that doesn't have that available, the only way to rent library books is by paying for a library card, i.e. you can purchase a NY public library card for $100 per year).  Basically it seems like there is a caveat for every pro.Cons: Even with the firmware updates, it seems to lose wi-fi connectivity once about every half hour when searching for books or on the web. There are rumors that some android apps will soon be available, but like many tablets with android OS, android market apps will not be available (without a hack).  As of now, there are no apps (just a couple chess and sudoku that come with it). The lack of pinch and zoom for the web is a real issue, it makes navigating your account on the B&N; website quite difficult.  And their customer service is terrible.  You get a 14 day free trial of any magazine & newspaper subscriptions when you buy the Nook, but each one was charged to my credit card.  I spent 34 minutes on hold before reaching a customer service rep, and then she couldn't see each of the subscriptions, she could only view one at a time, but the one she saw was indeed charged to my credit card and so she had to transfer me to another rep. At this point they actually had to state a disclaimer that I may be on hold ""a considerable length of time"".

Each one has advantages, but none more than the B&N; Nook Color. Hold the Nook in your hand and you hold a reader, tablet PC, MP3 player, and photo viewer. It seems like it should be a work-out, but no so. With an optional leather cover (many cool choices at B&N;'s site) it weighs in at about a pound. Heavier than the Kindle? Sure, but also does so much more.The features that make this a stand-out are the 7"" color touch screen, full keyboard, and Android-based browser. The browser is a MAC, so Flash video is not supported, but all others are. YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, email and everything else appears just as it does on your PC. Page turns are an effortless swipe on the screen.Two things I consider drawbacks are, first and foremost, the battery life. Don't expect more than 7 or 8 hours. B&N; says 10 days, but that's in hibernation mode. That drawback is kind of big. I'm forever charging the Nook, and charge time is 4-5 hours. The other drawback is backlighting, which is unfortunate but necessary for the brilliant color screen. Adust the page color in ""Settings"" and reduce the eye-strain.Aside from the battery life, the Nook Color is the best thing going out there.

Customer service had me on the phone for about 45 minutes and took me through two factory re-sets before I finally convinced them to replace my second unit.  Note that all replacements of defective devices are re-furbished, not new.  Finally, I am experiencing what Barnes & Noble had in mind.

I think it is great, but a few things made me change my mind about the nook and I just bought a Kindle HD. First, the page numbers shown in the book are not accurate compared to a paper copy of a book. I do a lot of research for school and it makes a difference to my research and even pleasure reading if I know what an exact page number is so I can go back to a paper copy if I need to and know my place instead of using a search tool to find it within a 30 page estimate of where it is. Most pages in the Nook seem to be about thirty pages off from the real paper book.Second, it had somewhat poor customer support--for example finding the free books that are supposedly offered and easy to locate! I had to call Barnes and Noble after searching webpages on Barnes and Noble for ""free books for Nook"" to find a list of recent free books and the answer I recieved was you have to type in a product title ON THE BARNES AND NOBLE WEBPAGE and then the awkward number, 0.0, to find a free book! So, Barnes and Noble makes customers pretty much look up a book in order to find out it is free, but what is the use of that? On a Kindle you can browse easily what is free! I actually typed in 0.0 without a title on the Barnes and Noble webpage and it brought up about 40,000 titles that were almost all trashy fiction books or kids titles.... So at least with a Kindle you truly have a source of titles that are interesting and New York Times Reviewed in some cases that are not hidden in a mirage of kids books and boring fiction novels. On the nook, I only got about two books for free because I could only think of two titles that did not have a copyright that I wanted to read, and they need to make the process of skimming the ""free"" books a little easier than typing a 0.0 in a search bar because if you get more specific than that you also pull up titles that do cost money.There are a few customer service problems I have come across trying to figure out parts of my Nook programs. For example, when I download a book JUST ON MY PC it won't even add it to my library unless I uninstall the entire program and re-install it! I tried figuring it out with two different customer service representatives and had to problem solve myself after they dropped the phone calls! And that was unfortunately on a night I REALLY needed access to a downloaded book just on my PC for school.So, a Kindle will actually drop a book in the Kindle library on the PC without having to re-install the entire Nook PC program, which is a precious waste of time that should not be a problem on a pretty nice Sony laptop that was fresh out of the box in the summer of 2010! Furthermore, I am amazed that every time I install a new version of the nook PC application, it has the same problem no matter how updated the software became. Also, unfortunately, my Nook PC and my Nook itself are pretty disconnected with each other, so if I add a book on my nook it never shows up on my Nook PC unless I uninstall everything and waste 30 minutes of my time including computer restarts!Finally, I think Kindle's connection with amazon and all of its benefits means something about its product appeal. Amazon negotiated deals with Netflix and many companies to help its customers and allows them to use their products anywhere that includes a television, mac, e-reader, and PC anywhere on Earth--but Nook won't even allow customers to BUY a book in a ANY PHYSICAL LOCATION other than the United States . . . and that is just a bummer. I have only been outside the U.S. four times, but I also want to travel and use my  e-reader abroad and cannot buy titles abroad with a Nook. The Kindle company managed to negotiate the entire Harry Potter books and make them available from JK Rowling who did not want to even allow the books to be sold on a Kindle or a Nook  . . . yet nook is not willing to pull enough strings and work enough boardroom tables to allow customers to buy a book abroad! I just think Amazon looks out for its customers more and am putting my future electronic books on a kindle, unfortunately, after being a faithful Nook reader for more than 18 months and despite losing about ten books I bought electronically through the Nook programs.I think the Nook can be great, but its perceived benefits don't appeal to me anyway . . . and customer service is terrible. In addition to everything I just mentioned, they even did not send me a ""welcome pack"" of coupons for my Nook and when I called after six weeks to find out what happened they were a tiny bit ungracious about sending it out when it was supposed to come with it anyway . . . and when I got it the coupons were pretty worthless and nowhere near the ""100"" dollar value they supposedly advertised unless you are interested in a gender-specific and even kid-targeted titles. So I think the Nook has a few duplicitous ""offers"" that are not really real and do not make it worth buying a Nook. I think the most duplicitous advertising campaign associated with the Nook is its perceived video usability! The advertisements for the Nook Color clearly show short videos on it, but it really only handles extremely low-quality viewing and short videos... so that is another reason I think Barnes and Noble needs to be a little more transparent to its customers given that all of the Nook Color advertisements clearly showed moving animations and a couple videos... but you would have to ask a store representative after you bought the Nook about why 95% of short videos on the internet cannot be played on a Nook Color, unfortunately.",3.0,"Outdated, Literally Failed to Deliver, and has More than a Few Glitches with Usability and Customer Service Offers",1358121600,"01 14, 2013",Electronics,0.0

First, I couldn't decide between the NOOK and a Kindle, but as my wife had a NOOK and was very pleased, I decided to go with that. When I got it, I was very excited. I turned it on and was instructed to find a wireless network to start with. It found my wireless network, I input the password, and nothing.... It wouldn't respond. It wouldn't take my perfectly legitimate password. I'm supposed to be a minor techie, but I couldn't get it to respond, which ticked me off. However, my wife did something to it -- I don't know what -- and it took it and my wireless has been fine since. (However, yesterday my wife lost HER wireless connection although every other wireless connection in the house was fine, so she had to restart her NOOK, which seemed to work.) Then, after I was in my new NOOK, I looked around the store some, downloaded a book, magazine, and a few apps, and then wondered how to access libraries to get free books to read. There were no instructions anywhere, although I know people do this. My wife did it, for Pete's sake! Well, she told me I had to download an Adobe app called Overdrive Media Console in order to access libraries and library books. How in the world I would have discovered that on my own is beyond me and I think it stinks that there's not an easier way that Barnes & Noble could have built into the device. Nonetheless, I downloaded the app. It wouldn't install. I was about to pull my hair out when my lovely wife came to my aid once more and got it working. I accessed my local library, where I have an account and downloaded a book. However, when I went to other libraries to check out their selections, I found that they charge fees, like $50 to become a member just to download their books! That's crazy! What could it possibly cost these libraries to have out of town/state members download their books? What a ripoff. Anyway, I started using my NOOK and haven't had any trouble since. Just a bumpy beginning. I like reading magazines on this device. That's the whole point of getting Color, isn't it? The Article View is a nice feature and makes it easy to read magazine articles. It's very different, however, when it comes to books. That is, it's easy to read books I've bought and downloaded -- just choose them with my stylus. But to open a library book, I first have to open my Overdrive Media Console app and get through several screens before I can begin reading. Oh well. I have my email enabled on my NOOK, as well as my Twitter feed, DropBox, and Pinterest too. It would be nice to have a Facebook app, but it doesn't yet have one, so you can use the built in browser for that. It's also possible to upload pictures and songs from your computer, but I haven't done that yet. The NOOK is light and it's easy to read, for which I'm grateful. You can modify the screen brightness, which was important to me. I haven't tried out newspapers yet, but hope to soon. Oh, about magazines. Individual issues can be pricey, but if you subscribe, they have pretty reasonable fees. Most cost only $1.99 a month, which is a huge savings off the individual price for both NOOK and paper issues. It's a good deal. It seems to be a good e-reader or tablet or whatever they're called these days and after getting by the first hurdles, I'm now glad I bought this product and heartily recommend it to others.",4.0,Pretty Good,1369008000,"05 20, 2013",Electronics,1.0

Much to my dismay when I later had time to go through all of the books I'd purchased and play with text sizing and font options, I found that this was not the case. Indeed, the maximum size for many of the texts was too small to be read by people with visual impairments.My plea to Barnes & Noble, Publishers, Amazon and other vendors who produce ebooks is to please keep pepole with visual disabilities in mind and adhere to standards that will meet various needs. In the US alone, there are millions of partially sighted people who need for text to be enlarged, made bold, underlined, etc. My feeling is that 'corrected' versions of these books should be released and people who have already purchased them should be given the option to get free download replacements.Personally, I have visually impaired people in my family and I will no longer purchase any book that does not at least allow for larger text sizes.Nook color is a great device but in the end it is only as good as the software and texts that is uses, so for now I rate it 3 stars until the above issues are addressed and implemented.

Thinking that is was only non-replaceable by the user and that it could obviously be shipped back to the manufacturer for replacement..I called B&N; technical support. They told me that in fact the battery was non-replaceable and I could buy their extended warranty if I wanted to cover the battery for an additional 2 years after the one year manufacturers warranty. If my battery died after the warranty period was up, I was told they would not replace the battery. Basically I would have to buy a new unit.I took it back to Barnes and Noble and explained that I was not willing to throw $250.00 down the drain because they wouldn't replace the battery at any point in the future. The sales people had no idea. They were under the impression that the Nook could be sent back ay any time for a replacement battery.

This is all despite having an international credit card accepted all over the United States (even by Barnes & Noble themselves as this is the same card that I used to pay for my B&N; membership) and despite even giving them my US postal and physical address where all of my packages would be signed for  by a real person.The thing that angers me the most is that I explained to Barnes & Noble (via phone) that I live in Trinidad and they said that it would not be a problem for me to purchase books, but after purchasing a Nook color plus additional items such as screen protectors, a leather case and a 32 gig Sandisk memory card (all bought on Amazon), I have not been able to purchase a single book.If International Customers are not welcome, there should at least be some type of warning on their website. I feel like I was ripped-off by Barnes & Noble, and the sad thing about it is that I bought it all as a birthday gift for my wife. Shame on Barnes & Noble, that sales rep lied to me just to make a sale, my money was good enough for them but I am not good enough for their product. Now I have this New Nook color with all of these extras just gathering dust.It is sad to see just how low some companies will stoop to make a dollar.The real slap in the face is that after registering the nook on the Barnes & Noble website for the purpose of purchasing books, they have no problem sending me offers week after week to purchase even more of their products but as far as I am concerned, they have lost this customer permanently.P.S. This review has nothing whatsoever to do with Amazon.com, my gripe is with Barnes & Noble for giving false information to secure a sale and caring nothing about International Customers.(UPDATE  UPDATE  UPDATE)In the interest of fairness to Barnes & Noble and giving you Amazon.com community 100% reliable information I decided to open an account with a bank that's based in the USA to see if B&N; would be able to access the funds from that account, I'm trying to find out whether it's a location issue or just a payment issue so we can all know for sure.I decided to try this little experiment because I just can't understand how I can gain access to sample books from B&N; but every time I try to purchase one there seems to be a problem, what makes this whole thing even more confusing is the e-mail that was sent by B&N; after I tried to purchase a Book via my Scotia Master Card (books can only be sold to customers ""physically"" residing in the United States).I now have a Bank Of America Visa Debit Card which I have not tried as yet, it is possible that the issue with Barnes & Noble is that they cannot access funds from my Scotia Master Card which is based in Trinidad so I will give the Bank Of America card a try seeing that it's based in the USA and if that does not work then the last resort will be to try using my Pay Pal account. I'll post an update as to whether it worked or not.(UPDATE  UPDATE  UPDATE)I'm sorry for taking so long but anyway, let us get on with it.  As I said before, every time I tried to purchase a book there seems to be a problem, what makes this whole thing even more confusing is the e-mail that was sent by B&N; after I tried to purchase a Book via my Scotia Master Card (books can only be sold to customers ""physically"" residing in the United States).Well I found out that IT IS POSSIBLE to purchase books on the Nook once you are using a US based card. I was not able to purchase books using my Scotia Master Card but I had no problem whatsoever when using my Bank of America Visa Card, so it definitely has nothing to do with our geographical location, or IP address. The only issue that I see here is the fact that not everyone has access to a US Bank Card but you may still have a chance with making purchases via PayPal.I have noticed that there are some US based sellers that have problems accessing funds from Trinidad based Credit Cards, some even have problems accessing funds from US based Cards although they are also in the US themselves, in cases like this I've found that the best payment method to avoid any headaches is via PayPal. I've never had any issue when paying via PayPal, even when other forms of payment could not work.I hope that this helps a little.",1.0,INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMERS BEWARE,1332374400,"03 22, 2012",Electronics,0.0

Our county library lends out e readers for patrons to try so I got on the list and after three months it was my turn to try the Kindle Color Nook. It doesn't overwhelmingly impress me though the color and clarity of the screen is as good as Our Kindle Fire's. Text on the screen is clear and turning the pages is easy. ONE advantage the Nook has over the Fire is that it shows page numbers instead of the Fire's percent of book read. Mrs. Spudman would prefer to have page numbers but has adapted to the percents.My wife and I are both comfortable navigating the Fire and barely had to refer to the owner's e manual. I don't like moving around on the Nook, and that may be solely because I'd become used to the ease of the Fire. Trying to surf the web on the Nook was very frustrating, and watching movies or video clips on the Nook was an ordeal with herky jerky motion, slow responses, and freezes. We watch free TV shows on the Kindle Fire with smooth enjoyment.The Fire was a gift to my wife from me. She loves it. If I were to buy a small device for reading, I'd prefer to  buy a tablet and download a reading program on it that enables book downloads. That method may preclude the ability to get free books (it does on the Kindle), but it's a circumstance I'd accept.In summary, the Color Nook is pretty good as a reader. Those with children might be intrigued by the animation capacity of the Nook on some children's books and the option to have the book read aloud by the Nook voice. As a web browser, the Nook , in my experience, doesn't work as well as the Fire does.In choosing between the two devices, I chose the Fire because I prefer the Amazon site to B&N;'s, like the vast number of Kindle books on Amazon, and was totally persuaded by the vast array of  free books, movies, and TV shows that come with Amazon prime.",3.0,A Little Nook e,1332028800,"03 18, 2012",Electronics,0.0

It's the lightest, easiest-to-read, slickest eBook reader out there, bar none. The electronic ink technology is nothing short of amazing. It has literally changed my life.Barnes and Noble did something pretty clever with their latest eBook reader. They didn't try to mimic the Kindle, probably because they knew they couldn't match it. Instead, they looked at what the Kindle didn't have and they incorporated that into their newest Nook.When it came time to buy an Xmas present for my girlfriend, like everyone else, it came between the Kindle and the Nook. While I decided on the Kindle for myself, I decided on the Nook for her. Here are the reasons why you might choose a Nook over a Kindle.1) You have a Barnes and Noble membership. This gives you a discount on all Nook eBooks, as well as occasional discounts. Granted, Amazon's everyday prices are usually a bit cheaper, but the occasional coupons by Barnes and Noble to its members are substantial.2) You live near a Barnes and Noble. Barnes and Noble lets you walk into their store with a Nook and read any book for free for up to an hour.3) You go to the library. Amazon decided not to support library books with the Kindle. It's understandable--after all, while they make some money on the Kindle hardware, the real money they make is in Kindle book sales. But IMO, that was a little short-sighted, and leaves a huge opportunity for Barnes and Noble. With the Nook, I can check eBooks from my local library (the New York Public Library). But as with the real library, that doesn't prevent me from buying books--to the contrary, if I like a book at the library enough, I'll buy it when I otherwise wouldn't have.4) You are annoyed by arrow keys. I admit, while I love the Kindle, the ""tap tap tap"" of the arrow keys to navigate the screen is a bit tedious, especially with games and experimental features like their Web browser. With the Nook, you can drag and drop to your heart's content.5) You have kids. The special color children's books are absolutely beautiful and will certainly appeal to your kids. Letting them use Mommy and Daddy's eBook reader will certainly help them develop a love for reading as they get older, in a way that reading a book on a PC or even an iPad (where mind-numbing games are always a click away) do not.6) You have other friends with the Nook. Barnes and Noble built in a ""Lend Me"" feature which lets you ""lend"" books to friends for up to two weeks.7) You don't mind ""plugging in"". The WiFi and color display of the Nook take a big toll on battery life. If you're lucky, your unit will last 8 hours of reading before needing a recharge (compare this to over a week with the Kindle).8) You have to have color. Reading magazines and the aforementioned children's books, not to mention color diagrams in eBooks and color annotations, really makes a huge difference. And it's probably a good couple of years before color eInk technology is perfected. So for now, the Nook is the best choice for color.9) You don't get eyestrain when looking at a laptop for many hours. There are some who do, for whom eInk technology is definitely the way to go, versus the backlit LCD display of the Nook.10) You need a LOT of storage space. The Nook Color comes with an SD card slot that allows up to 32 Gigabytes of storage with the right SD card. That's 1/320 of the entire print collection of the Library of Congress :)11) You read at night. The backlit LCD screen obviates the need for a nightlight.12) You like to play games and use apps. Since the Nook is based on the Android operating system, there will be more and more of these available. Note, however, that the Android Marketplace is not open to the Nook. Only selective apps are being selected for inclusion on the Nook (presumably based on how well they perform given the Nook's specs).In short, the Kindle set and maintains the bar for the best eBook reader out there, but Barnes and Noble did a great job in putting out an alternative which targets the few things that the Kindle lacks. This is the beauty of the free market system--no doubt, the engineers at Amazon are working feverishly on a new version of the Kindle to answer them. One thing you need to know before buying either the Kindle or the Nook is that in 3-4 years, your purchase will probably be antiquated :) But either of these units are a great purchase for now.",5.0,Barnes and Noble's more-than-adequate answer to the Kindle,1292803200,"12 20, 2010",Electronics,1.0

It's a great device and I like it a lot. I like to read technical and scientific English language PDFs and it works well for the documents I've read so far. The web browser is very usable, and the color display is absolutely gorgeous. In book reading mode, the gestures work well and reading over extended periods of time is quite comfortable.  They included the ability to look up words using either Wikipedia or Google which is a handy feature.  I also like playing Sudoku, chess, and doing crosswords so I was glad they included these extra apps.  I selected the Nook Color over the Kindle because I wanted a good e-book reader and also the ability to surf the web.  I needed the ability to view color content since many of the publications I read have full color photos, diagrams, and visualizations.  This device meets all of those needs.Since this is a 1.0 release, there are clearly minor improvements that Barnes and Noble can make to the user interface.  For example, the touch screen does not always see single and tap gestures correctly, and the automatic screen orientation will occasionally rotate the display the wrong way resulting in an upside down web page. (Easy to fix, you just rotate back to portrait mode, then rotate to the desired landscape orientation.)  The area that could stand the most improvement in my opinion is in the soft keyboard.  Hitting the right characters when you are typing is not a big problem, but my unit has a tendency to echo the same characters requiring me to do deletes.  These quirks are minor and I expect to see firmware upgrades in the near future.The viewing size and weight are ideal so I'm likely to bring the device with me where ever I go.

When NookColor became available, I thought I as happy with the first one and didn't need it. Two weeks ago, on a almost 12 hour(one way)flight, I was content with Nook classic. Well, in Hawaii, as an impulse buy (and cheaper salestax), I bought the NookColor, and am sooo glad I did! After purchase, in the store, I opened it ,registered, signed into my B&N; account and all my books were there (in seconds),including the current book I was reading on the page I left off. As others have said, the NC is very intuitive and easy to learn. It was so much more easier to read on my flight home, i turned down brightness and changed background page to grey. The only problem I had is it is easy to change several pages if you grab it wrong, if you hold left or right side, when moving around in seat. But that was user error! Books and magazines read beautifully, games are better-Sudoku especially and internet works great. And thanks to another user review, I learned about DVD Catalyst (tools4movies.com), a program that converts DVDs and transfers it to your NC! It only costs $9.95. I converted the new Shrek movie and the picture and audio (with headphones) are beautiful on the NC! So now, my desire for IPad has ended, for the NC has everything I need. Books and magazines, internet, e-mail and now movies, all in a smaller (but not too small),lightweight and beautiful package. And it is only going to get better with future updates. I already downloaded 1.0.1, but I have not had any difficulty connecting to Wi-Fi beforehand. All in all, I highly recommend NookColor!

Does many things- some of them great and others so-so. Can go on the internet while taking a break from reading- nice plus. It also holds photos and other downloads.

Downloading the books is automatic from B&N.; Love the ability to highlight words and phrases to go back to and the ability to read several books at once. The biggest advantage of the Nook Color is the ability to download books from the public library! This can't be underestimated. Once you download the Adobe software its simple to download the books and then drag them onto the Nook. This feature makes the Nook a winner. The only real downsides: the battery only lasts about 4-5 hours of reading time, and the directions for library use are not included (had to go on the net to figure it out- guess B&N; doesn't want you to ""borrow"" books for free!) BTW- Do yourself a favor and charge it up before you go to the setup mode. The devise has a weird quirk of being hyper sensitive when using while plugged into the wall, so its easier to then go to B&N; and get the most recent updates once its been charged.

It does a few things well, like being backlit so you can read it at night with no lights.  After that it is all downhill.  Battery life is about that of a really long life laptop.  At the store they told me not to expect anything better than 8 hours.  And if you are not connected to wifi like I was not at a cabin for 2 weeks you can't even set the time, there is no function to do that.  I mean really...  and if you want to archive a book you can't because that is only an on-line function.  Any files you add can only be deleted when connected to a laptop.  In bright sunlight it is barely visible unless you find some shade.  If you are not connected to wifi and your book expires, then the little book icon gives you a message that says ""The content is no longer available"".  What that content is remains a mystery to me and you cannot fix the error until you connect to wifi, after which it miraculously fixes itself.All in all this may be usable like a really slow laptop around the house, but for traveling its not worth lugging around.  Really, why even use it around the house when I have a fast laptop already that does a lot more.  This thing is just not ready for prime time, paper books beat it hands down.

Decided I wanted a bigger screen and color. Had a difficult time at the outset w/ B&N; who overcharged my credit card. Got that fixed. Got the Nook and immediately loved it. But the color turned out to be not that thrilling and I would forgo that now. I'm not reading little kids' books. Then, my email quit working about a month later. They fixed it over the phone once, but it didn't stay fixed. Now the power cord has a break in it, a wire showing and cannot fix it with electrical tape. Naturally, their cords are proprietary. So, buying another.I don't NEED more email sources: have a computer, a smart phone, and an iPod Touch. But it's on the NookColor, so it turned out to be handy, until it quit. And the power cord: reinforce yours as soon as you get it. I am probably hard on it, reading while the power cord is powering the device, and bending it in ways it probably should not be bent, but it's still disappointing for nearly $250 and after only a month of use. Took me a year to bend my Mac's power cord to the point of no repair.It's not perfectly weighed and tends to flop over when holding it from the bottom.I probably would not buy it again. I'd buy Sony instead. I have an older Sony and I think their quality is better. And they have a better selection of sic fi in their Reader's Store.

Turning pages is easy with a light touch on the side of the screen or a press of the page button in the sideframe.The battery took a couple of full charge/discharge cycles to stabilize. At that point, it was using about 2% of the battery for each hour or two of reading.  Reading an hour or two hours a day and using the Wi-Fi an hour or two per week would result in 3 weeks or 4 weeks per charge.

The only problem?... THEY BREAK EASILY!I've bought two Nooks in the past year and a half. The first one the simple touch e-reader, the second the simple touch e-reader with glow. Both of them broke within a few months of use. The first one I considered to be my fault, the second one fell and although the drop was only two and a half feet, and the nook had a case (bought from Barnes and Noble for the Nook), the screen now no longer works. The image it projects looks like shattered glass with parts of the screen changing and the rest stuck in the same image as it was when it fell.I told a coworker about it that day when she asked me where's my nook, since I always have it with me for breaks. She found it funny mine had broken so easily, and then gushed that her Pantech(a much cheaper e-reader from walmart) had survived falling off a second floor patio.I wouldn't be as mad, but when I called customer service they said they couldn't do anything because the problem hadn't been ""internal"". I asked to speak to the supervisor, who gave me the same song and dance as the customer rep before had done. I asked him to total up how much money I've spent on e-books in the last year and a half. It totaled up to 600 dollars. I spent about 190 or so on the simple touch since I had gotten a case and some other stuff with it. The simple touch with glow I got when first came out at 160 ordering from barnesandnoble.com. That's 960 dollars I've spent in a year and a half on books, and their customer service didn't even bother offering me a replacement or even as much as a discount on getting a new e-reader.I'm an avid reader and love reading in my free time, or whenever I have to wait for something. I would assume most people buying an e-reader would want to take theirs with them outside of the house. I try to take real good care of my things, but sometimes things drop. They should be able to withstand a little wear and tear without breaking.

Hardware and software wise, the product itself is perfect as a functional and easy to use e-Reader.However, when I started to look for books to purchase (they were about investing if you were curious), out of the five books I tried to find, I ended up only being able to find one of the books I wanted. I purchased this device having read half a dozen reviews, and the reviewers all commented on how comparable the book selections for Amazon and Barnes and Noble are, but the truth is, B&N; still has a ways to go.I am aware the the Nook supports e-pub which allows it to read generic pdf files (something that the Kindle can't do), but one of the features I look for in e-readers is convenience. Having to buy a book from Google books on my laptop and then transferring it to my Nook is not convenient.

It's more convenient, however, because the pages don't turn of their own accord when it is set down, and it is lighter than a book. In addition, though many ebooks are sold at the same list price as the book itself, the Barnes & Noble site allows users to download many free ebooks in addition to buying. This is a space-efficient way for those who read many books to own books; it is not necessary to have walls of bookshelves, because the Nook holds many digital versions of the same books which one could buy in a physical form.

The default software is not compatible with many would-be useful formats such as txt or rtf. There is no folder view for displaying the books you put on it, you are constrained to a library view that tries to sort everything for you. The settings page is a joke, there is almost no customization to be had there. The shop's main view was nonfunctional out of the box; every time I tried to access it, it kicked me back out to the main page, and I had to access it by going to the ""top 100"" page instead, and even then the search would sometimes not work.

Turns out I made a great decision! I used to be a strict physical book junkie, but now I enjoy reading both my nook and regular books.  The thing that gets me is that I can bring it practically EVERYWHERE (in the car, doctor's office) rather than bringing my huge hardcover books.  It's really a wonderful product.Here's some highlights that won me over (before and after):-After I charged my nook for the first time, the battery lasted about a month before dying, which is really great!-Light, nice grip to hold-LOVE the touch screen! When I'm at the gym I just tap on the screen and it's so much easier to read than holding pages on a real book (which I don't mind either)-Format of the books are awesome, I love how you can see the covers.-flashes EVERY SIX PAGES!! this feature made the biggest impact on my decision.  I absolutely hated how the kindle flashed on every page.  Huge turn-off for my reading experience.Things that aren't so good:-Touch screen freezes randomly (ie. when I accidently highlight something)...but it doesn't happen very often.  I'm not that upset because all I have to do is reboot it and then it works perfectly again.  I'm expecting the system updates will solve that in the near future. I'm pretty sure they are working on it right now!-ebooks are the same price (sometimes more) than a physical book.UPDATE (2/19/12)nook update fixed the freezing!! my nook has been performing beautifully since my purchase in august!! :) i am a happy reader! GET THIS INSTEAD OF THE KINDLE! my friend has the kindle touch and it's way too unorganized.  I love my nook because it still has buttons for those people who can't entirely adjust to an all touch screen device.  For some reason buttons make me feel very comfortable, but I do however use the touch screen every once in a while.  You don't get that luxury with the kindle! I LOVE MY NOOK! After playing around with my friend's kindle (she got it last month), it just reminded me that I made the right decision. yay nook!!some advice..-BUY A CASE OFF AMAZON! I got one for like 16 bucks and it's the best case I've ever had.-Purchase the nook in best buy. They have extended warranties and they are great on customer service. Or you don't have to. Your choice.So, all I have to say is... I LOVE MY NOOK! It makes me want to read more books because they're so accesible! At first, I was worried I wasted money, but this is truly a fine product.

A real home run?  Not quite...Quick summary is that they won't sell me any other unit with an LCD (I spend all day looking at one of those, I don't want another one for my fun-reading).  I might as well use my netbook or go all the way to a real tablet, and that won't be from B+N.Here are the problems with the whole Nook thing.(1) You can't use it for a PDF, magazine, or anything with graphics because YOU CANNOT ZOOM OR ROTATE. I have purchased some books with pictures and figures that you can't see.  Guess they want you to get the color tablet-like Nook, huh?  Nope, not going there (see above).(2) YOU CANNOT SHARE BOOKS. Yeah, yeah, they SAY you can, but that's VERY LIMITED and makes no sense.  (If the publishers trust them enough with their DRM to have the book at all, why can't you transfer the book to someone else using the same DRM?) I can get a paperback, read it, and share it forever.  Not so with Nook and you know it.(3) B+N (and everybody's) E-BOOKS COST THE SAME AS A NEW PAPERBACK, even though the seller didn't incur any cost of printing, shipping, inventory, etc.  But I can get a paperback for 25% off at my local Kroger grocery store for new releases and best sellers, or I can go down to the used book stores and find quite a few titles at 50% (or more) off list.  When everybody in my family has read that book, I can sell it to the used book store for 15% or 25% of list value.  That's a win-win.So, where's the advantage with a Nook other than it's cool?  Three strikes (it could get one more if you count fragility compared to a paperback book).  This whole e-reader thing is bravo-sierra at this point.That's my $0.02.

Nook offers SIX Professional & Distinct Fonts: Caecilia, Malabar, Amasis, Gill Sans, Helvetica, & Trebuchet -- 3 are Serif -- 3 Sans Serif, they are all excellent choices for e-readers, & 3 of the fonts are exceptionally legible.  In unfortunate contrast, Kindle offers a generic Serif, a generic Sans Serif, & something they call ""Condensed"".Nook's screen is crystal clear & glare resistant; and their lovely fonts provide an elegant reading experience.I must confess to you, I found Nook's Font Superiority Compelling, and when combined with the fact that the device itself sports a superior, more elegant design, I truly wanted Nook to prevail in this contest.  But Alas, there was also a chink in Nook's fine suit of armor; nay, not a chink but a fatal missing piece . . .--------------------Advantage: KINDLE* Kindle's Annotations Feature is Vastly Superior over Nook's.  The Notes I make on my device instantly sync across my devices & my Laptop, and they are also backed up on Amazon's Website.  I thus have perfect access to my annotations on my PC, e.g.: to Cut & Paste into my word processor.In contrast, Nook's Annotation ""Feature"" is Abysmal:  The Notes I make on my Nook do Not sync to my PC (or vice versa), and thus there is NO WAY to copy them into my word processor(!), Nor are the Notes backed up.  This, my friend, is both ridiculous and a FATAL Flaw.  And this is the reason that the only time I use my Nook anymore is for those very rare times when there is an ebook available in epub format that is unavailable on Amazon.* Amazon offers a wondrous feature that makes the highlighting of my fellow-readers visible in my books.  You can toggle this feature on & off, and there is an Amazon site that lets you view readers' highlighting for ANY book--not just the books you own.  I have Greatly benefited from this feature because: 1. It has often cued me to helpful passages that I had not fully appreciated; and 2. Perusing other readers' highlighting helps me to assess whether those books would really be a good investment of my time & money.* Amazon has slightly better paid ebook coverage than does B&N;, and Kindle ebooks are often cheaper than Nook ebooks.* It is FAR more pleasant searching for books on Amazon than on B&N;, and Amazon offers Many more book reviews.  Amazon's website is so much better than B&N;'s that, during the period that I was so hoping that Nook would win, I would still search for the ebook on Amazon before buying it on B&N.;* When my Kindle is fully powered OFF, it starts up Instantly;  My Nook takes almost half a minute to boot up from Full Off.* I can read my Kindle books on my BlackBerry;  Barnes & Noble Used to support BlackBerry but recently chose to abandon us.* I have had the unfortunate experience of dealing with B&N;'s customer service.

So far it has been PERFECT!!! I am glad I chose it over the kindle. I have not had the screen freeze thing thats been happening. I see some people have had it though. But anyway the keyboard works well and is surprisingly responsive, the page turns are perfect (definitely faster than it would take you to turn the page in a real book) and the layout is beautiful and clean and also simple to navigate. Im still finding new things that my nook simple touch can do! The Barnes and noble store built into the nook simple touch is pretty good, and should suit the full needs of most people. The memory is great with 236 mb of internal memory and the ability to upgrade to atleast 16 gigs maybe even 32 gigs im not sure of that though. But trust me I have 145 full books(and a few wallpapers) on my nook and I havent even gotten through  half of the 236mb internal memory let alone the 4 gig micro-sd card I bought for it so dont let the small memory size fool you as book files are TINY! The nook does exactly what its designed to do, (which is be an ereader), perfectly! The browser is pointless and has been removed with the most recent update but trust me, you arent going to miss the browser as it was slow and annoying anyway. If you are looking for an ereader with a great browser, mp3 and mp4 capabilities,than the nook Simple Touch is NOT for you (get the nook Color or Nook Tablet). If you want a great ereader with no real flaws, the latest in ereader technology, an extraordinary battery life, and an easy to use interface than this is the ereader to get.I was stuck between the kindle touch and a nook simple touch but I chose the nook because it displays books better (has pictures and the actual book covers instead of just the title in words) and the Touch screen is a lot more responsive on the Nook Simple Touch than on the kindle touch. Also the buttons on the side that can be used to turn the page (if you dont wanna touch the screen) on the Nook Simple Touch are great and come in handy! And personally the nook simple touch just FEELS better as in the navigation is faster and more smooth than the kindle touch which seemed to take longer and be a lot more ""Blinky"" on the kindle touch. I felt a greater delay between me touching the screen and the Kindle reacting than with the Nook Simple Touch. The only downside is that the B&N; bookstore is not as large as Amazons (its huge, but Amazons is immense), but even so I have still been able to find all the books by my favorite authors on the B&N; bookstore.Pros:-Great, clear screen trhat allows you to read for hours-Very responsive touchscreen and touch keyboard (you will be pleasently surprised!)-Great battery life (Literally can go 1 to 1 1/2 month without charging with wifi off and leaving it in ""sleep"" mode as far as I have seen with mine)-Easy to use with a simple, efficient, elegant design-The ability to upgrade the memory to a larger size-Tons of options and ways to change the fonts, text size, highlight, write notes, look up words, layout settings, and other customizations to make reading easier for YOU!-Light, small design with a rubber gripped back so it is portable and wont slip from your hands-Supports basically all the major types of book file types like EPUB (which the kindle doesnt)-Elegant cosmetic design that doesnt look cheap and flimsy like most other ereadersCons:-B&N; bookstore is not as great as Amazons-May freeze occasionally when you turn it all the way off (this has never happened to mine though, but I've seen it mentioned quite a few times but seems to be easily fixable with no permanent damage)-Wish it had a built in backlight (the new nook simple touch does) but Im not buying a newer more expensive nook just for a backlight!!!

While there were things about the Kindle I really liked (features that other reviewers on the Kindle site had written), the one thing that made me choose the Nook was the ability to borrow and read ebooks from my local library. Haven't been back to the library since!Now here comes the Nook Simple Touch Reader (Nook STR). I got one via pre-order when they came out in early June.  It has the same e-ink Pearl screen as the Kindle, so the screen contrast is no longer an issue. And wow, has the user interface improved over the original Nook! (which I thought was clunky) The entire e-ink Pearl screen has full touchscreen capability. On both the Kindle and the original Nook, I felt myself wanting to touch the screen to select a book to read, instead of using the buttons (on the Kindle) or the LCD touchscreen (on the original Nook) to highlight and select the desired ebook. On the Nook STR, the Library screen shows icons for all the ebooks loaded in the device (both library and purchased). Touch the icon, and the ebook opens. Turning the page? Touch the screen on the right side of the page (to go forward) or the left side (to go back). Or swipe your finger across the screen as in flipping a physical book page. Or use the buttons built into the frame. Want to page quickly through a book? Hold down the page turning button. Need a word definition? Touch and hold on the word and a dictionary pops up. The user interface resembles that of an iPhone or iPad, with the icons, virtual keyboard and the physical home button. It even has the ""slide to unlock"" feature like the iPhone. The touchscreen on the Nook STR is infrared (it senses the heat of your finger, again like iPhone), so a light touch works just fine. I found that on the original Nook, sometimes it would take multiple touches on the LCD screen for the device to recognize a command.In response to the reviews about the touchscreen ceasing to respond, the pre-order Nook STR I had suffered from that problem.  The touchscreen would become slow to respond, and eventually quit working altogether.  A power cycle generally brought it back.  I started a thread on B&N;'s website about this and found many others having the problem.  I did take my Nook STR back to B&N; and they exchanged it.  Have had the replacement Nook ST for six weeks now and the problem hasn't returned.  So don't be spooked about buying one due to this problem - if it happens to you, exchange it.Going back to library books, I had to install Adobe Digital Editions onto my PC (my library had the link to download - free).  This software allows you to manage your ebooks on your Nook.The Nook STR is a good choice for seniors that may not have extensive computer skills.  Using the device is easy enough, but loading books from a library website (via Adobe Digital Editions) requires a few steps to complete.  If help is needed, it can be a positive relationship-building experience.One last plus - once you get your Nook STR, check the ""Shop"" tab to access B&Ns; website.  Every Friday B&N; offers a free book for download, and has discounts on other days of the week.",5.0,Simple (To Use) Touch Reader,1311465600,"07 24, 2011",Electronics,1.0

I unexpectedly found this Nook at Walmart and it saved me a trip to the local Barnes & Noble store when I was in a hurry. However I love going to the Barnes & Noble store because if you take your Nook, you are able to read any Nook book for free for up to 1 hour per day without purchasing it. I don't think any other ereader brand has that advantage.I have had a good experience with my Nook Touch and I have had no technical problems except for one time. The screensaver froze the first day I put the leather cover on.  I simply powered it off and on. After that, I have not had any problems. At work, I frequently leave it on the screen saver for hours and when I return to it to read, it gives me no problems.- Touch screen - The touch screen is always responsive using the menu and also when selecting a book and turning the pages in a book. I like that I still have the option to NOT use the touch screen for turning the pages in a book and being able to use the page-turn buttons instead. Sometimes while reading a book I will accidently touch the screen and the menu will pop up or the page will turn. Since there are page-turn buttons, it would be helpful if the Nook had a feature to temporarily disable the touch screen. However, that defeats the whole purpose of a touch screen ereader, lol.  Okay, I have read about people having a problem with their screen ghosting; in my case I have not come across that on my device.- Dictionary - The dictionary is Merriam - Webster's Collegiate dictionary.  Looking up a word in the dictionary can be accessed only through the touch screen and it is always responsive, BUT it might be frustrating for someone with big fingers because touching the screen and highlighting the intended word to look up might result with the device highlighting the word above or below it. It all depends on the SIZE of the text on your screen though. The smaller the text, the easier it is to highlight the wrong word by accident. I have small hands and fingers so I have hardly had a problem with that.- Ebooks(Nook books) - Purchasing books directly on this device is a no-brainer and I turn on wi-fi only when I am going to download a book on it. It is also a breeze to download books directly on the B&N; website through the computer. Before I ever purchased this device, I researched and found out there were several books I was interested in that were Nook books and my primary intention of getting ebooks on this device was by purchasing directly from B&N.; I do not yet have any experience putting ebooks from a third party on this device and I have not inserted an SD card either so I cannot comment on that.- Battery Life - The battery life is EXCELLENT. I always have the wi-fi turned off to conserve battery life and I will only turn it on for searching and downloading a book from B&N.;This ereader is everything I expected. I wanted to be a bigger nerd than I already am and I simply wanted this to read, read, and read more. I LOVE that I can always carry this in my purse and read anywhere!...at work, while waiting at a doctors office, waiting for my car to be serviced, at the red lights OR while driving!....lol. jk.Since I only wanted this to read, I did NOT want much features on this device so that I would not get distracted from reading. Perhaps some other ereaders on the market have other features such as a music player(I have my mp3 player for that), text- to-speech(I'm not blind), web browser(I have my laptop for that), and social networking access(I don't do any social networking but I read that this device has limited access to log into facebook & twitter and connect with other NOOK users). Anyway, I am satisfied none of those features are on this device.All in all, I am very satisfied with this little ereader.********UPDATE 4/14/12**********Everything is still pleasant with my Nook Simple Touch ereader. However, Barnes & Noble is releasing the NEW ""Nook Simple Touch with Glowlight"" in May.

If you are looking for an all purpose ePad or IPAD alternative, buy another product!  That's clearly not what Barnes and Noble designed this unit for.  It's not intended to surf the web, check email, etc.  It is an eReader...PERIOD!Having said that, in my opinion, it is the best out there right now.  It is incredibly light weight - much lighter than even a typical paperback.  It is easy on the eyes for extended reading periods and can be read in basically every lighting situation you could read a real book.  The clarity is sharp but not overpowering on the eyes like an LCD type display is after a few hours.The battery life is insane.  If you turn off WIFI, which should be normal unless you are looking for another book, the battery doesn't need recharging for weeks on end.  Page turning is a simple touch to the left or right of the screen.  Assignable buttons are also provided for pagination but they require a rather firm press.  I found most of the time I don't use them.It has a very responsive touch screen for all your navigation.  I had a 1st generation Nook and this one is far easier to navigate through books which is a big plus for Bibles or Reference books.  It reads ePub format so more than half of what I read comes from the public library.It is not going to be great for color magazines and so on.  You will need a Nook Color or an ePad like Xoom or IPAD for that.  But the downside with those is that the LCD type display cannot be read in direct sunlight so good luck at the beach or pool.One nice feature I use now and then is the dictionary.

I love the idea of a simple, cheap(er), E ink, midsize book reader and it seemed to fit the bill as I tried it out. After using it for a few months, I realize that its not yet the device I was hoping for.Good:- My setup was pretty simple- Nice form factor- Battery life- Book display looks goodBad:- In-store help was not that great. My nook was one that broke a few months after light use, so I took it back to the store. The thing was completely broken, but it still took 1 1/2 hours. At the end of this time, with the in-store employee having to talk to several different people on the phone for approval and getting ideas for possible fixes and being confused by those fixes, they finally said that I could send it in and get a new one in a few weeks. That was odd because they had just told another customer that in-store help was so much better than working with Amazon. After another phone call and manager approval, who also felt it important to play with the device, I did finally walk out with a new one.- Holding the device is strange for me. I can't get a comfortable grip that also works for turning the pages. Not sure if this is the size or the fact that I have to be careful not to touch the screen the whole time I'm reading. I just know that there is a subtle feeling that holding a real book feels better than this device.- Cover looks good, but only hooks in on one side, even though the device has places on both sides where it could connect. Not sure why they did this, but the problem it causes is that when you use the buttons on the left to turn pages, the right comes up off the back an inch or so. This means the thing flaps every time you turn the page this way.- Syncing to the latest page read does not work between NOOK for PC and the reader. When I e-mailed them, they gave a generic response that they are working on it and to check back with their website, which already said that it was supposed to work.- Gave up on getting library e-books after installing a couple of applications on my computer, several e-mails to libraries, and discussions with others that got it working, but said it was a pain. Could be a problem just with my area.- Free books I tried are terrible. I had a hard time finding a decent one (the one I got  through google books were unreadable), so paid for a cheap version, which still had problems.- Physical page turning using the buttons on the left and right of the device is strange. The buttons require you to either press in just the right place, or press too hard, so there is always a pause to see if it did turn, or if I should hit it again.- The realization that I have to pick sides early in the Amazon vs. B&N; battle since the books I'm buying may not work on the devices of the future, and for the short term, they definitely will not work. For example, I was considering the Fire, but know that the dozen books I bought so far for the Nook will not transfer over easily if I do.Overall I like it, but hopefully the next version, or the next Kindle, will solve some of these problems.

It claims to have support for common image formats such as jpg and bmp but in actuality it does not. The only way it can display an image is through its screen saver which would be ok except the screen saver can not be cycled and pops up a random picture from a folder so there is no way to view a specific file.  If you try to access any images from a folder it will give you an error saying &#34;this nook cannot read this file.  It may be an unsupported format.&#34; I have tried both bmp and jpg formats from different sources and received the same error even though the screen saver can read and display the very same files.It also claims to support PDF files which it sort of displays but it will not let you zoom in on a pdf. The reader also can not be put into  landscape mode which makes the text of most pdfs so small they are impossible to read.  Also when showing a pdf they aren't even expanded to take up the full screen making it even harder to read them.Barns and noble &#34;leaked&#34; the fact that there is a hidden browser built into the nook but this browser is so buggy that you cant even do a simple google search on it. The browser is so useless that it would have been better to not include it at all so you could have a bit more storage space which brings me to my next point.  Out of the 2 GB on board memory you are only able to access and store 250 MB of info.Another disappointing aspect of the device is its battery life.  The Battery although fairly good at 1 month is much shorter then the 2 months stated for the device.  Had the appropriate 1 month battery life been stated i wouldn't have a problem with this but stating it lasts 2 months on a single charge is a drastic over statement of its capability's especially when it would drain in under this time just siting in standby.The reader only has two things going for it.  First it has an micro SD memory card slot which is necessary sense it has so little space for storage and this device can be rooted (which will void your warranty). Once you root it software can be installed which allows you to over come most of the devices shortcomings but rooting it voids your warranty and is in no way officially supported.  Rooting can be a long task if your not use to android terminology although if your already familiar with developing on android its a pretty simple process.  Rooting also drastically reduces battery life dropping it from approximately 1 month battery life to 3 days or so with the standard android install but this can be brought back up to 1-2 weeks battery life by modifying a few of the system files.,1.0,Horrible Software Good Hardware,1398643200,"04 28, 2014",Electronics,0.0

Dont move an ebook, instead copy the ebook on the ereader & retain  the original download on computer hard drive because you might want to read it again in 10 years.MY NOOKi like MY nook because it is light wieght and the batteries last 1 month between recharges and it holds 500 books and has a slot to accept up to 32 gb flash drive memory, just in case i want my nook to hold 1000 books, and nook has a really bright white screen ,like expensive ink jet paper.If you leave wi fi &#34;on&#34;,nook battery only last 2 weeks between recharge, with wi fi off ,battery last 4 weeks.My sony prs 300 ereader screen looks kinda grayish in compairson to nook, but only when they are side by side,my sony ereader screen looks just fine by itself .My sony ereader -prs 300-is less than 1/2 price of nook, but has no wi-fi & only holds 9 books but allows you to delete books one at a time or 4 at once, so you always can make room for 3 or 4 new books. sony's battery needs recharge thru usb cord every 2 weeks.but the sony can change from portriat to landscape orentation, so i can hold my sony ereader sideways, when i read in bed,on my back  with the ereader held up over my head. My nook cant do this.sony prs300 works with .epub & .pdf & sony reader software that you download onto your computer. the email address for sony reader is inside sony ereader. sony reader for your computer is a epub & pdf reader 4 your computer that lets you download free internet books and copy them to the sony reader library ,where you can read the ebook on your computer and also sideload  a copy of the ebook,through the ubs2 cable  into your sony ereader - prs300the sony reader reconizes the sony ereader-prs 300 and allows sideloads.nook wieghts 6 oz and sony wieghts 8 oz, so not much difference in wieght.And nook has wi - fi ,in-case i want to pay $12.00 for a book instead of downloading the book for free on to my computer.There might just be a situation where i cant get to my computer to get a free book and i was so bored that i was willing to pay for a wi-fi book, but i dont think so. the filthy rich would like the wi fi 12.99 book ,though.I thought that the nook touch screen would be cool , but it is kind of a pain the the butt because the nook changes pages when ever your finger gets even close to the screen, weather you want to change pages or not. 'So,you spend 30 % of you time ,just trying to find the page you were just on, 2 seconds ago.But,after a while,you get used to this and its not really an issue,even though it continues to occur.It's the price you pay for a touch screen.the nook works with .epub and .pfd books and adobe digital editions. You should downloadadobe digital editions from downloads/cnet.com  for free onto your computer and then download free internet books into your computer file that the internet puts them in and copy the file into adobe digital editions library. adobe lets you look at/read-- the book on your computer and see if you want to sideload it into your nook. adobe digital editions will recon-nize your nook when you plug in the usb cord and has a drop down menu button that says copy ebook to nook.SIDELOAD means plug usb2 cable that comes with nook into computer and into nook. this cable recharges the nook battery and at the same time allows you to download .epub and .pdf ebooks & files into you nook.WHAT I REALLY HATE ABOUT THE NOOK  is you cant delete just 1 book or just 20 books,you have no choice,you must delete all the books on the nook.Because of this,backup on to your computer any book you download into nook, as you cant retrieve anything from nook. You must delete every thing all at once and start from empty all over again.A very bad feature nook should change as soon as possible.The saving grace is the large 500 book capacity of the nook and the slot to install a 32 gb flash drive memory stick so that nook can hold 1000 books. You wont have to delete it all and start over for a long time .nook requires you go to barnes & noble to open an account & register the nook before nook will work. The B&N; salespeople will do it 4 you, or you can do it yourself,if you like to read & follow instructions. When you delete nook , you have to reregister nook at barnes & noble all over again.most people will be out of range of B&N; wi-fi ,so you wont be able to register nook without a trip to B&N; to get in range of the wi fi.",4.0,"my nook ,a love/hate thing,compair nook to sony ereader as i own both.",1388448000,"12 31, 2013",Electronics,1.0

This device fills a niche- if you want to annotate pdf documents or watch movies or any of those other things, get a tablet or the iPad or the kindle fire. This device is designed to read books, and it does a beautiful job at it. I purchased my Sony reader expecting to be able to add comments in it, but it was way too difficult, and ultimately I decided to purchase an iPad. Like the Sony reader, the nook can take notes but wouldn't be a great device to purchase for that purpose.It was pretty easy to set up- I didn't read the instruction manual, but I usually don't. I just followed the on screen instructions to connect it with my internet, my barnes and noble account, and then plugged it into my computer to sync it with library books. I had a bit of trouble connecting it with my internet, but that has happened with every new device I've purchased, so I think its my internet's fault, not the nook. I went through the steps a few times and then it started worked.I really like holding it to read- I generally read ridiculously thick books, so its nice to have something small and light to hold instead of a massive book that I have to prop up (and its so much nicer to read from than an iPad- the iPad is fine to read from, and i never seemed to feel screen fatigue, but it is way too heavy to hold with one hand). Initially I didn't realize that the two buttons on either side of the screen move the page forward or back, so I was touching the screen each time- the delay time is a bit longer that way, and it was annoying to have to use both hands. As soon as I realized that the buttons existed, the experience got even better.The battery life seems great- I charged it all the way up using my usb-to-outlet power adapter that I have for my iphone/ipad, and it worked great. I haven't had to charge it again, and I've been reading for about an hour each day.The one thing that surprised me and was frustrating for a few minutes was when I realized that I couldn't load my other epub books onto the nook because there wasn't enough room. The advertised size of the nook is 2gb, which is a ton of books, but it wasn't enough room for the books I've acquired through other sources- like google book downloads. A quick google search solved this problem- barnes and noble appropriates the majority of this space for content you purchase directly from barnes and noble. Fortunately there is an easy solution- there is a slot for a microSD card, and I happened to have a 2gb one lying around- plus they only cost about $5, if that. I popped it in, turned the device off and on, and I was ready to go again. Not a deal-killer by any means, but something to consider if you're planning to add your own epub library to your nook.Kindle vs. Nook- I haven't owned a kindle, only used it for a few minutes, but my personal opinion as I decided which to purchase was this: price was important (and I got a great black friday deal on the nook), and since they were about the same price I wanted to support the more open epub format, since you can load books from other sources. Yes, its possible to convert epub to kindle format but its an extra step that many people won't be interested in. I would have purchased the kindle with special offers, and hadn't thought much about it, but I've enjoyed the pictures of authors that show up on my nook screen, and would probably get annoyed by the commercials/make a point to put my nook in a case so I didn't have to see them.Durability- I haven't abused it by any stretch of the imagination- yet- but it did take a fall off a coffee table and didn't crack/break/show any sort of damageI'll update my review as I have more time to play with it in the next few months",5.0,Great purchase- you won't regret it,1323388800,"12 9, 2011",Electronics,1.0

For the first couple months it worked great and we loved it. Eventually we purchased a Kindle too so we could each have an e-reader.However, the Nook Simple Touch slowly began to start freezing, requiring a restart every single time. Because we like the device, I have tried researching everything online to see how to keep it from freezing (carefully dusting it off, charging it, reseting it, etc.) Sitting down to read is hard enough to do at times (am I right?), so I don't need my e-reader to freeze on me when I finally make the time to sit down and read. Based on my research, many others have the same problem with this model. In fact, many people had the same problem with the previous model. They have exchanged theirs at Barnes & Noble, only to report a couple weeks later that their replacement does the same thing!!!  Hmm, I wonder if the new generation of the Nook Touch is going to have freezing problems too???I have been in conversation with Barnes & Noble management (""object key"": 28817953) and they have refused to offer a valid solution to my problem.In short, don't purchase a Nook, they freeze all the time.

This thing is brilliant at what it does: displays ebooks.  No frills, no apps, no video, no nonsense.  Because of this it makes it very easy to use.  Download Calibre for free and this baby syncs right up with it.  Battery lasts forever, and it has the same charger as most android smart phones, so In the mornings I take my smartphone off its charger and replace it with my little nook.  I am in the military and as someone else said, this fits perfect in the side cargo pocket of my ABU's.  I had the Kobo, which was a great reader, and my wife had the last nook which I didn't like because it was so damn heavy.  I bought this for me so I could give my Kobo to my little girl.  I was able to snag one used on here from a seller named NikonLover for $47!  This thing is really great.  The only complaint I can make is that the page buttons are a little too recessed, but this is not a huge issue as I turn the pages mostly via touchscreen anyways.  Using this little beauty, and loading all of my own books, and PDF's that I have converted via Calibre, makes me beg the question: Why are people still buying Kindles?

It's just about the only time I've discovered something not by hype or searching for a product to fit my needs but by wandering upon it in an electronics store. After reading about the new reader for a few weeks, I decided to actually buy one.At this point, I've found it to be a really excellent device and the only thing remotely ""tablet"" that's appealed to my needs. I find it easy to use with one of the first touch screen keyboards that recognizes my non-dainty mitts (I kind of hate touch screens as a rule).

I just want electronic paper... for reading.Some bullet points about this e-reader, some of which stand it apart from competitors like the current Kindle:* 215 grams* No physical keyboard and low affinity of touch screen to oil* Battery life (obviously) - leave the wi-fi off* Maps true page numbers to print equivalent, should you cite or alternate between print and e-book* Supports non-proprietary formats that can be downloaded from Project Gutenberg, torrent sites, etc.* E-book library lendingIt's one of the last things I mentioned, but the high compatibility of formats on the Nook is absolutely indispensable to me.

The page turn buttons were terrible. My thumbs were getting sore waaaay too quickly when these buttons were supposedly designed for this use. I probably could have put up with everything else, but that was too big of an issue to me.The built-in interface was annoying and simplistic, but not the end of the world. You had advertisements for books you don't care about and you can't get rid of their default books. And there was no way to easily browse something like Project Gutenberg to get free books. The ghosting was annoying at times, but wasn't egregious. But I did notice it. The main thing it did was make the text the slightest bit blurry at times (i.e., not crisp). Made me feel like I needed my glasses (which I don't need for reading).I was shocked that there was no browser or email client. I'm not expecting an iPad, but the Kindle lets you at least browse the web. Yes, you could access a browser sort of, but it would randomly kick you out of wherever you were at and send you back to the search feature.For those looking to root it:It wasn't terribly difficult to root, but for me it really wasn't worth it. Things just don't work that well. You can probably make things work, but for me, it would have required a significantly higher time investment to get things acceptable than I was willing to give it. For instance: Text on web sites was often not sharp and difficult to read, images looked bad, and the inability (that I could find) to remap the primary buttons to quit going back to the stupid B&N; interface made it difficult to navigate. Additionally, ""search"" in the app store didn't work, and on some menus of the the OS the text was not visible at all (you had to guess what the icon was referring to and hope it wasn't anything bad).Over all, it was simply disappointing.

Buying a cover and quality book light completes the package giving you the feel of a real book without the weight and the ability to read in bed at night ;) You can shop over a wifi network directly from your nook, while in Barnes and Noble read any nook book for free as long as you are there and connected to their wifi network, and you can even add your favorite social networks to share things with your friends. All purchase books are your forever compared to other ebook services who may take the boom away when the publisher ends digital publishing. If you're looking for something simple without bells and whistles and are a true book lover, you will love this nook. Great for any age too! (Font sizes are adjustable.

I quickly tore into the packaging like a ten year old at Christmas and plugged the device into my computer.  I then attempted to closely follow the ""quick start"" instruction, but accidentally brushed through step 7 more quickly than I could read step 2...  Super easy set up!  I did run into one little hiccup when the screen when completely blank for a while and I thought I had prematurely ended it's existence...  Turns out it just didn't want to display anything while it had a discussion with the internet and I've come to expect this occasionally when accessing the internet, but it is usually very quick and never affects my reading.Next, it was time to download my first book.  I already had a book in mind so I went to the ""shop"" icon and typed the book's name into the search bar.  The book I was searching for appeared instantly atop of several other ridiculous options.  I selected the book and in a couple touches it was downloading.  It downloaded quickly, but when I went to open the book I ran into some trouble.  The Nook was asking for confirmation via my credit card number!  OK, so I put the card number in.  Rejected, try again (or something to that effect).  After about ten tries, I calmly put the Nook down and asked Google for help.  I was directed to a help forum where many people were having this problem and there were plenty of possible solutions.  I tried some of them and after about half an hour I was finally able to open my book.  I still have no idea what caused this problem or what I did to fix it if anything, but I haven't had this particular problem since.The reading experience was everything I had hoped it would be!  The letters stood out even more clearly than in most printed books and I was easily able to increase the text size just a touch to fit my preferred reading distance.  I have no trouble reading for extended periods of time as I have had with backlit e-readers which hurt my eyes after a while.  The options to change the font and size make it easy to find my spot quickly if I get distracted.After a couple of days I decided I wanted a break from my very long book and thought I'd try a magazine or newspaper.  I had trouble finding one that I really wanted to read.  The selection seems awfully short and does not seem to match up to the selection the website provides.  There is a nifty little 14 day free trial that I like a lot.  I chose a magazine that I had never heard of but sounded interesting.  It turned out to be Socialist-Extremist psycho babble.  After reading several articles I got to my Mac and cancelled my subscription.  I do not hold B&N; accountable for the content of this magazine, but I rated it as 1 star and unsubscribed and they still recommend other like minded subscriptions to me even though I've gotten other magazines and newspapers that I actually like since.  I have determined that they do not do a very good job of making recommendations.  Also, if you want to read more about the publication or customer reviews, you must go online to do it - it can not be done from the Nook.  After canceling my subscription I decided to read the reviews of that magazine and would never have chosen it had I read them first.  Thank goodness for that 14 day free trial!I also decided to subscribe to another magazine that I found in the ""My Nook"" online account that I could not find in through actual Nook.  That subscription is showing up in my online library, but not on the Nook itself.  After another half hour of research, it appears that the Nook accounts do not sync very well and tons of people are having this problem. Learning point: never order something online in the ""My Nook - My Library"" and expect to actually read it.I also do not like the way that newspapers and magazines are presented.  It's very confusing how you have to go through the introduction to several articles before you can actually read any article.  I realize that this is much like seeing the cover of an actual printed publication, but I am not forced to read every intro before opening the cover of a magazine and when it changes sections it is easy to not realize that you are now back to a cover section and think you are going to get the entire article only to be cut off when you turn the page.  I have gotten used to this, but I still don't like it.  I also do not believe that this is Nook specific.  This appears to be the format for all e-readers, although I haven't tried it on all of them.Regardless of my complaints, I am actually very happy with the Nook Simple Touch itself.  The process at Barnsandnoble.com needs some massive improvement and I could not review the Nook without addressing these concerns.",3.0,Good but NEEDS improvement,1322265600,"11 26, 2011",Electronics,0.0

The Franklin eBookman had nice hardware but dreadful firmware with more bugs than you would find in a swamp in summer.  The Ectaco Jetbook Lite had a number of glitches in its firmware as well, plus an extremely user-unfriendly upgrade method.I did encounter one major problem with this Nook Simple Touch -- the life of a battery charge was nowhere near the several weeks promised (with wifi off).  Fortunately, however, I called B&N; Customer Service, and they advised me to install the latest firmware, V1.0.1, which addresses the power issue.The upgrade proceeded easily and without glitches, and it seems to have solved the problem; though I haven't put the duration of a battery charge to the full test yet, the charge indicator is holding at 100% after a full day, including more than an hour of reading.  That compares very favorably to the 83% discharge rate I had been experiencing in just three days using the old firmware.  I will report back if the battery problem returns.Otherwise I prefer the Nook Simple Touch's ergonomics to the comparable Kindle.  The Nook's front is all screen, with no unnecessary keyboard keys.  Virtual keyboard keys appear onscreen when you need to search for something.  The unit fits nicely in the back pocket of my jeans or shorts, and it's trim and lightweight.There are convenient page turning buttons flanking the screen, making for easy one-handed operation in a subway.  You have a choice of font styles and sizes, and the screen is easy to read even under bright sunlight.  You can touch any word onscreen to get a quick dictionary definition (provided, I found, that the word isn't hyphenated and run on two lines).I like the ease with which you can download titles from the public library (you download to Adobe Digital Reader, which your library provides free, and then transfer the Epub books to your Nook with the USB cable provided).  The program recognized my Nook without any glitches.I also like being able to read any book for an hour a day FREE at the nearby B&N; store.Newbies should note that, in their apparent effort to keep the NST instructions short and simple, B&N; left out a few useful ones.  Notably: to close one book (so you can open another), press the Nook button below the screen (the thing that looks like an upside-down U) and enter ""library.""  To lock the Nook immediately, without waiting for it to enter sleep mode, press the power button on the back briefly.  And to tell when the Nook has finished charging, wait for the little LED next to the USB input on the unit to turn from amber to green.So if you have been looking for an ebook reader offering great value and ergonomics, take a look at this Nook.  But make sure to upgrade to firmware V1.0.1 or higher!)UPDATE: Trust me to find the bugs in an ebook reader -- or perhaps they find me.  At any rate, I bought a copy of the American Heart Association Cookbook (7th Edition) and was dismayed to see some of the fractions describing quantities in recipes replaced by question marks!I emailed B&N; Customer Support, and they suggested that I try downloading the title again (which you do by archiving and unarchiving a title, whatever that means).  That didn't work, but I found that if I clicked the check box on the font selection screen marked ""Publisher's Default"" (or words to that effect), that seemed to solve the problem.  So if you're seeing question marks in any titles where numbers should be, try that solution!I sure love beta testing new products for these big companies -- NOT!",5.0,The Right Touch,1314489600,"08 28, 2011",Electronics,1.0

Thus it is not really a advantage.*Barnes & Noble actually has stores to go and ask questions*On the nook, you can change the wallpaper/screensaver.*You can do that ^ on the kindle but you have to hack it first.Although I do think that the Kindle IS a better device, it a lot more expensive if you want no ads.

All the books I buy are from Amazon, and so with the nook it won't sync those which is unfortunate.  But where it shines is when I refuse to buy a book because the publishers are being greedy (eg, Dance with Dragons by George RR Martin, game of thrones series...  The ebook costs more than a physical copy.  It even costs more than a physical copy translated into another language!  Give me a break!)  So anyway, when it comes down to piracy to keep the publishers in check - the nook is great.  You plug it into USB, it shows up as a drive on the computer.  You type in the name of a book into google and add ""epub download"" to the end, and somewhere on the first page of results is a working download (at least with every book I've had to try so far.)

I have an iPad but when I do read, sometimes staring at that screen for more than an hour can give me a headache.  It came down to this, the basic Kindle, and the new Kindle Paperwhite.  When I really thought about it, the Paperwhite was more than I really wanted to spend on something I would only use an hour or 2 a week.  I ultimately decided to get this because it could read epub files natively and didn't have to be converted to MOBI files which the Kindle uses.It wasn't quite as straight forward as I was expecting.  I initially thought it'd be like the iPad where you just drag the book into the Books section of iTunes and you're ready to go.  I dragged the books onto the Nook when it appeared on my desktop and nothing happened.  I found out you had to download ADE and set it up that way.  From there you have to add the books to ADE then add them to your Nook, not a huge deal, but a few extra steps compared to the iPad.I also noticed that scrolling between pages had a bit of delay compared to the iPad and that when you were trying to use the scroll bar to advance more than a few pages at a time, it wasn't the most accurate.  It also appears that page sync only works with content you purchase from them and not files you have already on your computer(I think the Kindle is the same way as well though).The reading experience is great though.  Its not too bright and easy on the eyes.  The Nook itself is pretty light so its not a hassle to hold it for awhile.  Library is also easy to scroll through once its on your device.Overall I am happy with it.  I mentioned its shortcomings, but they don't outweigh how easy it is to read and the overall reading experience.  From a reading standpoint I'd give it 5 stars, just some other things that popped up that aren't big deals, but noticable.  I'd recommend this to anyone like myself who doesn't do a ton of reading, but still wants a simple e-reader.  If you are a more serious reader, I'd probably spring for the Paperwhite.",3.0,"Not bad, not great, but satisfied",1350345600,"10 16, 2012",Electronics,0.0

(Or is it because I gave a bad review?)I have never in my life written a review for a product- good or bad (even though I do a large amount of shopping online), but my experience with my Nook Touch has upset me greatly, and I would like to warn others shopping for an e-reader to consider my experience beforehand so that they make a well informed decision. My complains are:- I experienced two major technical problems within 5 months of purchase.- Technical support was clueless as to how to fix them, and instead suggested resetting and/or replacing the entire unit.- The replacement experience has taken over two months and 3 lengthy phone calls to customer service, and yet I still don't have a replacement.When I was shopping for an e-reader this past summer, I originally was going to go with a Kindle since they have a better selection of cheap and/or free e-books, but at that time, only the Nook had Touch capabilities, which ultimately won me over.Everything was going great until the button for Settings no longer responded, which meant I could no longer turn on the wireless to download any other books. Technical Service had no idea how to fix it, so they walked me through resetting the entire device, deleting everything I already had on it. Then they suggested updating my software version to avoid problems in the future. Unfortunately, this completely crashed the Nook to the point that even the most drastic steps to do a full reset didn't work. They said that since it was under warranty they would ship me a replacement.It never came. I called back every 2-3 weeks for the past two months asking for an update. I got excuses like: they warehouse is busy, and you have to send yours back first (even though the standard protocol involves getting the new one before sending yours back).At this point, I don't even want it anymore. And even though the user manual says that you can get your money back if your device is found to be defective, I have been informed that this only happens if you return it during the first 14 days of ownership. Going as high up on the customer service ladder as possible, all they said is that I cannot get a refund, and a replacement should be coming 'soon.'When and if it comes, I probably won't open it. I don't want to be reminded of this experience every time I pick it up. I'm going to cut my losses, and go get myself a Kindle.

Here is my comparison.There are many things that I prefer on the Nook over the Kindle.- Nook has page scroll buttons so that I don't have to touch (and smudge-up) the screen each time I turn the page- Though both eReaders advertise a battery life of two months, Kindle's is based on 30 minutes of use per day; the Nook's is based on 1-hour of use. In other words, the Nook's battery life lasts TWICE AS LONG.- The layout of the device software on the Nook is more user-friendly with the Nook. For example, the Nook has a home-page and a very simple menu to orient yourself between different screens. Using the Kindle, on the other hand, I always felt slightly disoriented, though I am sure many Kindle-users would tell you otherwise.There are also several things I preferred on the Kindle over the Nook.- The casing of the Kindle is better and has a better feel. This was not a big deal for me because I have a skin for my Nook - one of the colored ones BN sells.- The Kindle Touch can come with 3G. There are two reasons I am really happy using a Nook, even though it doesn't have 3G. (1) I have wireless internet at my house. (2) Even if I didn't, I could still buy books for the Google eBookstore at Google Play using a computer with an internet conection.Other things to consider:- Will you be reading books or daily publications more? A daily publication requires a constant source to internet. A 3G network might be really important if you want the daily newspaper.- With the Nook, you are able to read books or documents in the epub or pdf format. This means that you can purchase books from BN, google, and many other internet bookstores (ie. More competition). With the Kindle, you will, almost definitely, only be purchasing products from Amazon. BN (Nook) book prices tend to be higher than Amazon (Kindle). Amazon (Kindle) book prices about the same as Google (Nook).In the end, I felt that the Nook Simple Touch was a better purchase and a better device that was more intuitive to use and had to be charged much less frequently.

I was very frustated trying to get the menu display to stay there8) it took me a few mins before I can get the menu to be stable, then change to a smaller size. The text now reads fine.

And the epub size is much larger than PDF size (i.e. I will have a lot less books on it).To me, this eBook is useless, so I am going to return it back today.And this is not due to (or lack of) my high tech proficiency (I develop firmware for ""firwmare operated"" gadgets by trade , really know how to use these ""Software/firmware"" operated gadgets quite well, have at least 5 GADGETS with very complicated functionalities at home, all of them require patient readings thru their thick manuals to operate / setup to my liking, no problem at all).I have written quite a lot of product reviews on Amazon, most of the gave good rating because these products are good.I feel really frustrated with this one, the first bad review I wrote.My older two eBook readers work right of the box.

It would freeze while reading a book, or browsing the B&N; store or wouldn't load up from the screen saver. The only way to reboot it was to plug it into the wall and it would reboot. My final straw was when I could no longer unplug my Nook due to it freezing. The second I unplugged it, it would freeze on me and I'd have to repeat the process of plugging it in and waiting for it to start up for me. I called the company, they arranged for me to pick up a new Nook at the closest store and I drove down to get my new Nook. Apparently, as you might have guessed, my Nook had a faulty battery. There was no hassle returning the Nook and the guy even let me test drive the new one before walking out of the store to make sure I was happy with it. The first thing I noticed besides the fact that it didn't immediately freeze up on me was the fact that the power button was secure and didn't jiggle at all.So since I've gone through two separate Nooks, the latest showing minimal signs of problem, I'd say this is a decent product. Maybe I just happened to get the lemon of the lot? I still enjoy reading from my nook. It's a light weight device and small enough that it fits in my purse with ease. The e-ink screen makes it easier to read for extended periods of time without having to take a break due to a headache. The long life battery (when not a dud) lasts long enough for my 20 hr flight and a week without needing to be charged or turned off. Since I've gotten the replacement Nook a month ago, I've only needed to plug it in once. I also like that when I take it outside to read, there is no glare on the screen. It really is as if you are reading a book, except less bulky. I like being able to highlight and make notes in the book, it makes going back for references much easier. With a book, I would take a strip of paper and put it between the two pages, to later go back and reread them to figure out why I put the paper there. Even though I had a less than ideal experience with being a Nook owner I do enjoy the device.

However the Nook excels in nearly every other way.1) Nook is sturdily reliable.  I have had no failures with it whatsoever, although I carry it everywhere and use it daily.  I do have it in a protective case, but I had my Kindle in a protective case and it kept breaking anyway.  POINT:  NOOK.2) Nook Simple touch is smaller and lighter than the equivalent Kindle e-reader.  Nevertheless, screen-size is ample.3) Nook is responsive and seems faster at turning pages than Kindle.4) Books download in a blink and are immediately available.  This too seems faster than with my Kindle.5) There are some things I could do with my Kindle that I can't do with my Nook Simple Touch, but I don't miss those things.  I needed a simple e-reader that just plain works and Nook Simple Touch satisfies that need in a very inexpensive way WITHOUT ADS.

Press lightly on the outside rim of the page to turn it either way, press buttons on either side to turn the page the same direction that you have been turning. Press near the top right corner to ""bookmark"" the page, press in the middle of the screen to open up a small main menu (from which you can access your homepage, your library, the shop, settings, etc), press and hold over a word to highlight, mark, or look it up. You can search through your books for a typed phrase or word (very handy when trying to find a certain passage for writing a paper, or in-class discussions!) It also locks the screen, to unlock you press the n button and then slide your finger across the screen.Price: I have hundreds of books (some of them impossible to find in a physical copy), and I've spent less than $10 total on books. Modern books cost less than a new physical copy, and there are amazing values of treasure trove books which only cost a dollar or two but house complete collections or hundreds of classics. Free books are not to be underestimated also! I've only found one or two which hadn't been scanned in properly.Screen: you can adjust font, font size, and other features. Screen saver is a woodcut-like image of a classic author (my favorites are the Bronte Sisters or Jules Verne) or you may choose instead to show a nature scene (black and white photograph). Since it's eInk, it really is like a printed page-- you need light to read it, but it doesn't stress out your eyes like a computer screen would.Service: I have never had a problem with my Nook, but if I did I can take it straight to the nearest Barnes and Noble to have it fixed. Also, I've heard that you get free coupons and even occasionally a free book when you enter B&N; -- haven't gotten to try that feature out yet, my campus bookstore isn't officially a real B&N;, but I'm looking forward to it.Wifi: the Nook doesn't generate its own hotspot, but considering that practically everywhere you're going to go is jumping on the wifi bandwagon you shouldn't need one. You only need the internet when shopping for new books. Once purchased I've yet to have a book that took even near 10 seconds to fully download -- and that includes a complete Shakespeare!It's thin, easy to carry-- mine's never gotten scratched in a light sleeve, and that's after carrying it around in both a purse and a big bookbag-- and generally wonderful. I looked at both Kindle and Nook, and I'm really glad I got my Nook.

There are many reviews on YouTube and other places that address that point.  The problem with the B&N; system is the fact that you must enter a 'default credit card' to be able to use or purchase any books.  If you were to buy this Nook for your young son or daughter, they would be able to purchase anything at the flick of a finger, and it would charge to your credit card 'for your convenience'.  Similarly, if anyone found your child's Nook, they too could purchase anything using your credit card information.I tried get creative and purchased a gift card for my child but although this can create a credit on the child's account, B&N; still requires a credit card to be on-file in order to 'unlock' the book.  By contrast, with the Kindle system, you simply buy a book through Amazon using any credit card (which does not have to stay active) and send it to an authorized device.  The Nook system, by comparison, is slow, clunky, and a massive security risk.If you setup the Nook and do not provide this credit card during setup, no books can be sent to the Nook wirelessly, they must be sync'ed with a cable tethered to a computer.  Since my 12 year-old daughter purchased this herself with her own money, I have no choice but to either tell her to eat the unit or use my credit card without any parental control.  Furthermore, it would appear that B&N; is entering into a contract with my minor daughter in this regard.  By opting out of this model, you are left with an utterly useless device.Why none of the other reviewers elaborate on this is beyond me.  I suppose if the device is owned by an adult this model would work, however if you are contemplating this as a gift for your child, I'd avoid any device related to B&N; altogether.I give them 2 starts for the hardware only but otherwise the device, in this case, is useless.  While you can delete your credit card from B&N;, the process is well hidden and you would need to add a card, order, download, sync, unlock, and then delete the card in order to get each purchase on the device.  Either that or hand your child your Visa and tell them to enjoy!  Now that's what I call convenience.",2.0,"The device is okay, but the book service is not",1326499200,"01 14, 2012",Electronics,0.0

Contrast on the display was a big problem for me, and I wasn't especially keen that the Kindle uses a proprietary book format that cannot be read on other e-readers. So, as long as I stuck buying books from Amazon for a Kindle, I was fine; the second I ever wanted to move to another device, I couldn't take my books. This didn't sit well with me.When Barnes and Noble dropped the price of the Nook Simple Touch to $99 I decided to take the plunge. (Note that as of this writing, Amazon still has not reflected the price drop.) The newer generation screen, while still not perfect, is far, far superior than earlier generations. Reading indoors no longer requires a spotlight on the e-reader to maintain legibility. Anyone who owns an iPad or other tablet knows how intuitive a touch interface can be, so I'm delighted to say that the navigation issues previously posed by the joystick on the older Kindle are resolved with the Nook's new touch interface.Amazon released their own Touch e-reader just recently. While it now brings the Kindle in line with the capabilities of the Nook, it still lags in one area: proprietary book format. The Nook and all other major e-readers use EPUB, a now-standard file format for e-books. Amazon for its own reasons chooses not to. What this means in practical terms is that you pretty much have to buy all of your books from Amazon - and forget about taking them with you if you ever decide another e-reader is the better platform for you.I refuse to be a party to that kind of lock-in, which is why I am very happy with my Nook Simple Touch.",5.0,A Very Pleasant Surprise,1321401600,"11 16, 2011",Electronics,1.0

As this could have been labeled as my fault, that I did not pay enough attention to the casing, I did not try to send it back. Plus, I had to take my card out from inside the device somehow. I decided to open the device and forget about warranty to be able to get the card out. I tried to align the casing of the card reader, but instead I managed to break it entirely. The small metal plates broke in one spot and I decided to peel it off completely. I was able to finally put the cover back on the whole device, but without damaging some places of the plastic cover.

Oh well.The Nook Simple Touch is a great e-reader. If you are looking for a tablet like device to surf the internet and check email, this is not the product for you. The e-ink screen is amazing. It looks like you are reading a physical book. I like that you can turn the page by pressing the buttons or touching the side of the screen. Either way will be useful depending on how you are holding the book. This is very simple, which I love. One night, I was lying down in bed and went to lay the Nook on it's side then immediately jerked it back up before the page orientation changed. Then I remembered that it won't do that; which makes this great for reading no matter what position you may be sitting or lying in.The Nook accepts epub books; which means that you can get books from a variety of stores, not just Barnes & Noble. I found that between the B&N; store and Google Books, you can get all of the classics for free. No reason to pay for one of those ever again. Download Adobe Digital Editions to put books on from other places; including borrowed books from the public library.The Nook doesn't handle pdf's well on its own, but there is a work around. Download Calibre, bring your pdf's into it and then convert them into epubs.

In the past month alone, I have made at least 12 purchases.  I was browsing around just now and decided to see what Amazon.com customers thought of my newest electronic device.  I was thrilled to see the high rating, but disappointed to see the price; $40.00 more than the thing costs at B/N since its release last month.  Amazon, you need to do better here!Now to the product - This is my first e-reader and I am certain that I went with the best product for me.  As someone who buys a lot of books from Amazon, I would have preferred to have bought the Kindle,especially since Amazon has more of the types of books I read and for much cheaper than B/N, but I just do not appreciate those tiny buttons on the device.  I absolutely LOVE my Nook Simple Touch, and I use it for several hours every day.  B/N has Free Fridays - when you can download a featured book for free -, book share -with contacts on your device and social networks, and free reading of selected books when you are in B/N.  My understanding is that I can go to local libraries and even borrow my books using my Nook; This may or may not be any special news.The touch screen is a bit sensitive on the device, so if you prefer not to use it, they are also tactile ""buttons"" that will allow you to change pages.  The home screen shows the book you are currently reading and the page number you are on - a few other books in your library, and some suggested readings.  You can create shelves that you name on which to house your books by categories. They do not look like physical shelves, rather they are just a grouping of books.Without going into more technical stuff that you can read online, I will say that if you are new to e-reading and you enjoy touch screens -  AND YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A PRODUCT THAT SIMPLY ALLOWS YOU TO READ - Do not hesitate to go into a B/N and try this out.  Some people buy this expecting it to browse the web (although it does have a hidden browser that the techies are working to hack) - Play their audio files, when there is not headphone jack (Techies have discovered that it DOES have built-in bluetooth, however), and folks buy this and complain that they do not like how it does not display their magazines in color.  It is not meant to do that - it is meant to be solely an enjoyable easy-to-use reading device that does not give you a whole lot of options to be distracted from the task at hand, READING!This is why I bought it - Eventually, I will get a nook color - or a Kindle *color* if they come out with one, but for now, I thoroughly  enjoy my Nook, which has encouraged me to slow down and spend so much more time in the peaceful, leisurely act of reading. In my excitement, I am reading like 8 different books at once.  That is the great joy of having an e-reader - speaking to those who are, just as I used to be, resistant to the e-reading craze - there is no more lugging around a bag filled with books, and when I get tired of reading one, another book is just a couple of swipes away. I am learning about how to get all sorts of books for free or low cost, as well as learning how to take advantage of conversion and e-book management tools such as Calibre.  I am having a blast with this thing!Yesterday, I received a nice leather case for it that I purchased off Ebay for a great price.

It is very easy to convert my Word documents to epub and sideload on to my Nook.  The ubiquituous epub standard has opened a world of reading possibilities for me.

Just drag and drop from the desktop to the Nook and I'm in business.4.  Touch screen.  Having a choice, I'd rather not have a physical keyboard.  The Nook's touch screen just WORKS.5.  Design.  I really like (a) the rubberized coating.  Easy to grip, feels good.  (b) the size.  Small, easy to carry around.  (c) the page buttons.

This E-reader is highly rated by Consumer Reports and other reviewers, but if you own one and upgraded to the 1.1.0 firmware (automatically by B&N; or manually) you may have lost your ability to connect via Wi-Fi in some Wi-Fi environments including in your own home.  Various contacts via on-line support chat, telephone support and visits to Barnes and Noble stores have yielded the following:  The people on the other end of the conversation basically have no knowlege of the problem and direct you through a series of needless exercises in hopes that something will work.  If you escalate, you will eventually get to B&N; personnel who will acknowledge the problem and proceed to give you a non-answer.  If you compare this experience to the recent Kindle Fire problems you find Amazon.com stating they have a problem, what they are doing to fix it and an estimate of when things will be better.  Recent announcements tell you that Amazon.com has followed through on this and that the first batch of fixes are already available.  Barnes and Noble, acting in a manner that is the reverse of Amazon.com, continues to let those with the Wi-Fi problem live with that problem.  While you will not find any reference to the problem on the B&N; site a Google search on ""Barnes and Noble Simple Touch W-Fi problems"" or a similar search, will give you a better feel for Simiple Touch owners who are struggling.  SOLUTIONS:  Drive to another location where Wi-Fi works (suggested by one B&N; person).  For PC owners with Internet access, you can still connect to B&N; from your PC, buy your E-product, download it and transfer it to your Simple Touch.  Your less technical friends and relatives or those who do not have a PC and rely on working wFi-Fi may not be so lucky.  Of course another solution would be to 1.Acknowledge the problem, 2.State and estimated date when a resolution may be available. 3.Fix the problem and announce the fix.  Amazon.com did this.  Why can't Barnes and Noble? Good luck to those without this problem.  You have a nice light, long battery life E-reader that works well in appropriate lighting.  The reading experience is quite nice.  And for 1.1.X, lets hope it doesn't introduce you to the Barnes and Noble problem resolution experience.2011-12-27: I continue to try to resolve this problem on my own and have so far determined that all other Wi-Fi devices (several) I own connect fine to my home network including a Nook Color (strange being it is from the same company).  Also, others who have recently visited my home and needed to connect to Wi-Fi had no problems going through my router with their devices.  I drove to a McDonalds for a test as well with some of my devices.  All my other devices connected to Wi-Fi at McDonalds including the Nook Color.  The Simple Touch ""found"" Wi-Fi at McDonalds but could not complete the connection using McDonald's ""proxy"" software where you had to comply before you could continue.  The Nook Color was presented the acceptance message from the proxy through the browser on the Nook Color.  I may not understand the correct procedure on the Simple Touch, but it does not appear to be obvious.  The Simple Touch did connect via Wi-Fi at B&N; and at my local library.

As I inventory the features, the NOOK seems to be superior. The reason is fundamentally that the navigation is made supremely more intuitive with the touch screen. The on-screen keyboard / menu items are actually useful to the consumers who really could benefit from these devices more than anyone: the elderly. The keyboard, being onscreen, is highly readable, though there is no adjustment for typeface variation or size to resolve reading difficulty, which seems to render other accommodations for the visually impaired redundant. What use is it to adjust the text inside the book, if it is difficult to read the menu and to navigate to the book in the first place? Though it is worth saying again, all items are indeed highly readable even without the adjustment capacity on the menu / keyboard levels. It is an improvement over the Kindle, which has the same weakness compounded with the static keyboard with low-contrast printed letters thereupon, and a more complicated menu system.When looking through the documentation that accompanies the device, and at BN.com, there is absolutely NO mention of the built-in memory whatsoever. 236MB is not a good selling point, but I find this evasive to completely hide this attribute from the consumer until having the device in hand and navigating the settings. It tarnishes my opinion of Barnes & Noble. Were it not for the overall superiority of this device over others, I would question whether or not to do business with them. That said, the ""offense"" is offset in part because I feel that most folks who would consider owning this device will already have a memory expansion on hand, probably left over after upgrading from early models of smartphones or cameras.There is no way to set the ""default"" storage to your memory expansion. The only method I have discovered to direct how memory is utilized without hacking the device is by connecting / synchronizing with a computer and manually placing files in the preferred locations.What really sold me on this device was the touch screen, intuitive / simple menu system, and its ability to use books borrowed from the library. The menus and on-screen keyboard functions, and the basic functions were learned within 2 weeks by my very elderly great-aunt. She had never before used a similar computerized device, though the learning curve is similar to that of a microwave oven. I believe this speaks well to the design team, though also indicates room for improvement.Regarding the ""Social"" features of the NOOK Touch: this is generally a nice feature. One can synchronize with Google, Facebook, and Twitter, posting commentary and inviting discussion and response to the material being shared. THE DOWN SIDE is that this is only supported if Barnes and Noble actually sold the book to the user. Side-loaded material is not up for discussion.There is a lightly functional Web browser embedded in the Search function of the NOOK Touch. It is basically the equivalent of a Mobile Web browser. I have had some mixed success with it. It does work, though I have found it to be rather unstable. Of the 5 tests I've run with it, It has caused the device to crash on 2. This was navigating the mobile version of Facebook. It was not advertised as a feature at all, so the fact that it exists is kind of an Easter Egg. Things to note with it are that the pages it loads are more difficult to read, since the Web is rendered in color and when rendering into gray scale the contrast tends to be low. However, it is useful to look up information in books that may be linked, or to post commentary on your Facebook / Google / Twitter accounts.One item which might prove important to a few, which I discovered to my disappointment is that the NOOK will not recognize a WiFi access point created by your cell phone. I realize that this is not likely a highly common issue, but it was an assumption I had made before purchasing the device for my great-aunt. This issue is not specifically the NOOK. It is because the NOOK is running on Android (according to the developers of the WMWifiRouter application). That said, the Kindle is also unable to access the Internet in this fashion. It's speculative to say whether or not this is a security measure based on my information set, but it is an issue that I'm sure at least a few others will wish to have known before purchasing.A case is a worthwhile consideration. Carrying the NOOK in one's pocket can create some issues with the touch screen, and it tends otherwise to cause the device to crash. However, I find that the so-called fashionable cases are absurdly priced. Consider at least two things before purchasing such items: they are made from cardboard wrapped in fabric; they are being offered for between $20 and $50. If you have an ambitious child, or an impulse to manufacture a cover with the same or better functionality as the covers available for the device, it is absolutely worthwhile to pursue that angle.I would consider buying this device again given the offerings on the market now.",4.0,Convenient Device; Where's the Memory?,1310688000,"07 15, 2011",Electronics,1.0

It now seems like fraudulent advertising because I've since read that the MSRP is $79.99Initially I had serious problems with the Nook, and requested a refund. The seller, BlueProton, refused to take returns or give a refund for it, and directed me to Barnes & Noble who referred me back to the seller, stating  that the seller should refund it within 14 days; at that time  I'd only had it a few days. My Amazon A to Z claim ended with Amazon siding with the seller, BlueProton because their policy stated that they would not accept returns on Nooks - something I did not see when I initially read their policy!Because neither BlueProton nor Barnes & Noble would take responsibility for the defective product, and their attitude was ""Take the money and run!"", I'm giving the Nook a low review although later I found an update for the Nook which resolved the problems - with no help or information from either seller or Barnes & Noble!I now enjoy using the Nook which is so much easier and more comfortable to hold than regular books while reading,  and to carry back & forth to work each day or to travel with. I don't like the gray screen which requires you to face the Nook towards the light; and I don't like the glare on the screen from the sun or lights. I have to sit ""just so"" to read it - which somewhat defeats the idea of portability. Overall I do like it, but it needs improvement.My favorite use of the Nook is to borrow my local library's digital books using the free Overdrive Media Console software which allows you to select & save your library (ies) and to directly access the digital library from it on your PC, and then sideload (drag & drop)the borrowed books to your Nook; no more time wasted or trips through rush hour traffic to browse, borrow or return books downtown, and no more parking hassles! Most of my library's digital books are in ePub format which is the native format of the Nook. However, as other reviewers have stated, you can still borrow or buy Kindle or other formats of digital books and convert them to ePub via the free Calibre software. Borrowed library books can be returned automatically when the loan periods expire, or can be returned manually earlier if you decide not to finish the book during the loan period.Ordinarily I don't buy many fiction books because I rarely read any of them more than once. Additionally, due to the poor customer service from both Amazon (who owns Kindle) and Barnes & Noble (who owns Nook) I am determined to rarely buy any books from either of these companies, and will primarily download either their free books or the library's loan books. The companies want us to buy their ebooks, but won't take responsibility for their e-readers, so that infuriates me and alienates me for life.The pros: the low price; comfort; convenience; savings from being able to borrow library books instead of buying something you'll only read once; no clutter of physical books; easy loaning to friends with a guarantee that they will be returned in 14 days (automatic returns); ability to read multiple formats via conversion in free Calibre software. The Nook can also read your PDF files/documents from your PC or elsewhere, plus it can use your JPEG files of photos to use as your custom screensavers; the Nook will convert them to B&W.;The cons: PlueProton's and Barnes & Nobles's total lack of responsibility for their defective Nooks - why I gave the Nook such a low rating; Amazon's siding with Blue Proton's irresponsible returns policy; dreary gray screen which makes it difficult to read except in bright lighting; touch screen not as sensitive and responsive as it should be - often have to touch the screen a few times before getting a response.Over all I'm pleased with my Nook Simple Touch now that I managed to FIX IT BY MYSELF, but the companies' irresponsible policies have soured me towards them for life.",2.0,no responsibility from sellers for initially defective  new product,1361836800,"02 26, 2013",Electronics,0.0

What a hassle!- In almost all e-books, it does not highlight words to look up where, on the line, there is not enough room to finish the word, adding a dash, and continuing it on the next line.

Seriously, I've played with the current e-ink Kindles, and the difference in refresh rate might SEEM small on paper, but in practice it's a very noticeable difference.- I never had the wifi problems others did after the November firmware update, but I understand that the latest firmware update should solve it.- The NST feels really nice when you're holding it, and I really like that there are physical page turn buttons in addition to the onscreen touch turning - I use both, depending on whether I'm sitting up or lying down when I read, etc.- Navigation is very intuitive.- I bought a $5 4gb micro SD card and have had no problems using it with the NST.- Sideloading non-DRMed, non-B&N; content downloaded from places like Project Gutenburg is very easy, and it all goes into the same library as your B&N; downloaded content.Cons:- The user interface is easy to use, but it's also VERY basic, and there are very few features.  You can organize your books into ""shelves,"" but only on the device itself, and it's a cumbersome process.  You can sort books by title, author, and date added, and... that's pretty much it.  The NST isn't a tablet and I don't want it to be, but there are still some pretty simple features that don't seem like it would have been that hard to add, and more flexible organization is one of them.- Once a book's in the library, you can't really see anything about it besides the title and author. Metadata from sideloaded content doesn't show up, and even purchased content requires you to be on wifi to see more information.That's about it. My cons list is really more of a wishlist, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the NST to anyone, especially at the lowered $99 price.  I imagine a new touch reader will probably be released within the next few months, but unless the user interface is majorly updated, it's hard to imagine I'd feel the need to upgrade, since the current version meets almost all of my needs perfectly well.",4.0,Best of the e-ink devices currently available,1333497600,"04 4, 2012",Electronics,1.0

It was covered under the damage warrantee,  but 1st Gen is not available any longer.  So I could have my choice of either NOOK color, or the simple touch.  I am so glad I chose the simple touch.  It does not do music,  audiobooks or videos.  No games.  Just your basic, no frills, dedicated reader.  That is all I need.  I expected the transition from the old NOOK to the new one to be difficult,  but it was actually seamless and quite painless.Several reviews I've read complained that transferring reading material from one to the other was difficult and time consuming.  However, I found it to be very easy.  All I had to do was register the Simple Touch in my account,  and my books appeared as if by magic.  I did have to ""help"" some of them,  but that was easy too, requiring just a touch on the download prompt.The touch keypad is larger and easier to use than on the 1st Gen, although with ""fat fingers"" or poor hand control,  a stylus makes a nice aid.Someone in another review forum said that the Simple Touch lacks the ability to highlight and make notes.  This is absolutely not so.  In fact,  these functions are actually easier than with the older device. Bookmarking has also been improved.  You get not only the page number,  but also a partial quote from the first line on the page.Another review stated that there is no provision made for preventing unauthorized purchases.  This also is untrue.  The owner may enable a password if desired.Navigating within a given book is much easier.  I have several devotionals,  Bibles and resource books and accessing various sections and chapters is incredibly simple.I would definitely buy the Simple Touch again.  I would give it as a gift.  I have already recommended it to friends.I did not care for any of the Barnes & Noble covers for the Simple Touch.

LIke Amazon, B&N; tries to lock readers in to purchasing from their store, but if you're resistant, it's easy to side-load books using Adobe Digital Editions or Calibre on either device. I've used both the Nook and Kindle readers and purchased the Nook ST for my personal use because I prefer to have buttons as well as the touch screen. This proved a prudent choice since the touch screen on the NST started malfunctioning about 6 months in. At first, using a Q-Tip to clean the edges of the screen worked (it's not a calibrated screen, but works using light sensors that can be blocked by dust). Then certain areas of the screen completely stopped working. I could not access my library, etc. I'll spare you the details of my four infuriating chats with B&N; customer service, but I ended up returning my Nook more than two weeks ago for them to look at and replace with a functional unit. I have heard nothing about its status since.Compare this to the customer service I received from Amazon when our work Kindle malfunctioned -- they replaced it without a murmur, after an actual phone conversation with an actual person. I sent in the old unit and we had a new one three days later.I think in a lot of ways the NST is superior to the Kindle Touch -- epub format, side buttons, ability to be hacked and used as a tablet -- but if I end up having to buy another ereader, I will seriously consider converting my ebook library to mobi and purchasing a Kindle, because if (when) something goes wrong with my ereader, I want someone to care.

I got it at launch, and used it frequently. Then... the iPad came out, and I found that when the B&N; eReader app came out, I was bringing my nook with me less, because, hey, I could just use the iPad to read, right? Why bring a device almost as big just to read books, when the eReader app (despite the drawbacks of a color screen vs. e-ink, etc.) worked just as well? So I sold the nook.Then a funny thing happened. I stopped reading as much. See, with the iPad I was watching videos, playing games, messing around with apps, etc. Which is great, but I just ended up opening things other than the eReader app. At the time this dawned on me, I immediately thought ""If only there was a smaller form factor for the nook, I'd probably take that with me more, and start reading again...""Enter the nook touch. It's much smaller, much lighter, and ditches the color touchscreen (which was frankly always a bit of a pain) at the bottom of the device. What you're left with is a lean, mean, reading machine. It's not without its flaws. I'm not going to touch on the platform itself (the original nook and nookColor reviews cover that pretty extensively), but I did want to talk about some of the differences from the eyes of an original nook owner.Even for a techie like me, I struggled with the interface at first, so here's a few items of note:The Good/Notable:- You can both tap the screen on the left or right side (left meaning page back, right meaning page forward) OR swipe left/right to turn pages.- Additionally there's buttons under the rubber on the left and right side of the front of the device. This has been an absolute boon for one-handed reading, which happens constantly for me with a device so light. Switching hands still gives me the power to paginate without having to change back.- Overall, the speed/snappiness of the device blows away the speed on the original nook + 1 update (i.e. the time when I ended up selling the nook). Page turning is near instant, the on/off speed and unlocking is far faster too. With one exception...The not-so-good:- The keyboard is pretty slow. Still. The infrared sensor that's used to detect touch requires a lot of patience and single-letter typing. This was really only an issue on initial setup for the wifi at my home. I honestly haven't used the keyboard in about a month. If I want to buy something, I do it via my phone's nook app, or the web.-  While my battery life is good *now*, it wasn't so good when I first got it. I had to run it down completely a few times and recharge before I started getting anything near the 1-month advertised time. It's more like 2-3 weeks now that it's baked in, but that beats the original nook I had, and honestly, if you can't be troubled to charge the thing overnight once every 3 weeks, I'm not sure what to say. Buy a smartphone so you're conditioned to charge things more regularly :P- The rubber on the device is great for grippiness in your hand (and it won't go sliding from anywhere you put it unless a 8.0 earthquake hits), but it tends to attract dust and grime, and the type of rubber makes it *incredibly* hard to clean except with some kind of wet nap.Overall, it's the original nook, in a smaller package, with better battery life, a touchscreen, and a cleaner interface.

So a used Nook it is and in the week or so I've been trying it out, it works just as well as I had hoped.

I didn't realize that if you buy books from B&N;, you can only read them on your Nook, and not on anything else.  So even though you paid for them, those books really aren't your property.  You have no access to them if you don't use their products! Still, I liked the fact that it used ePub, and you had a variety of stores you could buy from and also that libraries have more ePub books available.  However, I just heard that their latest firmware update prevents you from reading any books except those bought from B&N.; If I had known this I never would have bought the Nook. It's as consumer un-friendly as you can get!  Really a nasty way to do business.  Amazon is different.  Once you buy a book, it is yours.  You can read it on any device. When it comes to buying books, Amazon is far easier to use and alot more consumer friendly.  The Kindle is by far a better choice of the two.I am returning the Nook after only a week, because this is a frustrating product that doesn't function like it is supposed to do.  There are simply too many glitches in how the touch screen works to be reliable. Here are the cons:  First, it often takes multiple touches to access anything.  You touch or swipe the screen, and nothing happens.  You try it again, and still nothing.  What a joke.  Second, pages turn mysteriously on their own and without warning, both forward and backward.  I am always losing my place when I try to read a book.  I've noticed that this happens almost every time you alter the angle of the Nook.  If you're reclining and turn to adjust the pillow, don't expect to return back to the same page you were on.  Third, the pop-up menu and dictionary are too easy to activate by accident.  If you hold the Nook too close to the screen, or at the top or bottom, the pop-up menu will appear or the dictionary will activate unintentionally.  This happens several times an hour.  You can't just simply sit down, relax and read unless you sit motionless in a chair and hold it on your lap. Last of all, it does not use a standard USB/micro USB cable. The USB connection to the computer is standard, but the micro USB connection to the Nook itself is NOT!  It is thinner and wider.  You can only use the cord provided with the Nook to connect to your computer to transfer files or charge the batteries.  You can't use the standard USB cord that works with all of your other electronic gadgets, like your digital camera or your portable hard drive.  So if you need a longer cord, or lose their cord, you're out of luck. Talk about a major inconvenience, one that makes zero sense!  Pros: I did like that it recharges in under 4 hours and that it has a very long battery life.",2.0,"Not consumer friendly, full of glitches",1325203200,"12 30, 2011",Electronics,0.0

Now when I turn on the Nook, it gives me a dual boot screen (sort of). I can go to the Android desktop or the the Nook screen.

Be prepared to meet with an army of know-nothing, apparently deceptive incompetents. Any merits of B&N's Nook products are offset by the company's Customer Service from hell. Today, trying to resolve the problem of having just received a Nook Simple Touch lemon, I've been lied to, hung up on, and received no help at all. The return call, promised by a supervisor at around six this evening, never came. So, around 4 hours later, I called back and spoke to another supervisor, identifying myself and asking for help. This call was disconnected on B&N's side, and that supervisor never called me back or emailed me to provide service.  I've also been advised that I'll have to wait quite a while for a replacement Nook, though I live in Manhattan and the site promises same-day Manhattan delivery. I'd read reviews on the B&N site and, I believe, on Amazon as well, about B&N's horrific so-called Customer Service. I can see now, from experience, that the horror stories are true. So if you buy a Nook from B&N and get a lemon, as can happen with any e-device, you're going to find yourself quite alone with your problem.

Also, if you sort the books by &#34;Recent&#34; it does not show the most recently read books in order, but still displays books in order of &#34;recently downloaded&#34;, not a useful function.But on a positive note, the Nook combines the touch facilities and button control (to turn the pages) of both the Kindle Touch & normal kindle. The borrowing of ebook a from public libraries is done on your PC, then imported onto the Nook via Adobe Digital Editions. A bit of a hassle, but a good option which Kindles do not offer.

I thought the Nook would be a great gift for her, after reading reviews here on Amazon that it can download and read free ebooks from library sites. Our local library offers ebooks so I thought it would be great.After getting the Nook, I learned a number of things:1. The Nook does NOT have a browser. It can only connect to the Barnes and Noble online bookstore.2. You are REQUIRED to have a valid credit card, even to download free content.3. While there is a way to root (hack) the Nook and thus enable a functional browser, it voids the warranty and is way too complicated to follow. I shouldn't have to hack a device to enable such a basic functionality.My mother isn't very computer savvy, and doesn't own a credit card, so I couldn't give her something like this. If it let you connect to library sites and download library books for free, it would be an ideal ereader. In it's current form, it's an overly-complicated money sinkhole. Now I'm out $70 and I still need to buy my mother a birthday present.I don't know why some of these other reviewers claim it can be used to download library ebooks. Claiming that a device has a functionality that it in fact does not have, is a really despicable thing to do.If you don't mind a wireless device owning a copy of your credit card, and throwing money at it to read books, then the Barnes & Noble Nook is right for you.

It started out holding a charge for several days, then reduced the time to about two days. So, I began trying to get a replacement. Amazon took no responsibility--sent me to Barnes and Noble for satisfaction. So....Amazon is NOT the place to order a NOOK. That's my first warning for anyone wanting this e-reader!Dealing with B&N;: First they claimed I had actually purchased the NOOK more than a year ago and thus the warranty had expired. It took a lot of phone time to prove their records were wrong. (I think perhaps they sent me a used NOOK that someone else had purchased and returned.) After much phone time, they saw that I had a record of purchase for just this year. Then I began going through their lengthy bureaucratic process to get a replacement. At the end, they demanded that I pay for the replacement, with my money to be refunded when my old one is sent back. I said no--no way was I going to trust B&N; with more of my money. So they said I could do this exchange at a store. Unfortunately, the closest store has closed, and another is 70 plus miles away, but I don't have much choice. I said OK, I'd do this exchange at that store, but probably it would take me a couple of months before I traveled to that area. No problem, they said. That'll be fine. Then they sent me an email that said, Do this right away, the replacement will be good for only a limited time!Meanwhile, I have a largely useless device for which I paid almost $100. Will I ever get a working device? Well, for over 3 months, I have not and I'm not optimistic.

Most course tests and quizzes allow us to use our notes, but the time available for each assignment is very limited.  Since e-books allow me to search for information that I don't know off the top of my head, it saves me a lot of time versus using the traditional book format.  That being said, I try to use e-books as much as possible.  I spend several hours a day reading to keep up with class assignments, and I often develop headaches from looking at my Macbook Pro screen.  My husband suggested that I look into an e-ink device.  I compared the NST with the basic Kindle and felt that the ePub support and touch screen of the Nook would fit my needs best.  Could you imagine typing notes with that direction control on the Kindle?I am very happy with my choice and I've found the hardware design, screen clarity, battery life, and software to be fabulous.  In short, this device fits that needs that I was looking to have filled.That being said, some people will probably be perfectly satisfied with the Kindle.  It's all about getting your own needs met.  So sure, look through reviews.  However, if someone is complaining about a lack of Wikipedia integration in the nook, determine if that feature is even important to you.  For me, it wasn't.

Touch screen is about as responsive as my iphone 4s.  Includes cable that has a standard USB a jack that plugs into just about everything: the computer, my hub, and the standard variety of wall worts and car chargers.This device is hard directed for ""easy setup"".  Too hard.  There should be a way to accept the TOU and get to using the device.  Forcing wifi setup and registration is just bad planning.Wifi - This is the stupidest thing about this device.  Once you charge it up, you turn it on, it asks for you to agree to terms, then it goes through wifi setup.  Note, you must HAVE wifi, AND connect to it successfully for the setup process to continue.  At this time, I'm stuck.  I'm in a town with limited wifi options, so it's not like I can just select a local hotspot.  Until i register the device, I have a brick.I have an old Netgear Router 802.11g&b; with wep and wpa protection.  The nook is capable of wpa2 security, but managed the wep and wpa security pretty nicely.  Strange thing was that I could get past the password, but it still would not connect to the internet (I checked the setup with my iPhone and everything worked fine).  Customer service had very few answers and only about 3 steps for me to take to fix the problem.  I tiered up to the supervisor and managed to pry out of her that the Nook runs on an 802.1x EAP network.  Upon googling it, this looks like the same network that causes a lot of android problems.  Next step is to hunt down a public wifi and try again.However: As soon as the thing charged and turned on, it showed up on my desktop and I was able to upload screensavers, books, documents, etc.  The device has a VERY small available memory, (about 250Mb), so text only books can be loaded, but not large PDFs (I bought this to enjoy the Modernist Cuisine series, 300Mb+ PDFs).  I had an old version of Calibre that worked right away.I'll change this review and maybe the two stars rating once I have something more than an expensive SD card reader to play with.UPDATE (after a stop at Denny's)Okay, sure enough, Once in a local restaurant with free wifi, I was able to connect, register and start using my nook.  I made sure I had a couple books on it when I left, so I was able to read a chapter before I paid the check.In good light, this screen is beautiful.  The characters are crisp and clear, it's easy to read, and you can make several screen adjustments including a limited list of fonts, size and margins.  In lower light, the dark grey on light grey screen gets tougher to read than, say, a printed sheet of paper.  Still, in my apt with only a 60 watt light illuminating the room, it's still pretty easy to read.You get two choices on how the side buttons function.  Personally, I like the lower one turning the page forward; because I tend to hold it in the lower corner, cupped in my hand.  However, you can swipe the screen to turn pages, too.The OS on the nook is a little simpler than, say the kindle fire.  And maybe that's why I like it better.  On this device, books are books are books.  They can be epubs, pdfs, purchased or uploaded, they all go the same place, and they all end up in the same list.  Nothing grinds my gears more than having to look 2-3 places for things based on where you bought them, or some other phantom difference established by the designers (or worse, the marketing department - I'm looking at you Kindle).  The down side to this that if you have a large ebook library, you are pretty much stuck using the search function.  There doesn't seem to be a way to organize books any other way. [checking online....] Oh crap, they have this whole ""shelf"" system built in.  Damn, scratch that organizational thing, I'll get back to ya there.Screen Savers.Forget about those fancy things on your PC, the nook's idea of a screen saver is to place a picture on the screen when it sleeps.  The default is a bunch of pictures of famous authors.  nice, you can also choose nature scenes.  But, remember I said that you could upload directly to the nook?  Well, here ya go. Create a folder with the name of your screen saver set, upload some 800x600 pics (jpg/png formats) in portrait mode and Voila! You have your own custom set.  I went to nook.com and downloaded a bunch of Str Trek Geeky stuff at first, but then realized I could just take a few snapshots and convert them to 16 greys myself.  Now I have a folder of a dozen of MY pictures as the screen saver.  Very nice.  Kinda like having an image viewer as well.Calibre.Getting calibre to work with the device once it was working was a complete breeze.  I bought a 16gb micro SD on sale and added it.  The card mounts on the desktop separately, but calibre is all tuned up to read them correctly.  So, when you put stuff on the device, you have the option of loading it in main memory or on the card.  Come to think of it, a series of small cards could be another way to organize as well.  Put your SF collection on this card, classics on that one, etc.  Fun.Oh, also, once I got the registration completed at Denny's I went into settings and disconnected the wifi.  It's been operating in that mode ever since.  So, only that first time is needed.Adding two more stars for all the juicy goodness.  I'll play around with it a while and see if we can get it to 5.  No real serious problems yet.UpdatePDFs - Okay, so pretty much everything else that displays pdfs tries to incorporate the formatting of the document.  This strange little device actually reads the text (easiest way to save formatting = text + format), and produces it in standard format.  It's a little disorienting but it makes for a much more consistent reading experience.Micro SDI think my real problem with this device was getting a huge SD card for this then thinking I had to fill it with a whole library.  Bah!  Granted, those 6 really large PDFs need some room, but I could have fit them all on a 2 Gb card and still had plenty of room to spare.  *sigh*  All that room meant I could have 100s of books on the device.  Think: Tim Taylor "" More Power!"" {grunt grunt}Shelves.  The device keeps track of the shelves internally, so it's not like a document you could edit outside the device and use your computer's search function to organize.  you MUST go through your entire library, no search functions, one book at a time to add to shelves.  Great if you know what you're looking for, but not all sets start with Lord of the Rings 1: ....If you buy this, don't get an external card right away.  the onboard memory can hold a lot of stuff.  Shorter onboard lists mean you have less stress with shelves and such.I won't be exploring the B&N; store for a while (a Long while).  I have a massive library to work through first.  So look elsewhere for those reviews.  I've heard the store is mighty nice though.No ads, easy to use, a joy to read.  This, my final entry sees that last star moving up the device.  Take heed of the speedbumps I've experienced and enjoy this cute little reader.  Now, I just need a case.....  :)ANOTHER UPDATE: Months later and I've read a small library on this thing.  It's a delight.  but I still find myself avoiding PDFs a lot because of the disorientation.  Also: to the 2 people who did NOT find this review helpful - Bite me.

I'm now wondering if I have chosen poorly or perhaps fickle Murphy's law strikes.I have had my NOOK for less than a month, just long enough to NOT be able to return it (14 days) and have become somewhat disenchanted.  I take this thing everywhere b/c I love to read.  Not infrequently, it will magically be dead even though it was put to sleep and in it's case after just being charged.  In addition, battery life is OK, not the greatest when it isn't magically dead - even with putting it in Airplane mode and all the other things they recommend.Now, after purchasing a skin, and case for it, I am wishing I could return it.  After frequently picking it up when I had but a few moments to read a page or two, and finding it dead or not working, now, it has decided to ""update"" itself (without my permission) and now I get to reset the ENTIRE thing.  Re-register even.  It was painful the first time.  All of my books have been erased, my settings are gone and I'm an unhappy customer.My father LOVES to mention how he hasn't had any of these issues with his KINDLE.Now, when it's working the NOOK is great, but due to the lack of reliability, I would not purchase it again.UPDATE - after contacting Barnes and Noble, I received very little help with actually trying to figure out what is wrong.

With the time period, I could still return my nook, but I'm still completely in love with it and don't want the kindle for the reasons below.I was one of those people who was averse to the idea of an e-reader for a long time. I liked the feel of a real book, I was in love with free books at the library, why would I start paying for them? Then, my library got ""overdrive"", which is e-books FREE from the library. Then one day soon after, I woke up and the urge for an e-reader was there. The Nook was my final choice. It took a lot of back and forth and research to get to this point. I bought and tried the Sony Touch reader, returned it, and went and got the Nook. I really honestly wanted the Kindle most, because I'm a loyalist. I love Amazon and felt really comfortable here if I decided to actually start purchasing books again. But below, I'll give you comparisons to the three big readers and the reasons I got the nook:- Nook(N) by barnes & noble- Kindle 3(K) by amazon.com- Sony Reader Touch(ST)1. My biggest decision maker was Epub. This is the format in which you can take ebooks out of the library, so I needed whatever I got to be Epub friendly.N: The Nook is epub friendly. As well as PDF, and many other formats.K: The Kindle won't use Epub, which was all I needed to know. It mainly uses it's own Amazon format,while it also uses PDF, mobi and a few others. It makes me feel like Amazon is being greedy, wanting us to only use and buy books from the amazon site. Don't they understand that I love my library?ST: Sony reader is Epub friendly. pretty much the same as the nook.2. PRICE!N: 149 with wifiST: 169 NO WIFIK: 139 with wifi(or 189 with wifi and free 3G)While kindle 3 is 10 dollars cheaper, it doesn't give me those free library books, so it really doesn't make any difference to me.*You can now lend some books from the Nook for 14 days to a friend with their new ""lend me"" technology. While this is in beta stages, and not ALL books are lendable. It depends on the agreement with the publisher. The other two you cannot lend at all.*The Nook has a replaceable, rechargable battery. So it'll last awhile, but when its dwindling, you can spend 30 bucks and put a new one in yourself. For the Kindles, they are sealed inside. People have said you can do it yourself, but you must be tech savvy. Or you can send it away to Amazon for about the cost of [...]+shipping charges and they'll replace it for you.*You can expand your memory on the Nook and on the Sony touch. The Kindle you cannot, though the Kindle will hold 3,500 books, don't know if you need more space then that?!*Nook has a fancy color touch screen at the bottom. While the Sony touch has a touch screen(the entire screen), it was slow to respond, very klunky and not very pretty. The kindle is loaded with buttons along the outside of the screen.* all three have a built in dictionary, which I think is just awesome.*The new kindle now meets with the nook on their slim width. People used to say the nook was more comfortable to hold because of the width, now the kindle will be as well.*Yet, the Nook is heavier by about 3 oz then the Kindle or Sony.*The Nook battery life lasts about 10 days with wifi off, the Sony has 14 days, and the new kindle is up to a month with wifi off(3 weeks with it on)This wasn't a big deal to me, and I was more interested in the other features the Nook DID have, like replaceable battery and expandable memory.*And you may be wondering, why did I purchase a Sony Touch, and then scamper back hours later to return it? Well. When I got it out of the box, it wasn't techy enough for me. It felt like a very basic, bare bones E-reader. And I already had in my head all the things you hear about the nook: books more expensive, and for some reason I thought it wasn't epub friendly. But the moment I had that Sony in my hand, I went to look at the nook more indepth online. The Sony online library was nothing in comparison to Kindle's Amazon.com or Nook's Barnes & Noble. One of my favorite reads recently was The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins. It was nowhere to be found on Sony. That gave me a bad taste in my mouth.*In the past people have complained that Barnes & Noble is significantly more expensive then Amazon. I did some price comparisons of big titles, and found them most of the time to be exactly the same. I think Barnes & Noble might be trying to keep in line with Amazon to draw more readers(Like ME!) into getting the Nook.On the whole, the nook is everything I wanted. I've downloaded some free classics from google books, I've taken out library ebooks and it was REALLY easy! I even bought my first book(well, ebook) in a long time. Despite being a new release, it was under ten bucks. I also bought another book I've been meaning to read for years for under four dollars. The nook is comfortable to hold with one hand. I like the using the touch screen to ""swipe"" and turn pages. And tops on my list, I didn't feel horrificly guilty for buying it. One fifty is a reasonable price for such a fun new book reader.Update Oct '10: A software update is coming in Nov:""dramatically increase page turn speed, customized B&N; Library organization and password protection. It also includes the ability to sync across all NOOK and all devices enabled with our free NOOK apps, by syncing your last page read. If you forget your NOOK at home, use the NOOK app for iPad, iPhone, iPod touch, Android smartphone or PC to pick up where you left off. And, the next time you pick up your NOOK, the Reading Now page will be updated and ready to go.Update Dec '10: The update was a pinch to install, and it has some stellar perks that make the nook even more loveable. The shelving option it a lot of fun for those people who like to organize. You can name a shelf anything you want. The only limit is your Barnes and Noble book will stay in their Barnes folder, while any other books you have will stay in My Documents. The page turn is very fast. I do read across multiple devices, but for most people that will be a great new feature.",5.0,Comparison: Nook vs. Kindle 3 vs. Sony Touch from a library book lover,1279584000,"07 20, 2010",Electronics,1.0

The only mechanical controls are page-forward and page-back arrows on each side of the Nook. You can also turn pages on the Nook by swiping the touch-screen. In comparison the Kindle keyboard just looks ugly to me but thats all a matter of personal taste. I feel the Nook is better built compared to the Kindle. One important feature on the Nook is ""airplane mode"" (just like the iPhone) so that you can still turn it on and it won't transmit data which is important for flight safety. I travel internationally a lot and that's important for me. You can lend books to friends unlike the Kindle and iPad, which although limited on the Nook, is still a feature that I can use from time to time to lend books to my finance. You can't read the book yourself while it's being lent out.  It holds as many as 1,500 books using a 2GB Micro SD but you can always put in a large Micro SD which so you will never have a problem with storage space on the Nook (this is lacking in the iPad). The iPad is also bigger than the Nook and the Kindle. The Nook's weight is comparable to the Kindle but it is much lighter than the iPad (which weighs 1 1/2 pounds compared to the Nook's 12 ounces). The iPad is hard to handle with one hand as comfortably as the Kindle or the Nook. The iPad's screen, which allows reading in the dark really doesn't do it for me - did anyone read in the dark anyway before e-readers? It is not healthy! I like the Nook's ink screen, and it is for this reason I think serious readers will never replace the Nook or the Kindle with an iPad. The Nook software is based on a version of the Android operating system, which is an open platform, unlike Apple's and Kindle's ""lock everything"" mentality. This means that the intent of the Nook's maker, B&N is not as controlling and monopolizing. The software played a key factor in my choice of the Nook. The Nook software has been updated in several significant respects. It now incorporates a browser and is by no means great (just as bad as the Kindle's), but works better than my Blackberry's. The software upgrade has addressed the problems that you read about in most of the reviews, which were written before the last update. I believe that in due course the Nook will attempt to migrate towards a capable browser in the direction of the iPad. Like the Kindle the Nook has free 3G and free Wi-Fi. The only drawback of the Nook is its limited ability to buy books while you are out of the US. You can use it to read the books which you have already bought while in the US, but if like me, you spend more time out of the US than within, you are stuck with B&N putting a limitation on accessing its store if your IP address is non-US, and you cannot use a non-US credit card to buy books from its store. Since the Kindle has such international capability and doesn't care where you credit card is issued, I believe Nook will eventually do a software update that enables downloading and buying books on the Nook when not in the US. The Nook reads pdfs (like the Kindle) but unlike the Kindle the Nook will let you read the books you already have because it is compatible with the e-pub format. Reading e-pub was a key deciding factor for me. There has been new updates to the Nook like ability to read books free while you are sitting in a B&N bookstore. I like this because it keeps the emotional feel of being in a book store and picking up any book and reading it. Now you do it on the Nook! Amazon overprices the Nook. You can get the Nook at USD260 in Best Buy, as of the date of this review.",4.0,Worthy if not better opponent to the Kindle,1273708800,"05 13, 2010",Electronics,1.0

Otherwise, it's a well executed first attempt. I used it for a week and returning it was not an easy decision.1) PDF support is lacking, I can't read many of my technical PDF books (and documents) and even after I bought a pair of magnifying glasses (text size remains unchanged for some of my PDF's, like ""Mastering Regular Expressions"" which I have just downloaded from Safari). I seriously think that my technical PDF ebooks deserve better zoom support or a bigger screen.2) If you take into consideration the cost of hardware and ebooks, and the inability to buy used ebooks, I feel I am paying more and getting less, I compared the first ebook I bought from BN, ""Guns, Germs and Steel"" by Jared Diamond, with a printed book(ebook for $9.99 and gently used copy for $7.47), after I noticed that some material was missing, like all the maps and black and white photos, and I was able to confirm the missing pages and figures.4) The dictionary is hard to use (usability issue, the cursor is very jumpy).5) Returning the Nook to a BN store was a nightmare (horrible customer service), it's very sad since the gentleman who helped me with my purchase was as nice as competent (this recent event is tipping my choice towards the Kindle DX)Here are the reasons why (before the nightmarish return episode) I thought I will give BN and the next Nook a second chance:1) The Nook rocks, (mostly) easy to use, the screen is very good, very easy to hold and page navigation is awesome.2) Page turns are fast enough that I didn't notice any substantial delay.3) A DX competitor would be a very interesting addition (as well as adding the ability to create folders).4) EPUB format is supported.5) The staff at my local AZ BN was super friendly (I wrote this before it was returned).6) BN's decision to base the software on Android was brilliant, Android is solid enough and maturing super fast (Amazon should make the same move).This is what the Kindle DX needs to get me on board:1) External memory card access.2) EPUB format support.",4.0,Very good product,1278979200,"07 13, 2010",Electronics,1.0

They will honor purchases up to two weeks prior to the launch of the promotion.  I bought mine 5/22 and my gift card arrives in 10 business days!  Now that's what I call a customer-focused company with excellent customer service.  Another and very important reason why nook beats Kindle.nook review:I did my research on e-readers and thought long and hard about the two main contenders - nook and Kindle.  I chose the nook.  Why?...1) It's design is future-proof (as far as anything is) because the hardware is designed such that software and firmware updates can make it more functional in the future.  Kindle requires new hardware. I just read a new one will be out in August '10, and no, no touch screen!2) Amazon (Kindle) is not a dedicated book store whose sole livelihood is books, like B&N; (nook).  Amazon has demonstrated this with its wrangling with publishers to the dismay of both the publishers and Amazon's customers3) Yes, the nook was rushed out last year but they are now already on V1.3 software, but it works well and has added features and corrected some early flaws.  The page turns are now quicker and very acceptable, especially compared with a real book page turn.  Whoever you are with, they will have some problems and features you do or don't like.  There are supposedly more books via B&N;, but never the books you actually want to read - Kindle has some missing for me as well as B&N.;B&N; will no doubt keep updating its software regularly and Amazon make you pay for new Kindles (and risk you not being able to read your e-books on the next version, like V1 to V2)E-book pricing is a little crazy right now as publishers seem to be trying to establish the ""value"" of e-books versus paperback/hardcover.  Some e-books are more expensive and some are changing prices weekly.  It's the same situation with both Kindle and nook from what I can tell.4) The touch screen is a nice feature (future-proofed hardware), but big fingers can hit the wrong selection occasionally.  It is comparable with the iTouch touchscreen performance IMHO.  Navigation is maybe more hassle than the Kindle as a result.  This also makes the nook smaller (no physical keyboard to worry about) and easier to hold, even though it is marginally heavier than the Kindle.5) The nook can be personalized with your own photos for wallpaper and screen-savers (wrong wording as it's just a picture for when the nook is in sleep mode - No burn-in with e-ink screens). You can add more storage in a nook with a micro SD card6) The Kindle battery lasts longer, but the nook is fine with the Wi-Fi turned off - about 10 hours.  The nook battery is user-replaceable and costs just $29, unlike the Kindle7) The nook extended warranty covers ANY accidental breakage/spillage for the full 2 years.8) A B&N; store is always nearby to get help in person and they currently offer a free book per week when you visit the store (in week 2 of 5 right now)9) Using independent free software available on the web (Calibre), I can convert and ""sideload"" documents and news feeds to my nook.  I have sideloaded web pages (originally saved as HTML), word documents and .pdf's, all in .epub format.  This is no doubt possible with Kindle too, but the nook is more than flexible for my needs.  I read USA Today and The BBC news feeds on my nook every day and they include B&W; photos and diagrams which are clearly readable.  Calibre has many more available.10) Using Sigil, again free software, I can modify e-books to add chapters or correct errors and sideload them to my nook.  Again, no doubt a possibility with Kindle, but I am not sure.11)  Nook is just the one size, no Kindle DX equivalent.  For my needs though, the small nook is ""back pocket"" sized (literally fitting in my back pocket) and is small enough to read but carry around.  I need reading glasses without exception to read and so can read at the smallest text size with no problem.12)  I'm not bothered about having a music player and the built-in speakers are not really capable as listening devices (tinny and low volume), but it's there and will no doubt allow for text-to-speech in a future software release, which will be useful.  The sound quality through headphones is good.I've had my nook a week and have read two books and many daily news articles.  It's comfortable to use, it's fun to use and while maybe a luxury we could all do without, I've read a couple free e-books that otherwise, I would never have done - and I have many more downloaded and ready in the wings.  It's actually now a hassle to read through a real paperback or hardcover.  :-)The choice is yours, but my choice was the nook and I think it was a good choice.UPDATE 6/2/10 - .PDF's on the nookI have found that .pdf books, especially with charts and diagrams (ie technical/text books) are problematic to read on the nook.  Interestingly the B&N; store personnel stated that they had never tried to read a .pdf on the nook - maybe just a way to avoid the issue??  However, the Kindle will no doubt have the same issue, unless you use the DX which is larger and so you can read .pdf's natively.If you read a native .pdf on the nook it is the whole page squeezed down to the 5"" screen - impossible to read.  If you use Calibre to convert the .pdf to .epub format, then the end result is variable.  Diagrams get screwed up or disappear and while text can be enlarged with the font size function, even the text formatting may or may not be acceptable.Either way, I have given up trying to read such books on my nook.  :-(I would not recommend the nook to anyone trying to use it for school where .pdf's are the only format available.  The problem is not nook/Kindle, but the way .pdf's are created.  They don't have the necessary information encoded to be able to convert them to other e-reader formats and retain their .pdf look.  If you are going to save any documents for conversion to .epub format, don't use .pdf.  I have found saving as .HTML renders a perfectly acceptable .epub file when converted, including diagrams and charts when archiving web pages, for example.See also my review of the JAVOedge Snake Skin Case for Barnes & Nobles Nook (Flip Style)",4.0,nook review,1275177600,"05 30, 2010",Electronics,1.0

I brought it to work the first day I got it and showed everyone, and they all wanted to go out and get one (actullay 1 of them did). Right out of the box I was able to start navigating the menus with ease.The e-ink technology is really cool.  It resembles a real book page.  The brighter the light, the better it looks, so outdoor reading is possible compared to a backlit screen that fades when you go outside.After reading many of the other reviews on here, you almost get the feeling that the Nook has many issues or problems.  I can tell you that none of those ""issues"" have occured on my Nook.  Now I can tell you this, when I tried to dwnld my first book, it was having some issues.  It couldn't connect to the store, so after contacting customer service, the problem was quickly recognized and solved.  The problem was user error. When I registered my Nook, I typed my credit card # in wrong, and that's what caused the problem.  So make sure you enter your info in correctly to help avoid that error.  :)I was on the fence for a while about which e-reader to choose.  So I went to a B&N; and played with a Nook.  I was sold immediatly! Part of the reason was beacuse there happened to be a customer standing right next to me that had the Kindle 2 in his hand. I got to play with both and compare them at the same time.  The Kindle 2 was very nice, but just felt a little cheaper, not as solid-feeling like the Nook.  Plus the keyboard on the kindle leaves little room for you to hold it.  The Nook just felt so much better in my hand.  The screen navigating was much more simple too in comparison to the Kindle. The customer that had the Kindle was in the store to look at the Nook! He wasn't completely satisfied with the Kindle, so he was comparing them too!I can literally go on for days, but I do need to get back to work.  Get the Nook, you won't be sorry!",5.0,On the fence?

What sold me on the nook vs. the Kindle was really the fact that I could go to the store and try it out before hand, and the fact that it is more open.  It's primary use was going to be reading but I also wanted to be able to browse the web - just gmail and reading forums - and the ability to go to B&N; and try out my favorite sites and make sure they worked really sold me on it.  I also saw that the same Stephen King book was only $9.99 on it...After having used it for a few weeks and having read 3 or 4 books on it, I like it even more than I had thought.  It's actually surprisingly good at web browsing (at least for the text heavy web pages I tend to visit) as long as you don't have to type anything more than a few sentences - and this wouldn't be a problem if it were easy to tell where your cursor was within the text if you want to go back and change something.  It does drain the battery relative to just reading, but relative to a laptop or cell phone (or even iPad), it will last hours just web browsing - and no eye strain.  The interface for the web browser could use a little work in that sometimes when I want to hit the back button on the touchscreen, I actually hit the back to main menu button.  It would also be good if the browser remembered your preferred zoom level for web pages (at least for bookmarks).  The preview of all of the books is a really nice feature and being able to then buy the book immediately after reading the first 25 or so pages is both good and bad - good because you can preview a book before buying, and bad because you end up getting sucked in and want to read the rest.  I'm a fast reader, so the B&N; store features are nice for me as I can get 1/4 or so through a book in the hour allocated.  The free weekly books are also nice as you get exposed to stuff that may be out of your usual reading and can be interesting.  The only problem I have is that sometimes it doesn't want to wake up from sleep and will then re-boot, but it's never lost my place in a book or suffered any ill effects.

However, I have been extremely surprised by how much I love using my nook! I got it as a graduation gift from college, and there are many things I love about it. It's easy to read and carry around with me. The first book I read on it was Gone with the Wind, which would have been pretty big to carry around! It is very easy to use, I love the color touch screen, and I love getting the free classics! It is wonderful to travel with (so that I don't have to bring my whole library with me!) and it has a looong battery life. I have been able to use it continuously without charging it for 7 or 8 days. It charges pretty quickly as well. I've put my pictures and music on it, and I enjoy playing the games. The only downside is that the internet feature is fairly slow on it, although I regularly check my e-mail and facebook on it anyway. It holds 1500 books, so I won't be running out of space any time soon (although I could get the additional memory if I needed to). I have heard good things about the kindle as well, but I have to say that I am very very glad I have a nook. The nook has a replaceable battery so that once the battery runs out of juice eventually, I can just replace the battery rather than the entire product (unlike the kindle).

Recommend leaving Airplane mode on except when you actually need connectivity (to purchase books, mainly).  You can always turn Airplane mode off overnight while charging so you can have your Daily updated by morning.Replaceable battery -- does the Kindle let you do that?  That's what I thought.Touchscreen -- love it.  Breaks the monotony of monotone.  But that's not why I love it so well.  I enjoy the swiping feature to turn pages.  Very cool, but also functional.  Arrows work, but swiping takes it to another usability level.  I also like the navigation process in the touchscreen.  Works well for me for getting around.  No, it's not like a mouse, but this is an ereader, not a laptop.  The virtual keyboard works fine for me, but I can see issues if you have double-wide fingers (smile), but just use your fingertips and you're fine.Lending -- don't think I'll use that too much because I don't have lots of friends or family with nooks to be able to do this with, but it's there and it's darn cool to have this as an OPTION.Borrowing ebooks from public libraries -- what's not to like about that???  You get to read current titles for FREE.  My library has a note that Amazon does not allow ebooks from the library to be read on Kindles...I'd be ticked about that if I owned a Kindle.Looks -- I'm a function over form guy most of the time, but sorry, the nook is MUCH better looking than a Kindle.  The form factor is just less cluttered and it feels solid and comfortably weighted.  There's a certain amount of trade-offs between real or virtual keyboards, but I much rather have the touchscreen than a Big Momma chicklet keyboard taking up all that real estate.More open ebook format options -- less DRM hassles.  Period.Expandable memory with microSD cards -- nice option.  (Although room for 1,500 books in on-board memory is mind-boggling as it is.)So...  I think the nook, that's all of one Christmas season old, and the Kindle, that has matured in the market for several years already now, are both amazing products.  But, no one can tell me the nook is not AS good as a Kindle or even better with some of its features.  In fact, I believe many of the issues people ran into with their nooks are not unlike issues that Kindle owners run into, especially when Kindle was only 3 months old way back when (like the nook).  And to be frank, many of the complaints that came forth prior to v1.2 and even now are because people REFUSE to read the manual or go to the help web sites or message boards that explain many of the fixes or get-arounds or instructions for the people who are allergic to reading those aforementioned manuals.",5.0,Fantastic e-reader.

When I first heard of the Kindle, I thought the idea was pretty absurd, to need an electronic device that mimics something as universally understood as a book.  However, as I grew older and grew more cynical that I will probably never get my 10+ books I've lent out over the years back, the idea of an e-reader started to sound more desirable.  Enter the Nook.I've read a lot of bad press on this little guy.  Most of the bad press seemed to stem from consumer reviews, which I honestly take to heart more-so than professional critics.  Here is a list of things I've noticed people don't seem entirely too fond of regarding the Nook, and my experience with these 'negative' aspects.- Battery Life.  Although shorter than some e-readers (but not at ALL as short as the Nook color or any tablets you may purchase/already have) I haven't yet felt constricted or nervous that my battery will deplete midway through a book.  I would think that considering the era we're in of constantly recharging our phones (I have to recharge my Droid Incredible nearly every 8 hours after moderate usage) we would be a little more forgiving if the Nook only lasts a mere week.  I don't mind recharging it once/twice a week while I sleep... I don't think anyone should to be honest, but that's just me.- LCD touch screen. This is one of those gripes I find somewhat warranted.  This is definitely the reason for the shorter battery life (set it to sleep after 10 or 30 seconds, and brightness to about 15%) but my biggest gripe is that it can be unresponsive at times.  I never once, however, found the navigation to be clunky or as unresponsive as some people claim... but I think these gripes found in earlier reviews has been remedied through a major update to the Nook firmware.  Yay!  I found the navigation to be highly intuitive and the built in dictionary highly helpful.I love this thing.  I love being able to read Barnes & Noble classics for free, checking e-books out from the library, and the prospect of sharing books with others who own a Nook.

What appealled to me most were the web browser & ePub use to check out books from the library. However, after fully charging the nook, I took it with me for a weekend at the beach. I didn't bring the the charger because B&N; said battery would last up to 10 days with wireless off. Well, I found out the hard way, with wireless on, it barely a couple hours reading at night & in the afternoon by the beach. Oy, was I frustrated with nothing left to read & another night & afternoon left. Lesson learned: must bring charger everywhere! Lost 1 * for this.I'm not a fan of touch screens, still love my trusty push-button cellphone. So browsing the web was a pain for me, having to navigate around the screen with my finger. Page turning was fine, but I think I've overdone it since my finger began stinging from constant page-turning friction :0)). Scrolling down & up also frustrates me - most of the time I have to swipe several times to get it to move. Not to mention hitting the back button after book downloads - the response time was slow which made me think it didn't sense my touch, so I'd do it again & it goes back all the way to the main menu. Grrr! What a pain as I have to restart the store search & find the page again.B&N; samples are horrible! They give you 7 pages...but it's the cover, copyright, dedication page with only a paragraph of the actual story. Not enough to make me want to buy a book. The closest B&N; is 1 hour drive away so I couldn't take advantage of the cafe freebies or free reading in-store.After I discovered that I cannot organize books into folders, that was the final straw. I read novels with racy titles, my 10 y.o. son wanted to read his classics on the nook but I didn't want to lend it to him because he would see all my books & potentially read them.

It's very irritating since I have to go back to the main menu and go to search and begin typing the book again.

I think that both the Nook and Kindle are good products, but the Nook offers the user some unique advantages over its counterpart--the Kindle. First, a buyer can actually test drive the Nook before purchasing it at either Best Buy or at a Barnes and Noble store. The Kindle is only available on line at Amazon.com.  I cannot invest my hard earned money into buying an electronic device without trying it out first. The physical design of the Nook is attractive, sturdy, and compact. Navigating is easy. The user does not have to use the left/right arrows on the Nook to turn the page of an ebook.  The pages of a book can be easily turned by simply swiping the touch screen. Bookmarks can also be set. This is an important feature for me since I tend to read more than one book at a time. Secondly, the Nook offers web browsing.  I was able to link my Nook to my home wireless network and surf web pages.  Although the software is still in its beta stages, I am impressed at what I can already do.  Next, I can download and/or design wallpapers and screensavers for the Nook. This might be a minor point, but it makes the Nook unique and customizable for its owner. The Nook's storage capacity can be expanded. The Nook comes with 2GB of storage that the user can expand up to 16GB by purchasing and installing a micro SD card. The Nook's internal battery lasts about five years with normal use (this is according to technical reviewers), and a replacement battery can be purchased and installed by the user. Nook users also have a community forum they can join on the Barnes and Noble website to share ideas, tips, and news about the Nook. Also, improvements in the Nook software updates are due to customer input. I like for my suggestions to be heard and the Nook engineering team is listening. Don't take my word for it.

Why?  3G is free (no monthly fee), so you may download books anywhere- whether wi-fi is available or not.  The Nook is not for everyone- for example, the web browser is cumbersome, however, I believe that an e-reader is not a jack-of-all-trades.  It should allow you to do one thing- READ BOOKS.  I Love the quality of the display, page turn speed, available literature, and free books online.  The thing that got me interested in the Nook is its compatibility with EPUB.  There are so many free EPUB books online and at the library.  With Kindle, that is not an option.I believe that with technology, glitches sometimes occur, and I respect the fact that when problems arise, they have excellent support.  I did have some difficulty with my device.  After about 6 months, the display stopped working properly.  Barnes and Noble quickly rectified the situation at no cost to me.  They gave me a gift card for my trouble.  Every time I have had technical questions regarding downloading books, the customer service representatives have answered all my questions.I must add that the color Nook does not have 3G, so I would definitely recommend the wifi-3G model, especially if you read a lot of novels.

Biggest waste of money I ever spent.  not worth the hassle of getting it repaired.  Made me miserable and unhappy for three days.  This is not how I want to spend my life--feeling miserable and abused and wondering how I got suckered into this huge mistake.The good--or perhaps the OK--I found nothing really good.GSM service is free for purchasing books and most uses. Not all that valuable.  I'd be happy with just WiFi and enough memory to carry around a personal library. with me.  GSM available for anything else but books.  Wifi works ok, after some fussing with the settings.  Many times I got error messages.  I kept trying until it worked.  There is some issue with the Wifi but it can be fussed with until it works--starting and stopping it.The bad--just about everything:I travel a lot, and need to carry my library with me.  This device does not work to download books outside of the US.  Why not?  I can understand the GSM not working, but if I have WiFi access somewhere, I should be able to load anything I want anywhere.  I can load books anywhere with my iPod Touch. Requires a US address.  Why?  Why can't anyone use it?  Device requires that you sign up with B&N; with a credit card.  Why can't I download free books without a B&N; account?  You cannot use this device until it is registered.This device is barely functional.  The interface is poorly designed, B&N; does a great job of making it difficult to find free books, and the books that are normally free--B&N; charges you $1 to $2 for these books! Outrageous!  Most people would not have a clue they are being ripped off being charged for books in the public domain.The interface is so bad that everyone is hacking these devices to make them functional.  Do a GOOGLE search for nook soft root--better yet check out YouTube and search for TROOK.Do a search on nook itself for free and you won't find free books, you will find books with ""free"" in the title or crippled editions with two chapters free.  There is no menu selection for find free books.  If you do find a free book it will be after wading through page after page of the same title--it would take days to find even a few interesting free books.  With the Kindle, at least you get to choose a few best sellers are part of your purchase price.  The B&N; give you nothing for free but garbage.  They want to frustrated enough to pay them more money for overpriced books.  Personally I can't see paying the same price for an electronic book as I do a paper bound book that I can resell or give as a gift.  Electronic books cost nothing to produce and distribute--why do they cost so much?  It is gouging, IMHO.To get a free book into your nook is a nightmare PITA.  I use an iPod Touch and was able to load 60 free books into it, in about 8 minutes--easy and simple.  Not menu after menu and then find out the book was not loaded after all.With B&N; nook it takes a long time to select and load a book.  You have to pay for a book, even if it is zero dollars--another menu choice, just to get you in the habit of hitting a purchase button.  There are lots of free books out there.  Why should it be hard to load these? Personally, I want a large library with me because I travel alot, and I want to find  what I want quickly, and I want to read it without hassle.PFD files can be loaded but these are not re-sized, so that type is pretty small and hard to read.  I can't read them, and I have reasonably good near vision.  If you are young with perfect vision you might be able to read for a while until your eyes get tired.  PDF don't work well on this device.Changing a page is a pain with the controls.  There is a way to use a finger swipe that some people have difficulty with.I personally hate wading through 40-60 pages on the life of the author, at the beginning of the book when all I want to do is read the book itself.  Books with a ton of crap in the front, with articles about the life of the author, acknowledgments, are a PITA toget around.  Scrolling down to chapter one to start the book is problematic--sometimes you are sent back to the index, other times you go to Chapter one. Why should I have to scroll and enter a command twice.  Why can't it work the first time?I constantly had the urge to use the white part of the device as a touch screen, but only the bottom is a touch screen.  I found myself thinking, my iPod Touch is better than this.  It is fast to touch what I want.  Give me something better like a Blackberry pointer ball!Display is flashing every time a page is changed.  I found this constantly annoying.  Why?  There is no reason for the flashing.  EVERY PAGE FLASHES AT YOU!  YOU WILL LEARN TO HATE IT!!!!USB power connector.  This is a weak spot of the device.  Instead of using a robust connector, they use a micro USB connector. It is wobbly. Even a mini-USB would have been better.  At times I  could not make this connector work.  It is delicate.  It doesn't want to mate up.  I found I needed to be very precise on aligning it, even then it would not connect.  I doubt that this will survive 100 re-connections.  If you buy this device, do not expect it to last more than two years.  It would be smart to get the extended warrantee--another $60 for two years--If you buy a nook.  Charge it only when you have too, or you will wear out this connector in a short period of time.  While the battery life is good, given the crappy connector, I don't understand why they didn't put a battery 2-3 times larger in this device so that the connector would last longer and have less wear.Memory Storage is limited to about 1GB with space to add another memory card.  To bring it up to 8 or 16 GB, it will cost you another $30 to $60, or if you buy it from B&N; it will be twice as much.  I feel the device is worthless without at least another 8GB of storage.  I'd rather it came with another 16GB.  The iPad comes with that much or more--so you get a color full touch screen for not much more than the cost of the memory you need.This is a good gift for someone clueless about electronics that won't know any better about how badly B&N; crippled their android operating system and don't understand what a good interface is all about.Do yourself a favor.  Try an iPod Touch, and I assume the iPad works as well.  Apple makes quality products that work right, with strong connectors, great software, and are backed up with the highest rated customer support.  B&N; built something with one purpose only, to sell electronic books--and to make it difficult to find free books, and to break quickly.  If you want to be screwwed over, buy one of these and then bend over because B&N; sees you as someone to be used and abused--not a valuable customer.If B&N; made it easy to download free books, I'd be more forgiving on the crappy software they use and the delicate power connector.  If B&N; made a decent, usable interface, and made it easy to load whole library's of free books, I'd probably buy some electronic books and they would earn my business.  As it is, I will never buy an e-Book or any other book from B&N.;  That is how angry I am about wasting money on this product.My nook is dead after only three days.  I wish I could return it.  I don't have the original packaging either, so that even if I got a new replacement, I cannot sell it on eBay to get my money back.  I'm not sure what I'll do.  I will be calling B&N; tomorrow to see about a replacement, and begging for a store credit instead so I can buy an iPad instead.The bottom line is, I'm more than disappointed about the product.  I'm angry enough that I'll never do business with B&N; again--even if they refund me the price of this device.  I don't even want it back if it were repaired.I'd rather pay $600 for an iPad, purchasing from a company that charges a lot for products that are well thought out and work well.  While I may wish the price was less for Apple products, at least I don't have this awful feeling of being screwwed ten different ways by B&N; with their service and nook product.For those who think this is a good product.

Page turning is faster than I can turn a page in a book.  I also really like being able to change the font size.A lot of people seem to overlook the extras that come with the Nook.  For example, every time I went to B&N; in May, I got a free ""seven layer bar"" from the cafe.  All I had to do was show them the coupon on my Nook.  I didn't even have to buy another item.  I love free food.  I went to the same B&N; three times in a week, and they accepted the coupon each time.  This month, the nook gives me a 10% off coupon.  I expect that each month there will be a coupon to use.Furthermore, the read in store function is very nice.  If you are looking to read a book, but B&N; doesn't have it in store, you can likely find it on the Nook and read it for free.Battery life is great.  It will last me a week or so with Wi-Fi left on.One of the reasons I chose the Nook over the Kindle was because of the native PDF support.  I just load the PDF onto my Nook.  This is another reason why the SD card functionality is very useful, in case you have a lot of PDFs.I wish, however, that the Nook had a zoom function for PDFs.  Sometimes, when a page comes out as a single picture, it can be difficult to read.Also, while the touch screen interface is easy to use, I would prefer up and down hard keys to move through the menu.  Not a big deal at all, but I think up down left right motion in a menu should always have a hard key.  (I really like the Sony's keys along the side of the screen, I think that was a great idea.)Overall, I'm really happy with my purchase, and I expect the Nook to pay for itself with the discounts on books and free food from the cafe.Edit: I've had the nook over a year now.  I still use it at least once a week.  The battery life and the page turning have been drastically improved by the ios update.The one problem I had was with a line of dead pixels in the nook.  They just wouldn't change correctly with the rest of the screen.  I called B&N; customer service, and they shipped out a replacement free of charge.  I just had to send my original one back.Best thing about the Nook:  The free books on Fridays.  I've been quite pleased with most of these books, and they have kept me busy for free!  I would highly recommend getting a reconditioned Nook.  We just bought my wife's mom one for under $90 (wi-fi only) off of B&N;'s official ebay.My wife and I bought it to share, but I liked it so much I use it exclusively.

I went back and forth between Amazon's Kindle and B&N's NOOK.  The thing that sold me on the NOOK was the ability to download books from other sources than just Amazon.  I can download books from my local library, Google Books, along with Barnes & Noble's selection of over 2 million books they offer.  The ability to download any ePub and PDF files is a plus.  I like the touch pad vs. keyboard on Kindle.  It took a little getting used to as it is very touch sensitive, but once I got the hang of it, it is a smooth way to navigate.  One of the criticisms of NOOK has been some sluggishness with the NOOK, which I have maybe a tiny bit of, but we're talking maybe a second or so, so it is no big deal really.  There have been many criticisms about the battery life of the NOOK, but to me it's a minor thing as all I have to do is plug it in about every 4 or 5 days if I use my NOOK excessively.  It lasts longer if the WiFi is turned off.  I can go a week without having to recharge it then.  I also like the ability to replace the battery myself rather than having to send the the entire Kindle in to have it replaced.  One of the nicest features of the NOOK is being able to go into my local B&N bookstore and talking to a real live person if I have any questions or have any problem with my NOOK.  B&N has NOOK stations right in their stores with people who are there to answer questions or help with problems you may encounter.  They are very helpful.

Glitz does not equal function, as I promptly found out.To be fair to Nook, if ALL you want to do is read, the device works, and works pleasantly.  I received my Nook in February, so it had the latest firmware updates, and I experienced none of the delays in downloading, missed sections of books, delays in page turning that early reports noted.  But if I was attempting to do anything more than clicking the page turning buttons, OUCH!The nifty little full color touchscreen (NOT to be confused with the e-paper reading screen, which is permanently gray-scale) just can't do it's job.  It responds slowly and inconsistently to touch, is quirky in its response, and virtually (no pun intended) unusable.  The virtual keyboard:  what a nightmare.  It's a true challenge to type more than one or two words without making an error, and trying to fix that error degenerates into a tragi-comedy in short order.The unit itself is pleasant to the hand, and comfortable.  It's also darn slick in its appearance, and if aesthetics  are your only criteria, well, go for it.  But here is why I returned the Nook after one week:  any optional feature, such as bookmarking, highlighting text and annotating it, search functions for previous book marks and annotations:  purely a nightmare.  The processor of the Nook appears to be vastly underpowered, and each instruction you give the touchscreen results in a wait that seems interminable.  It took me 30 seconds, AFTER I got good at it, to highlight 3 lines at the bottom of a page.  Simply not acceptable.Battery life:  might have just been my own unit, but in 7 hours: dead.  I also experienced two full scale lockups, with all buttons simply refusing to work for several minutes.The Nook's only advantage, as far as I can tell, is access to significantly more free content than you can currently access on Kindle.  Not worth the incredible frustration of wrestling with a device that went for touchscreen technology, but forgot that the touchscreen needs to be FUNCTIONAL before you bring it to market.Update as of 2/11/2010:  I purchased a Kindle after returning my Nook, and have been using it for three days.  Wow.  What an incredible difference in terms of ease of use.  The keyboard is very functional, bookmarking and note taking is effortless, the dictionary function (move the cursor to a word, instantly a definition pops up) is wonderful. Battery consumption is imperceptible, after 3 day, no visible drain (my Nook lasted 7 hours).  Downside of the Kindle?  Books whose copyright had expired (e.g. Wuthering Heights)that were FREE on Nook, are 99 cents on Kindle.  Nook lists all vendors of a given book, with prices conveniently visible, Kindle does not.  Irritating.  Lastly, Nook had a tiny clock in a corner of the screen, which I found very useful.  Not available on Kindle.

With all the buzz, I, of course, ran out to BN to see the Nook when it first came out and was incredibly disappointed at that time as it was painfully sluggish and I had almost crossed it off my list for purchase. However, I went back and saw it again at the store after about 6 weeks from my first viewing and what a difference! Barnes and Noble has made great strides. A friend showed me her Kindle and I got to play with it and I looked in stores and saw the Sony reader as well. Did MUCH research online as well on some of the others such as Jetbook Lite.As much as I LOVE Amazon and shop here more often than I probably should LOL. I decided on the Nook seeing the improvements that were already made in that short amount of time. What sealed the deal for me was the SD card option to expand memory AND you can change the battery yourself as opposed to having to send your device back over a simple battery change.I am not regretting my decision to go with the Nook at all. I have to admit that it did freeze up on me twice, BUT it only did that when I interrupted the charging process. So, I don't know exactly what caused that. No problems at all while reading. As far as reading on the Nook, its a great device. Downloading books is fast and simple to do. Page turning is fast now. Its a dream come true for an avid reader like me.The only con that I've noticed so far is battery life. I think its a huge stretch to say the battery lasts 10 days. However, the wi-fi turns itself off after being idle for a minute or so, so you don't have to manually turn it off. When you activate the menu, it will reconnect to the network. So, BN is making an effort to increase battery life without much manual interaction.I highly recommend the Nook. With BN updates coming as quick as they are, I think this device is proving to be THE superior ereader.",5.0,Giving other readers a run for their money,1265673600,"02 9, 2010",Electronics,1.0

Woehr,"[194, 199]","Despite all of the negative reviews, I decided to take a chance and buy the nook, once I tested it out at my local B&N.; I loved the look and feel of this device and was looking forward to the convenience of buying more books without adding more clutter to my already cluttered bookcases. I read all of the pros and cons of owning a Kindle and compared it to the pros and cons of owning a nook. The nook won because of its versatility (epub format, book lending, etc).My nook arrived on January 28th. Since then, I've experienced one crash and had to figure out how to use the touchscreen so that I can flip the pages without having to use the arrow keys. The latter took some practice, but I eventually mastered it and have been enjoying this feature ever since. I've also read three books in the space of a week, which is a personal record for me, as it normally takes two weeks for me to read a single paperback, longer if I'm reading an ebook on an LCD screen.The eInk technology is fabulous. I can read all day (and do) without eyestrain. The letters are very crisp on a plain white background. Even better, you can adjust the font size from small to extra large. Not only that but the nook comes with several fonts: Amasis, Helvetica Neue and Light Classic. I'm happy with the Amasis as it resembles Times Roman.My only complaint so far is that I am not able to categorize my books into categories. At the moment, I'm forced to wade through my list until I find the book that I want to read. B&N; has already sent out an update, which is a good improvement over the old interface. While the touch interface can be a bit buggy (Sometimes you have to flick your finger more than once or use the arrow keys to turn the page.), I can turn pages in one second compared to the 2-3 seconds it would take with the original software. That wasn't a big deal until I received the upgrade.I also like what they've done with the bookmarks feature. Before, they had a strange numerical format for bookmarks. With this upgrade, it lists the page that you bookmarked, which is much nicer.I love how I can download samples of ebooks directly from my nook without having to rely on the B&N; site to do everything. Once you finish the sample, you have the option to buy. If you decide to buy the book, you will be taken to the last page you read so that you can continue from there. You can also archive the books that you've read directly from your nook with the press of a button, which helps manage your list.Sideloading my pdf ebooks onto my nook was an easy experience. However, you can't categorize your documents; you can only sort them by title or author.Another great aspect of owning a nook is that you can check out ebooks from your local libraries (see [...] for a list of libraries near you), sideload books that you have bought from Fictionwise and other ebook stores, and download free ebooks from either the B&N; site or Google Books. That's what ultimately sold me on the nook, the versatility and freedom to choose where I want to buy or download free ebooks. The nook is not proprietary, unlike the Kindle and the soon-to-be-released iPad.The interface is very easy to use. It comes with a manual that you can read on the device, or on the B&N; website. If you're still stuck on an issue, I found this great forum ([...]) with friendly people who can help you.I've yet to check out the Lend feature because my family and friends have yet to embrace this technology.Other than my issue with organization, I am really enjoying my nook. I'm looking forward to reading many books in the future, thanks to this wonderful device. Highly recommended.Side note: I agree with S. Dayton about the iPad. After reading a few ebooks on my iTouch and my Mac, I have to agree with him about the eyestrain. For casual surfing and watching video, LCD works fine. But for longterm reading, eInk is the way to go.",4.0,"Very Good, Despite Its Quirks",1265587200,"02 8, 2010",Electronics,1.0

But I know that I can always add space with the memory card when/if I ever need to.I have only 1 slight problem with it.  It doesn't have a background light.  I bought an attachable light and so now that's not a problem.  But I understand now why not having that light is a blessing.  The other day I was reading from my PDA that has a background light.  I was waiting in the car and had to shade the screen with my hand to see the text.  I pulled out the nook and it wasn't a problem.And the color touch screen is great too.  I waited and waited for Sony or Amazon to add color to theirs.  That was in vain.  You don't know how much you appreciate color until tis gone.  It's like Dorothy waking up in Oz.

{'$oid': '5a13242d741a2384e88f4806'},A3K63SBTVYUQPK,1400599997,Dave Snell,"[7, 8]","I have to admit, I got off to a very bad start with my Nook. I bought it at the local Barnes and Noble (BN) store, after trying the store demo unit. It was missing some of the features I was assured would be on my purchased unit. It seems that the store demo units are attached to a limited account, so they can't download even the free samples of books. My local store doesn't stock the Nook, and does not expect to anytime soon; but a sales associate checked the BN internal website and proudly exclaimed that they are fully stocked and there are no more wait times for delivery. I placed my order and paid for it right away. This was a Thursday and the Nook arrived the following Wednesday. In contrast, each of the four Kindles our family has purchased has arrived within two days.Anyway, getting back to the store experience, three sales associates tried to show me the wonderful features of the Nook; but none of them seemed to know any more than I did from my online reading about it - and one had bought one! They all had heard that the Kindle does not handle PDFs and they were surprised when I showed them that mine reads them easily. Additionally, since PDFs with small print are often hard to read in their native format, Amazon provides a free conversion service to true Kindle format. That way you can increase the font size - a problem I later discovered on many of my PDFs once I got them on the Nook.One sales associate actually had the naivet&eacute; to say that a big plus of the Nook over the Kindle was that if I had a problem or wanted to know how to do anything I could just come into the store and they could help me. This was the same associate who could not answer my question about folders. In contrast, when I had a question about the new system software upgrade on my daughter's Kindle, I called on Christmas Day, had no wait because they overstaffed for the holidays, and got a customer service representative who was incredibly helpful and stayed on the line with me to make sure that the upgrade worked as stated. I have sent three emails to the Nook customer service address and had no response yet to any of them after 4 days.The Nook has the worst overkill I have ever seen on packaging. I was so frustrated trying to get it out of the shipping container meant to protect it, that I almost damaged it myself. Ironically, I mentioned to my wife that there ought to be a set of instructions to unpack it; then voila! I found a set of detailed instructions about how to unpack it. Even with the two pages of unpacking instructions I found this to be a tedious task that requires a nontrivial amount of dexterity and strength in the fingers. You have to experience it to believe it. This is not an environmentally conscious packaging affair.Next I had to register my Nook before using it. This meant having to set up a BN account online with an email address, a password and a credit card. When my Kindle arrived, it was ready to go because they kept the information at time of purchase (you can change these default options whenever you wish) and the unit comes prepared for you.So far, I have not even mentioned the performance of the Nook yet. That was the next disappointment. It is slow. It is very slow. Mine takes more than 30 seconds just to turn on and let you try to read something. The Kindle takes about three seconds, which I used to think was slow.One difference you notice right away is that the Nook looks impressive because it has a color panel below the reading display. This is in place of the keyboard and joy stick on the Kindle. The color panel is a novelty but does not add much functionality. It is also a clumsy way to navigate. I found myself pressing the wrong line several times because they were crammed together. On the Kindle, a mistake is not a big deal; but on the Nook it can mean a long wait before you can correct it. The software is agonizingly slow.Later, I made a major mistake. I linked the Nook to my PC and naively copied over 45 PDF documents (about 250 MB total) that I have on my Kindle. On the Kindle, once I copied them to the Kindle drive they were available. On the Nook, I created a disaster. The Nook gave a messageChecking for New ItemsThis will only take a moment.Four hours later, I still did not have use of the Nook. Apparently, Nook moments are not the same as regular moments. At this rate one dog year could be several Nook years.Admitting my error, I reconnected to the PC and deleted every PDF over a megabyte in size. Then, the Nook was able to show me my library again. Note that while I was not able to see my own library of PDFs, I was also not able to see my library of BN books. The exception was that I could press Reading Now and get into the last BN book I was reading (but could not switch to another one). Of course, it soon froze and I was forced to wait until the Nook did whatever conversion it does to read my PDFs.Realizing now that the Nook is NOT good for large PDF documents (I have many that are 20 MB or more) I have to say that it seems to work well for smaller ones. The font is changeable in some documents (but not all - not quite sure why) and the screen display is about as crisp as that of my Kindle (same technology). Another annoyance I found was that the names of my PDF books and documents were changed in the directory. Apparently, the conversion process tries to determine the name from the internals of the PDF; but I have renamed many of my files to make them more easily readable on an electronic reader table of contents; and the Nook overrides my names. The Kindle2 respects them, which I prefer. I tried to bring over another PDF over 20 MB and it tried 12 hours but could not convert it to Nook format or whatever it does with PDFs. Whenever I tried to check on progress, I got the now familiar ""Checking for New Items ... This will only take a moment.""My next disappointment was the folders. One of the main reasons I wanted a Nook was that I have over 200 documents on my Kindle2 and I don't like having to scroll through 20 or more screens to find the book I want to read. I was told that the Nook allows you to organize your work into folders.Although it is true that I could make folders under the My Documents folder on the Nook, everything in them showed up on the documents list as though they were not in folders at all. The truth seems to be that the Nook gives you two folders: My B&N; Library, and My Documents. I guess that two is better than one; but I was hoping for many more, and the ability to make them at my own discretion. You can organize them into as many folders as you wish on the PC, as you can with the Kindle; but that does not change your visual experience on the Nook (or on the Kindle).This review is obviously biased because I really like my Kindles; but in fairness, there are some things I like about the Nook.I pulled off the back cover and verified that I can add a MicroSD card and even replace the battery. Given the wonderful service I get from Amazon, the idea of sending the unit back for a battery replacement does not worry me; but it still might be nice to have the option for an in-field replacement. The Nook battery is a proprietary type so I doubt there would be a large cost difference between the two anyway. I have ordered a MicroSD card (from Amazon, of course) and I'll see what impact that has on the battery life (already seeming short to me - a few days at most) after I install it.I also like the ability to replace the wallpaper and screensavers with my own pictures. Admittedly, it's just a frill; but a nice one. I liked it so much that I downloaded the Kindle hack for this from [...] so I now have that feature on my Kindles. Many thanks to Nook for showing me this idea. Another nice feature is the rubberized back cover. My Kindle has a tendency to slide and I have to be more careful where I place it. There are lots of fancy cases and sleeves for the Kindle and the Nook, but so far I prefer the slimness of the units by themselves. Either one can fit into a cargo pants pocket. The Nook is a better fit, although it is also a little heavier.Regarding the reading, the ability to change fonts (sometimes) is nice but I don't feel much need to do that. That hack is also available on the website I referenced earlier. I do, however, often change the font size. In lower light conditions, I need a larger font than in bright light. I compared the font ranges between the two units and the Kindle largest font is noticeably larger than the Nook largest font. That may be a factor for people with impaired vision. One friend bought a Kindle just to get larger print than she can get in most large print books.I am partial to the navigation on the Kindle; but that may be from the long exposure. I especially like the word lookup feature of the Kindle, where just moving the cursor over a word gives a quick definition and then pressing the enter key gives a more complete one, as well as the ability to browse through the neighboring words. The Nook word lookup was slow and less flexible.I make a lot of highlights in my electronic books as I read them. This is fast and easy on the Kindle2. It not fast, nor is it easy on the Nook. Several times, I lost my highlight or note by pressing a nearby spot on the tiny touch panel. I prefer having a joystick that does what I want without the need to be so dainty and precise with my finger tips. I was not able to make highlights or notes in PDF documents on the Nook. In the local store they said it cannot be done. Of course, I send most of my PDF docs to the free Kindle site for conversion to native format and then I have this capability.Another big marketing draw for the Nook seems to be the access to many more books. I was finding the reverse to be the case. Project Gutenberg [...] and similar sites have many books available for free that correspond to the free Google books on the Nook. However, most of the books I want are technical and more current than 50 plus years ago, and I found the Amazon Kindle library more likely to have the book I want than the BN Nook library. In the cases where both have the same book available, I sometimes see the Amazon price as slightly cheaper; but I have yet to see the reverse.OK, after all of these complaints, you must be wondering why I would rate this as four stars. I am trying hard to give the BN folks the benefit of the doubt here. I understand that the Nook is still new; but already they have shipped out two major software upgrades, so I see good intentions. The earliest Kindles were not so impressive either; and I still look forward to more enhancements such as true folder viewing capability and a zoom capability for pictures. Furthermore, I want to encourage people to get an electronic reader. Even though they are not as well designed and debugged as I would wish, they are a huge step forward from having to carry around the dozen or so books I tend to read at a time. As of today, 21-Feb-2010 (software version 1.2.0), I would rank the Kindle much higher than the Nook. The gap ought to narrow over the next several months; but either one is a big improvement over eReaders of the past, and either one is affordable. Buy a Kindle; or if you have some obsession with color touch pads (I don't) then buy a Nook. Don't just sit around and read countless reviews hoping to get the best possible unit. Get started with either one today. You will become a far more knowledgeable eReader consumer and you will enjoy the pleasure of more time reading books and less effort carrying them.",4.0,Four stars for future potential - only two or three stars for performance as of version software 1.2.0,1266796800,"02 22, 2010",Electronics,1.0

It had really came down to these main criterion for my purchase:1. Is it simple and easy to get books online, does it use a book buying web format I am accustomed to?2. Will I make back some of my investment on the device by deals on ebooks?3. Is it simple and fun to use, comfortable to hold, and do I look cool using it?4. Can I test drive before I buy?Some of the things I was not concerned with were:1. Listening to music, audio books and being read to.2. Name brand of device.The Nook won out for several reasons.  First, at the time I was buying it (February 2010) Barnes and Noble ebooks were actually the same price or slightly cheaper then Amazon's.  This was the case for many of the books I was most interested in reading (leisure reading).  I also was already familiar with Barnes and Nobles website's format and functionality (the way the colored touch screen interfaced with their website was really visually pleasing).  I also like to mull around in Barnes and Noble stores, and liked the feature that you can read books for free (for an hour) while in a store.  I also like that you can lend books to other Nook owners.  Second, I have already recooped the cost of my Nook in what I have saved on books.  I like to read classics, and now I can read them for free on my Nook.  Downloading them is very easy.  I also have found websites online for discounted books, some that are mainstream authors, some are not, but all are amusing to read.  The EPub format that the Nook uses is pretty common and it is easy to convert pdf's and other ebook types to EPUB using free programs like Calibre. Third, I liked the software that the Nook uses in comparison to the Kindle.  Although I have not done this myself, apparently you can illegally hack your Nook and get a chat program to work, or a facebook thing etc.  Again, I have not done it (and NO ONE should ever do that because it voids your warrenty and can destroy your device), but I like the idea that you can do more things with their OS.  To me it means that one day Barnes and Noble may make the device legally capable of doing more then just reading/downloading books, and I think that is great!  Finally, the selling point for me was going to a Barnes and Noble store and being able to hold a Nook and read a few pages and test it out.  It felt so good in my hands, and had a nice weight to it, with sharp text and a smooth modern case.Of course there are some strange things about the Nook, i.e. sometimes a book takes a little long to load etc.  However, the majority of your time is spent reading and turning pages, and I have had hardly any issues with that.  Battery life is all it needs to be, it lasts long enough that charging it is not a hassle.  I have not tried any audio books or music on it.  I have an Ipod for things like that, and honeslty do not understand how someone could read and listen to music at the same time.  Even after all these months, I have not once wanted my Nook to play music or read me a book, reading by itself has just been so great.  Since getting the Nook, I have somehow managed to read much more then I ever have before. Probably that is due to having a library at my fingertips, so I can read whatever I am in the mood for, it is easy to take everywhere, and it is quick to get a book.  As far as quality of a device goes, my friends with other ereaders of a lesser quality say that the Nook has very sharp and dark text in comparison to what they have (older ereaders or cheaper devices).  However, that is because of the quality of the device, not brand name.----Update---- 11/8/2010 -----I have had my Nook for several months now, and I am still in love with it.  I have about 200 books on it, most of them free from google or other websites.  I am reading more than I have ever read before in my life, and without leaving the trail of hundreds discarded paperbacks in my wake.  The Nook recently did a massive update and now it has games and can surf the internet.  I have not had any hardware issues with it, even loading tons of documents onto it all at once caused no freezing.  The battery life still lasts for several days (with wireless off).  I have no buyers remorse, even after the price dropped and even after they came out with the Nook color, I still feel like my purchase was worth every penny because I got to enjoy it for months before the price went down, and it is still a high quality item.  I highly recommend if you are deciding between the Nook and another device to try it before you buy it.  Go to a Barnes and Noble and try a Nook, AND go to a Target or a Best Buy (they have Kindles... but from what I have seen they are not powered on and usually are beat up) and try holding a Kindle.

She loves it and uses it more than any other gift I ever purchased her. She was having so much fun with it I decided to get an ereader for myself but I was drawn more toward the Nook. I read so many bad reviews about the Nook I wasn't sure if I should get it or a Kindle or maybe something different with a touch screen and wireless connection. I thought about it for a few weeks and noticed that the reviews started getting better. I decided to go for it. I ordered it last Wednesday from B&N; and received it 2 days later. I am so happy I did. I didn't experience any of the the negatives I read about with exception that battery could stay charged longer. Talking about the battery, it's nice to know that you can change it yourself and at a much lessor expense than with a Kindle. I'll probably never need it but it's also nice to be able to add a memory card to hold more content. And the Nook just looks nicer in my opinion.The new update was released the same day I received my Nook and I updated the firmware the second day I had it and it runs even more smoother.

This policy creates a lot of the problems.1) I don't feel the books are mine. I paid for them. I should have full access to them.2) If I buy a reader for one of my kids, they could download books and I wouldn't know until I got a bill (gift cards do not qualify as an active credit card) and B & N has a strict no refund policy on ebooks.3) Requiring me to keep I credit card on file should be an invasion of my privacy.4) What happens if I replace my Nook with a non-B & N reader?

I bought the Nook for these reasons: 1) It reads industry-standard ePub-format ebooks, 2) it's tightly integrated with the B&N; ebook store, 3) the ebooks are encrypted in a well-documented easily-understood format that is portable across multiple devices so they can be decrypted and read in, say, your iPad's Nook reader software, or even in a Sony Reader (with the very latest firmware), without having to be re-purchased because of DRM nonsense.The problem is that the Nook simply doesn't live up to its promise. The ""paper-white"" display is more an off-beige, and reflects light in a way that makes it hard to read with a reading light (necessary because it has no backlight, as is true for all ePaper devices). It's heavy and the buttons to change pages are hard to push, especially with gloved hands as you might have while reading outdoors on a cool day. The ""5 day battery life"" in reality for me has been a 1-day battery life, read a book, and it needs to be recharged, and be darn sure to turn it off. The thing freezes up and crashes all the time even with the very latest software, and is excruciatingly slow even with the very latest software. The latest software added classifications for the ebooks so you could sort them into pseudo-folders, which is necessary given how excruciatingly slow the Nook is to scroll through its book list (get about 50 books on the list and you're in for major pain), but the clunky way they implemented this makes those of us who've gotten used to modern user interfaces frown and shake our heads.Sad to say, I really can't recommend any current eBook reader. Either they're too clumsy to use (Nook), have no books available for them (Sony), or have a proprietary eBook format that locks you into a single vendor (Kindle). I'm seriously considering buying an iPad, yes, it will only work for 9 hours or so on a battery charge, but that's true of the Nook too in real actual use and the iPad is usable for a lot of other things too. It's just disappointing that I can't get an ePaper-based reader that meets my criteria (non-proprietary ebook format, long battery life, compact, decent user interface), and instead have things either crippled by bad design decisions or crippled by having a proprietary ebook format that locks you into a single vendor. Well, I don't like crippled, so I'll look elsewhere, thank you very much...",2.0,Disappointing,1290988800,"11 29, 2010",Electronics,0.0

I just carefully read all of the negative reviews. There is so much mis-information in those posts you can only come to one conclusion. I would say most of these reviews are staged. Unfortunately fanboys of products love to use their anonymity of the Internet to drag down the competition. Before you beLIEve what you read here, go to a Barnes and Noble store and you can actually hold and use a demo unit. If you are still in doubt of the nook, simply vist the Kindle Boards forums, you can Google it. They have a board ""Other eReaders"" and read the positive raves about the nook from actual Kindle owners.)I can tell you the Nook I just purchased came with release 1.2 and it absolutely rocks!One of my Co-workers loaned me his Kindle 2 for a couple of hours so I could get a feel for both devices before I made my decision to purchase. I am not going to bad mouth the Kindle 2 as I am sure it is a fine device. My decision to buy the Nook was based on a few key features I thought important enough to sway me one way over the other.While in the B&N; store, I immediately fell in love with the very intuitive and responsive touch navigation. It just feels natural. I did not even have to look at instructions or guides to figure out how to use the Nook. Great job on the UI design.After my purchase, I immediately opened the Nook while in store and the device simply connected to the B&N; hotspot without user interaction (NICE!). Since I already have a B&N; account from the many books I have ordered online, my registration literally took 30 seconds. I just signed in and it was done.I was so excited, I purchased a book while in the store and sat down and began to read. Since my card info is already stored, buying was a breeze! I just clicked purchase and confirmed, nothing else. My book was available almost immediately.The Nook feels to be a very solidly built device. The screen size is large and the font is crystal clear. I wish it would have come with a protective case, but while I am here on Amazon...(Key feature in decision to purchase the Nook) Wi-Fi! I am so happy that included Wi-Fi and not just AT&Ts; 3G network. We have very spotty cellular coverage in our area. Including Wi-Fi just seems like a no brainer. (Don't worry Kindle fans, I sure it will be included in the K3)(Key feature in decision to purchase the Nook) Expandable Memory. By trade I am a Network Engineer and carry loads of .pdf technical reference guides with me on my Notebook computer. It will be nice to have them at my fingertips.(Key feature in decision to purchase the Nook) LendMe - The LendMe feature allows you to lend books to other Nook owner for up to 2 weeks. Sweet!(Key feature in decision to purchase the Nook) The Nook has a replaceable battery. Why wouldn't that be included in the design of the Kindle beats me. Having to ship the unit back and pay $59? I don't get it.Miner points that affected my buying decisionKnow the device has the Android OS is a plus. I have found my Android based cell phone is very stable and customizable.The personalized screensaver is nice.If you are shopping for an eReader I think either way you go, Nook, Kindle, Sony, etc. eReaders are fun and take reading to the next level.

I even went to the store and tested the nook, played with it. I went to other stores that had other e readers and looked at them as well. Then one of my coworkers showed me her Kindle and I was able to play with it and look at it.Then the i pad came out, So I went to the store and looked at the i pad and played with it as well. I have read review after review and watched you-tube...Well The holidays came and my husband bought me the Nook!!! I was so excited! I wanted the Nook as soon as I saw it, but took my time and compared it to other e readers.. I knew right from the start which e reader I wanted after being in discussion with others about e readers and after looking and playing with a few of them.Right out of the box the Nook, made me happy and gave me confirmation of my long desire to own the Nook. My husband knew that I wanted it, but I waited trying to justify why I needed an e reader and to see if anyone of them would go beyond my expectations. The Nook did exactly that! For me the Nook was worth the money and time it took to decide on which one to purchase... Here is why I love the Nook, I can lend books to other, I can download from my library which is so awesome! I can surf the net for FREE!!!!!! no monthly fees like the i pad, It fits in my computer bag, purse, which makes it so easy to take with me, It has my favorite games, Chess and Sukodu! It was easy for me to download a ebook that I already have, but have been unable to read due to me not wanting to tote my lap top around, the book loaded right from my lap top to the Nook in no time... The amount of free books that are available to the Nook, and the daily free treats from Barnes And Nobles! Which will more than pay for the Nook over time. Being able to call Barnes and Nobles and talk to a live person over the phone and being able to walk in the store and get face to face customer service.I also like the fact that when you are in the store you can read ebooks for free for an hour and download more free ebooks! For me It was the right choice for our family, as when we go to Barnes and Nobles with our children we can stay longer now that we have the nook and can receive free treats and more free ebooks! It pays for itself... These are some of the reason why I love my nook and I am excited that I received the Nook for a gift! I can not say enough about the Nook, I don't have to be tied to one book store like Itunes, Ibook, are the Kindle store... I don't like limits and the Nook allows me to be free to choose where to get my books from...Now with that said, When I visited my local Barnes and Nobles and received a free smoothie, It was so stress free and everyone was so nice.. I could not believe it!I have also downloaded music that I can listen to and have my ear plugs for that, I have also downloaded several books which was so easy to download that I was shocked! I like getting my monies worth, and not having to pay extra monthly fees.Now with that said, I hope that when you do your research you will consider the Nook, I am surprised that there are not more reviews than the current number of reviews.

From the day it arrived at my house in January (because they were so far backordered) I haven't been more than 5 feet away from it at any given time. I take it everywhere I go, including work. I work at a store that sells the Kindle and often customers will try to ask me about it. I bring them to another associate because I don't know as much about the Kindle but I absolutely love my Nook, and this is why...1) I love to read, and there is nothing worse than finishing a great book that leaves off on a cliffhanger and you have to wait to get the next in the series. Having my Nook solves that problem. No matter where I am or what time it is, whether I'm home with my Wifi connection or out in the middle of the woods camping I can download a new book and never have to wait.2) The e-ink technology is so easy to read on, rather than trying to read LCD which strains your eyes after a while. I can (and have) read my Nook for hours upon hours at a time with no strain at all on my eyes.3) I can trade books with my friends. If I come across a book that I know my friend will love I can send it to her for her to borrow or she can lend me a book if she finds one I'll like.4) Having a web browser everywhere I go is great. I don't use the feature much, but it's really nice to know I can pop on and check whatever I want to check. The small touchscreen area on the bottom shows the area of the webpage you are looking at in color.5) Sudoku has saved me from boredom many times! When I just don't have enough time to get involved with a book I can open the games they offer and play a quick game.6) The touchscreen area on the bottom is a really nice add. It makes it so easy to flip through the books in your library while viewing the covers of the books, changes to a keyboard when you need to type, makes it quick and easy to buy books or change settings, and shows the web pages in your browser in full color.7) While it used to take about a second for the pages to change, with the new update the page changes are very near instant. By the time your eyes go from the bottom of the page to the top the page has changed.8) Bookshelves!! The new update also allows me to sort my books in shelves so I can organize them however I want and find specific titles easily.To this day I have only had 1 issue. The device froze and I had to manually reset it, which requires a process of taking out the battery and plugging it in. I had to do this about 2 months after I got it and it has been glitch/problem free since then.

I researched ALOT of ereaders before making the decision to buy the Nook; in fact, I originally bought a Kindle from a local store, but never took it out of the box, and returned it to purchase the Nook.I originally decided to go with the 3G for two reasons; 1) I wasn't sure I could set up my home wi-fi to work with the Nook, and 2) I wanted to be able to purchase books from absolutely anywhere.  And I've been glad I chose that; I have yet to purchase a book over just the wi-fi.  I was at a doctors office recently, waiting and waiting and waiting, and it was wonderful to be able to shop, buy a book, and start it while enduring the endless waiting.The customer service from Barnes and Noble is great, all I have to do is walk in the store with my Nook and the employees are knowledgable and helpful for helping with the Nook.  Also, the store nearest me has ""classes"" on Saturday afternoons for Nook/NookColor owners, and I found that to be very helpful when I first purchased my Nook.Speaking of the physical store, I also like that I can read any book for FREE for up to an hour a day in the store.  That gives me the opportunity to read alot more of a book than just what they provide as a ""free sample"" and lets me decide whether to purchase the book or not.I've looked at the newest generation Nook, which has just recently become available, and I'm glad I got my Nook when I did; I like it so much better than ANY ereader I've looked at.

I had a Sony PRS-505 that I sold on E-Bay in anticipation of loving the Nook. It was great, a few years old and I loved the possibilities of the Nook. From the bullet list of its ""features"" it is the ultimate device, reality is much different. After the 1.1.1 patch was installed, a patch that promised great improvements, here are my observations:The Bad:1. Battery life is grossly, I mean grossly overstated. They say 10 days in ""Airplane mode"", I'm going to be generous and say maybe, maybe two days-- if and only if you shorten the color display blank time, change pages by the button instead of swiping the touch screen, etc. as recommended for ""hypermiling"" the device. If you leave the wi-fi and wireless on and use the other default settings for blanking the display, the battery will deplete quickly enough that the battery display reads like an animation. It reminds me of an old 1968 four-barrel Cadillac Eldorado that gets 5 miles per gallon. You barely use it and it needs to be filled up again.2. The color screen used for navigation has tiny selection buttons that will cause you often to choose the wrong menu item. Also, some features that would have been better on a button or multi-directional switch require that you wake up the color screen and use it for navigation. For example, scroll up and down.3. The form factor was thick and clunky. Almost entirely made of plastic.4. Buggy software crashed and misbehaved, OFTEN.5. Free preview download of books often would not format correctly--- missing characters, centered text on one page, justified on another. Complete sentences cut off or missing, pages missing. Note: If you buy the book it would be formatted perfectly.6. Touch screen comes on and wastes battery if you accidentally touch it while reading7. Poster boy for frustration packaging.The Good:1. The E-Ink display on my Nook was higher contrast than my Sony PRS-505 and Kindle readers I have seen. Having said that, they all use the same manufacturer and screen and the screens vary widely from even one unit to another of the same brand and model. You never know what you'll get til you fire one up.2. The E-Pub format from Adobe rather than a proprietary format.3. Elegant, clean look (design)4. Lending option5. 6 font sizes, two fonts6. Clear, nice reading screen7. Normal page numbers vs. Kindle's ""Location"" nonsense8. Expandable via Micro SD9.

Coe ""skywalker""","[19, 27]","I bought two Nooks for my daughters with the false hope of enticing them into reading some classics as most of those are available free on line.  First, disappointment came from the terrible quality control.  One of the nooks stopped working and drawing interesting geometric lines on the screen next day.  B&N did not agree to accept returns as they have this 'policy against returns of Nooks if you did not buy extended coverage insurance.' B&N's customer service issued me an Return Authorization number and said they would review the item and if they find it defective they would send me a replacement.  No response for a month. When I called B&N customer service again, after 1 hour of being put on a round of various departments, the person in 'Digital Dept' explained that they had decided that the item was ""broken due to customer's mishandling"" and hence, no replacement was being sent. B&N's customer service did not even have the courtesy to tell me that or return the original item.  I am currently disputing the charge through my credit card, but B&N's irresponsibleness in handling this claim made me wonder if this company has any business mind at all.  BN is a bookseller and it should target its business model in the e-book trade to make money through selling downloads and not by making one-time profit from the electronic gadget.  B&N, or any other ebook seller, should practically give away these readers to make customers buy downloads, like how the shaver companies sell the shaving kit cheap and make up from the sale of blade cartridges.  Having had the displeasure of trying to figure out the non-intuitive way to use the Nook, only to learn it was broken next day, convinced me that B&N should stay being what it was - a paper bookseller in the street corner.  The final blow was to learn two weeks later, that B&N dropped the price of Nook for whopping $60.  Again I called the customer service, wondering if it would be worth my time.  Again, no satisfactory answer as they have this policy against return of Nooks.  I received an offer of $10.00 B&N gift certificate as a consolation, when I asked to speak the supervisor of Digital Dept., which I still have not received.  I also did not receive credit for the five downloads (none of them classics) my daughter purchased on the day we bought the Nook, that was in the returned-and-not-credited Nook.

Those were the Nook has a user-servicable battery and expandable memory. If your Kindle battery dies you have to send it back to Amazon to have it replaced. It also costs double the price of a Nook battery.

McMahon,"[3, 3]","I've seen some negative reviews from people who purchased the Nook earlier this year (Jan/Feb), however, I just bought mine about a week ago and have had 0 problems with it.  My wife received hers as a Christmas gift and has never had a problem with it.  I upgraded immediately to firmware 1.3 (the newest version) which adds some games (yay for Sudoku!) as well as a web browser.  If you are looking for a mobile web device, stick to a smart phone or netbook as this is not it.  That's not a complaint as I never expected this to be a web browser for me, it's first and foremost an e-book reader, and it's a great one at that!The e-ink screen is amazing, and makes reading so much easier than an LCD screen (if you have to read a lot of PDFs for work I would buy one of these just for that!).  The other features on this are outstanding as well.  It reads a number of formats including epub and PDF, so you are not stuck only shopping for books from one source (i.e. the Kindle, iPad, and Sony e-reader).  It is also compatible with Adobe Digital Editions, so it's a snap to download a book from my local library and read it on my Nook.  It's also easy to lend books to other Nook users (so long as the book you have is LendMe(TM) compatible).  The media player works well, but only plays MP3s, so none of the songs you bought off of iTunes that is an M4P (i.e. DRM'd beyond use) will work - that's why I always recommend buying digital music from Amazon's MP3 store - great selection and prices, and NO DRM.  The sound quality from the speakers on the Nook is not so good (they're small and I didn't expect them to be top quality), but if you plug in some headphones it sounds great!I also like that it comes with three free books already pre-loaded (Dracula, Little Women, and Pride & Prejudice) and you can customize your background/screen saver with BMP, JPG, etc. pictures.  The only downside is that the battery life is not quite up to par with some of the other e-book readers out there.  A lot of that is due to the LCD touchscreen, but it's worth the hit to the battery life.  That being said, I have had no complaints with the battery life for my day-to-day usage and if you are a heavy user, you can buy a back-up/secondary battery to swap out (try that with your iPad!).  As the title says, I love my Nook, and it seems like Barnes & Noble has gotten the bugs fixed.  You can also take your Nook into Barnes & Noble and they'll go over all of the features and show you how to get the most out of it - not to mention you can read any e-book they have for free while in the store, and they are currently in a 5 week promotion where they are giving away 1 e-book each week to anyone who brings their Nook into the store.",5.0,Love My Nook!,1274227200,"05 19, 2010",Electronics,1.0

My nook was fully updated with all the firm wear and it is TOTALLY bug free and the speed of page turning is pretty close to the kindles. .What I like about the nook:1)The battery and memory are easily accessible so you can easily replace either if you have an issue down the road.2)WiFi - Wifi is available everywhere in my area, so I love it. They also offer free 3G for purchasing books from B&N.;3)Internet access. I've been reading posts that say the nook doesn't have internet access, but it does. Maybe these folks haven't read their manuals yet. I logged on to ebay just the other day from a coffee shop.3)epub. There are a lot of 3rd parties that offer epub, so it opens up a lot of purchasing opportunities. Also, if you are of the ""pirate"" persuasion, you will find that most files are pdf or epub.4)The color screen. Some have called this useless eye candy, but it depends on what you use the nook for. If your just reading books on it, then screen is useless. I do a lot of shopping on ebay so I like being able to see the photos in color. I guess I could carry a pda for that purpose, but who wants to drag more junk around.What I hate:1)The virtual keyboard is hell. I have small hands and I find the keyboard very hard to use. I don't know how men are able to type anything on this keyboard. What's worst, there isn't a compatible stylus. I think this was a HUGE mistake for nook. I think Gen 2 will definitely need to fix this issue. Lets hope they come out with a compatible stylus for those of us who have a Gen 1.2)Battery life. Here's the thing with the battery. The small color screen on the bottom sucks up a LOT of the battery life. So if you are constantly adding notes and such, you'll only get 1 to 3 days of your battery. If you don't used the screen on the bottom very often, then you will get 7 to 10 days from your battery. If your not using the bottom screen, then the nook turns it off and you can continue to read your book without draining your battery. Some people say they can help but hit the bottom screen while reading, so if you have fumbling fingers you can just wait 1 minute for the bottom screen to go dead and your ""back in business.""",4.0,Kindle Review From Buyer Who Purchased AFTER Firmware Was Released,1274832000,"05 26, 2010",Electronics,1.0

You can organize by author and title, but that's about it. Sorting through sideloaded media, if you have a lot of it, can be a real pain. Also, there's no way to delete B&N; books. They have to be archived, which means they are still on the nook taking up space.A couple of firmware changes have fixed some of the issues with the nook, but there are some problems (such as the Etch-A-Sketch effect described above) that may never be resolved. I was, for the most part, aware of these issues before I made my purchase, so it was not that big of a deal to me as it might be for other potential buyers. Overall, the nook is a gorgeous e-reader (at least compared to the 1980s retro style of the Kindle), and it does its job quite effectively.I would heartily suggest the nook to anyone that needs a relatively well-priced e-reader that has access to a massive library of e-books and various formats.EDIT 7/14/10: After the latest software updates, my nook experience has drastically improved. Page turns are much faster, and though the Etch-A-Sketch effect is still there it's nowhere near as noticeable. B&N; has added general browsing to the wi-fi; it's a pain to navigate, but the option is now there for people who need to access the internet. Games have been added- Sudoku and Chess. Battery life seems to have improved for me, as I can now run the nook several hours a night for about a week before it needs to be recharged.

This is a personal opinion, and I can absolutely understand why others may want the keyboard.  I put in pagemarks etc on books, but don't type a lot of notes into the ebooks when reading.  If you do a lot of this, you may want to test run the onscreen keyboard and see if you like it.  I don't, the amount of typing is very limited, so onscreen is perfect and I'm used to it with my phones.Using this over wifi to surf the internet is something you can do, but it isn't the best.  You can in a pinch, but it's easier for me to pull out my smartphone and crank into a website.The number of places to get books, especially free ones, is awesome with the Nook handling so many formats.  B&N; just search 0.00 and titles and you'll get thousands of classics come up that copyright is over and they are free.  gutenberg.org is puts free classics by the tens of thousands out that you can download onto your Nook for free, google books does this and a few other sites.  Tons and Tons of books for free, I haven't read Tom Sawyer in 20+ years and am now, for free.  Just an addition to note.Lots of periodicals, newspapers etc, that you can get daily.I take my kids into B&N; and they love to look through the kids books.  While there, I can read any book over their Wifi for free for up to an hour.  I don't use this a lot, but once a month or so when I take the kids, it's pretty cool.Overall, I'm really pysched, this Nook has been awesome.",5.0,Awesome Reader,1297728000,"02 15, 2011",Electronics,1.0

I took it home, charged it for the 4 hours the store clerk suggested.  The problem came when I tried to register it so I can load up some ebooks.  I kept getting the error message that it can't connect, try again or call customer service.  After 5 attempts, I called customer service.  They were not surprised I couldn't register.  It seems that although the Nook is available for purchase in the stores, you can't register them due to serial number issues in their software.  Tech support doesn't feel this is information they need to pass onto the stores, so the stores have no idea.  So you have two choices, you can sit tight and wait for the problem to be rectified (btw - they have no idea when that will be), or you can return the item to the store and order a new from [...], becuase those units can be registered no problem.

Initially, I liked it, but I quickly learned that the battery life wasn't nearly the quoted time (it lasts about 2 days for me, 3 max with wireless off and the most power-saving settings). The e-ink/lcd screen mix was nice for navigation, although I understand that the newer touch models will be more battery-efficient. Despite this drawback, it was so much more convenient than paperbacks. As much as I love the feel of books, in a NYC apartment, there just isn't all that much room for them!That nook lived for about 9 months until a part of the screen died - just black pixels. I called customer service and after a long painful process, got it replaced. The unit I got was clearly a refurbished unit, which wouldn't have bothered me, had it been identical to the one I sent it. My original nook had a two-part screen, this new nook had a one-part screen and its' buttons squeaked when pressed. Little did I know at the time that this was the sign of a very important defect! As it happened, this 'squeaking', which made the buttons difficult to press, also caused the page-turn buttons to crack just one month past warranty. Needless to say, I wasn't delighted. Apparently, the page-turn buttons cracking is a very common defect. So if you buy a nook, remember this: if the button squeaks and is hard to press, it will break. Return it while you can. Not all the nooks are like this (my old one wasn't), so I recommend checking it out.Overall - 3/5 - it's a solid reading device but doesn't really compare to the new-generation nook simple touch/kindle touch devices or even the Kindle 3 keyboard (which I now also own).",3.0,Nice device but battery and Customer Service problems,1322352000,"11 27, 2011",Electronics,0.0

The battery life is misrepresented by B&N.; The only way you could possibly get 10 days out of the battery is if it is off. However, 2 to 4 days is a real possibility, So, bring your charger or USB to computer cable. Just like Apple IPOD, the B&N; folks decided to use a non-standard USB cable that appears to match the Apple ones. This is a minor problem, but do not expect to borrow a USB cable from someone while on travel. The included small charger worked very well.The key thing is how does the NOOK function as a book reader. In my opinion, it is adequate, and no more. I downloaded a number of free books without any problem. I also downloaded some paid books form B&N.; Once again, no problem. Finally, I downloaded some books from my public library onto my computer (not the NOOK)using the free Adobe software. Using the USB cable to my NOOK, I simply dragged the books to the NOOK, and voila, two seocnds later they were available for 14 days. So far so good. One could now rant about the interface (so-so), or the fact that you should reduce the color-screen brightness to about 10% to save the battery as well as turn off the WI-FI when not in use, and so forth, but how does it work when reading a book.If you are like me, and read fairly fast, most books will be a real page turners, since there is not much on a page compared to a real print on paper book. The print is clear. It is faily black on a slightly grey background (some might say off-white), which under a bright reading light is quite comfortable. For the eyesight challenged, there are bigger fonts accompanied with still more page turning. The same is true of the KINDLE. Page turning is easy and intuitive, so not a problem. Use the buttons on the side, not the color interface.A big feature of the NOOK is the ability to add a memory card. Well it is true you can do this, but it is not for the faint of heart or fingernail impaired. The first time you try to open the NOOK using the nearly invisible tab, you will wonder if you are going to break the cover. Just be careful, follow the instructions, and all will be well. Now, why would you want to add memory. As it arrives, the NOOK holds a huge number of books. You might want to add some of your work in PDF documents - this chews up space fast - and the pdf reading capability is primitive at best. Get a small netbook for this purpose and leave the NOOK for books. Changing the battery-RIGHT! Perhaps at the end of life, 2 to 3 years, to save a service trip. By then the technology will be antique, and you will replace the whole NOOK, not just the battery.A disappointment is the lack of even a primitive browser so that you could check email without lugging along another computer. The KINDLE has this feature. The NOOK can be ""upgraded"" to also have a browser, but then it is non-standard, and you might have trouble as B&N; upgrades the official firmware. Perhaps B&N; will relent and give us email capability similar to the APPLE I-Touch. I can understand not wanting to overload AT&T; with too much traffic, but simple text emails should not have been a problem.Finally, why would you want a NOOK in the first place. Remember, real books use no power, are truly random access, can be lent to anyone for as long as you like, and will function far into the future regardless of technology changes. The only purpose I can see for having a NOOK is for travel and for electronically borrowing books from a library without getting into your car or walking overmuch. Well, scratch the last, since you can borrow and read books on your computer. The airplane travel or train commute is a biggie. Books are heavy and bulky. Carrying 6 books onto an airplane is a pain. Plus, hauling out your NOOK to read makes you look technically COOL, and for the short term, is sure to start a conversation with a nearby stranger. The conversation might be interesting and better than the NOOK-book you were going to read.Well, I've written enough and am going to read a book that I just downloaded from the local library. I'll try not spill my soup on the NOOK while reading and eating -or it would become a SOUPER-NOOK.",3.0,A HALF COOKED NOOK,1263686400,"01 17, 2010",Electronics,0.0

I had been thinking about purchasing an e-reader for a while, but I have never liked reading for long periods of time on a computer screen--never realizing that devices like the Nook (and the Kindle) use a different type of screen that is totally different then a back lit computer screen.Being able to go into a B & N store and actually handle the Nook was what finally sold me--too bad I didn't wait until the price dropped!!  Plus, the store personnel were very helpful and they even have a class on Wednesday nights for new Nook owners or those curious about it.One thing that pushed me to the Nook over the Kindle is the ability to read library books digitally checked out from my local public library.  This does require downloading a (free) piece of software called Adobe Digital Editions onto your computer, but there was a very clear set of instructions on the B&N; message boards relating to the Nook--a good place to check out if you are considering buying one.One comment I will make is that if you like to read books with pictures or diagrams in them the Nook (and probably the Kindle too) is not the best thing for you.  The Nook will display pictures, but not in the clearest or easiest way.  Its best for reading straight text like novels.I quickly determined that a cover was a good idea and ordered one--at that time my local store did not have any in stock (now they do).  Its probably a good idea for most people, but there are a variety of covers and cases available (in store, online and from other places such as Best Buy--so shop around and look at some).If you like a certain author, genre, etc, I highly suggest exploring whats available as that could very well influence your decision.  I am a very eclectic reader and have been happy with whats available so far.  B&N; does tout the fact that free books from Google book are available for the Nook.  I have downloaded a few of those.  Most of these are older and the scanning quality is not always the best, I do like historical books, so this is of some interest to me, but it might not be for you.I do travel from time to time and had no trouble at all going through security at the airport with my Nook and its great for traveling to have a variety of books i one handy gadget.The Nook also allows you to read a book for free for up to an hour if you are in a B&N; store and I have done that several times and I do like that feature.  You can also download a free sample of most books, but its often only a few pages.I highly recommend the Nook, I am happy with mine, but do suggest you check out the message boards on b&N;'s website and see if a store in your area offers a class where you can check out the nook in detail.",5.0,Awesome reader!,1278806400,"07 11, 2010",Electronics,1.0

After having the Nook now for a month, I would have to say I absolutely love it! In one month, I have read seven books on my Nook eReader- all downloaded from my local library's online electronic database.  Today I just got the software update version 1.3 downloaded onto my Nook.  Version 1.3 is very different with the new menu options in the LCD touchscreen.  Some of the new software upgrades seem unnecessary for the use of the ereader, however as an educated consumer in the ereader industry, I understand B&N's logic for their recent upgrade capabilities with the competition of the Apple Ipad.  The Nook now offers a one click access to wifi, audio player, beta web application, games and  the ability to read ebooks for free in the store.  The latest upgrade also enabled a faster page turn, which was a common consumer complaint of the late version 1.2 software.  I had become quite accustomed to the previous page turn speed and now find myself flipping back to the previous page because I have hit the button too fast and missed the last few words in the sentence.  I did play with the game application and really enjoyed the chess game.  I found it fast to play and would serve as a good pass time in the future.  I didn't really see the point for an ereader to have this feature, however it will be something nice to have whether I choose to use it or not. One of the cons of the eReader that I have experienced is that B&N.com advertises emagazines for the device, however not all emagazines are compatible with the Nook and the subscription I purchased can only be viewed via the Zinia PC software program. I did not find this out until my impatience got the better of me and I had to call customer service. Overall, the ease of use of the Nook is incredible. I am very satisfied with my purchase and would recommend the ereader device to all my friends and family.  I think the consumer should really make sure when making a decision on purchasing an ereader to do their research. Make sure the ereader is a good fit for what you intend to use it for.

The one and only reason I chose Nook (instead of just sticking with and upgrading my beloved old Kindle 1) is its ability to download books from the public library. Tomorrow I am taking the Nook back to Best Buy for a refund, not an exchange. The Nook is attractive and nicely packaged. I completely expected it to just work, like my Kindle did (and still does) and all of my Apple products do. But, like so many other reviewers here, my Nook never even got up and running before it croaked. First, it would not complete the registration process. I have an active account on B&N; and strong WiFi in my home, plus this Nook also has 3G so there were not any connection problems. Then, when I decided to just register later and moved on to explore how the Nook worked, it froze. Could not reboot or turn it off by holding down power key as suggested in the troubleshooting help/support on the B&N; website. It did not work. I do not want to mess with taking the back off, using little screwdrivers or whatever to take out (the fully charged) battery, etc. We should not have to do that on a brand new 200.00 product! So, am taking it back and won't buy another until they improve the quality of the thing. I never had one bit of trouble with my trusty Kindle, and would not even be looking at another brand of reader except for Kindle's inability to download library books.  I'm giving the Nook two stars instead of one because, if it actually worked, it looks like it would be a nice ereader and it has a more open format than Kindle does.Update: 1/28/11Went to return the Nook for a refund today and at the last minute decided to give it another go, so did exchange instead. Tonight charged and powered up the replacement Nook, so far so good. It works perfectly. Registration was smooth and fast, wifi connected easily with my signal, downloaded a book quickly, and navigation is a breeze.  No problems encountered yet except that it is not downloading an available firmware update, and there's probably some explanation for that so not a big deal.  So, I might just end up keeping this baby as a companion to my Kindle. Love having the Nook with its open format for library and other downloads. Will see how it holds up over the next several weeks and then update my rating accordingly.Update: 2/3/11Returned the Nook to Best Buy today and bought a Kindle 3 through Amazon. After exchanging the first defective Nook then using its replacement for several days I found that the device worked pretty much as it was supposed to. There are a couple of minor things about it that I was not crazy about and probably would have gotten used to, but there is one problem (design flaw?) that for me is definitely a deal killer. One of the minor annoyances is that there is a lot of screen flash during any menu change. Another is that the color, lighted touch screen control at the bottom of the device is distracting when it lights up at any touch during reading. And after a while I was not that crazy about the menu navigation either, seemed like too many steps and screen flashes, but probably could have gotten used to that too. I would not have rejected the Nook just over those little quirks. The big reason that the Nook was no way going to work out for me is, again, that touch screen display at the bottom of the device. It is, like an iPad, highly reflective. So what that means is that when the screen is off, which it is most all of the time during reading, you can watch yourself read! The black screen reflects anything in front of it, almost like a dark mirror. That was a no go for me, no I did not like it at all. Aside from these annoyances, the Nook did well at everything it was designed to do. So will upgrade the rating to reflect (haha) that. I have to say that I am much happier with the Kindle, but Amazon really needs to get with the program and let Kindle use the epub format. They will eventually lose me and a lot of other prospective customers over the epub problem, it is that big of a deal.Yet another update! 5/31/11Caved in and purchased another Nook last week. I still love my Kindle and prefer it over Nook, but just could not wait another minute for Amazon to open Kindle to ePub for downloading public library books. So, last week when B&N; had Nooks for sale cheap on their eBay website (99.00, free ship, 3g/wifi, non-color, refurb w/ full warranty) I jumped on it. This refurb Nook worked much better out of the box than my initial brand new device purchased then returned back in Jan/Feb. I am using the Nook just for library books, and it does what it's supposed to do. Navigation works well, but seems like it requires more step than Kindle. Still do not like the reflective color screen below the reading area. There is one thing that I do like better on Nook, the screen background is a paler gray than Kindle making for easier reading in low light. I will keep this Nook until Amazon does ePub, then stick with Kindle.",3.0,Kindle lover jumps ship for a few hours,1296086400,"01 27, 2011",Electronics,0.0

Salinger, MSN, FNP, RN AHN-BC","[16, 17]","There are a multitude of reviews that compare and contrast the Nook and Kindle, so I'm not going to go into a full-blown comparison and review. I'm going to focus on my experience owning both, most specifically battery life and availability of books.My husband uses the kindle and I use the Nook. The reason I went with the Nook is because initially I was very ""anti"" non-paper book. He wanted a kindle and I sneered at the idea. I was being a book snob and didn't like the idea of books in electronic format, so I snubbed my nose at it.However, after we took a vacation and he had his kindle loaded with books, and I had 8-10 big paper books, I began to reconsider my position.  Upon return from our vacation I elected to get a Nook. I did so because I liked the idea of the touch screen at the bottom rather than the keyboard, which I thought made the kindle look klunky. I thought overall that the Nook was more aesthetically pleasing. So - I ordered the nook.There are two major things that the kindle has on the Nook, and that is far superior battery life, and significantly more books available for download - especially so if you read non-fiction.The battery life on my Nook is awful. So much so that I ordered a new battery thinking perhaps I had a dud. Nope - it's performance is just the same. If I am actively reading a book I have to recharge  every 3 days. If I don't read it for 10-14 days it will drain on it's own. Comparing this to my husband's kindle, he can go an entire 2 week trip reading books daily without having to recharge his kindle! It takes a couple months to drain with no usage. The kindle's battery life is mega-much more than my Nook. I have serious battery life envy. For that alone I've begun to covet his kindle.The second bummer is that most of the available books for Nook are fiction. There are some of the more popular non-fiction type books available. Usually whatever is most trendy at the time, but for the most part any professional type texts, or anything not on a best seller list that is non-fiction can't be found for the Nook platform. However, when I go to Amazon, 8 of 10 times, I'll find it available for download on the kindle.BUT! One thing about this is that for me, I tend to mark up and highlight my non-fiction books a lot because I'm using them for reference sources. It is very difficult to quickly retrieve highlighted text from the electronic source compared to my real, paper books. So I've actually come to realize that I'd likely be purchasing my non-fiction as real paper books anyways, so that I can have them for ready reference and mark them up with my highlights and little flags (yes - I'm a geek who uses the little flag tabs to mark pages in my books!) So, I'm now fine with the fact that I can't readily download non-fiction to my Nook and instead I continue to buy them as regular, paper books. As I said above, I'd likely buy my non-fiction as real books anyways since I use them as references.I now download all my fiction books to the Nook.

I was hesitate at first due to ever changing technology so I hesitated for a few years and finally after realizing I was spending more on books and gas to go the library (not to mention the boxes of books that were going to the Salvation Army every 3 months) that it would be cheaper just to buy an ereader and put an end to the madness.  After researching all ereaders and prices I finally settled on a kindle or so I thought.  After borrowing a friends for the weekend, I was a little disappointed that I could not download books from multiple sites.  I then borrowed a nook for a day, it was love.... I have had mine now for several weeks and can not put it down.  It is easy to download books from several sites including the public library!

Reads PDF (both scanned and standard text) and EPUB book formats with no hassles or conversion required. In-store help and extra features from B&N.; Page turning speed is much improved with most recent update. Android OS allows for almost unlimited software improvements and added features. Replacement batteries can be bought and installed easily. Accepts SD cards for increased storage capacity (this really comes in handy if you want to use the device as an mp3 player or for audiobooks).Cons: eInk display requires you to operate at a bit slower pace than the touchscreen alone would allow. (Also: Not sure why the price from this supplier is abnormally high?)I've played with an iPad and it's a very fun device. But what I don't like is a glowing backlit screen, as I look at a monitor all day. When I read, I want to relax and give my eyes a break, and that's why I prefer eInk displays.The Nook's primary advantage over the Kindle is that it allows you to read EPUB and PDF books (scanned or text; either works) and buy books from various online ebook stores, including the Sony Reader store. This has already allowed me to read two titles that I wouldn't have been able to get for the Kindle. It also works very easily with Adobe Digital Editions software, a huge plus. Currently Amazon offers some titles that B&N; does not (a very temporary state of affairs, I suspect), but those are usually available from Sony.Add the book loan feature, free library books, and the ability to take it to a B&N; store for bonus features, and this unit pretty much stomps the Kindle and Sony readers.The Nook is a little slower than a phone or your other electronic devices due to the e-Ink screen, but once you get used to it, the device seems very smooth. In fact, I find that having to slow down a little actually helps me relax, and once you master turning pages with a quick brush of the thumb across the touchscreen, reading with the Nook is a very pleasant experience.

I read tons of reviews etc and looked at both Kindle and Nook. Nook won out, mainly for the epub files. I truly think it is a superior product. After dealing with MP4 fiasco from iTunes, I will never use a proprietary format for files again. Epub is likely to be the most commonly used file format very very soon.Anyways, I finally got to open it yesterday morning. Set up was very easy and I downloaded a book in just a few minutes. I read all day while watching football yesterday. I LOVE LOVE LOVE my Nook. I love the ease of use and I really like the touch pad menu bar at the bottom. The reading screen, which is black and white (really grey) ""e-ink"" is amazingly clear and easy on the eyes. There are several different sizes of ""print"" to choose from, which is great for those of us over 40 (lol).  No reading glasses necessary.  The page turning speed is just fine. It refreshes the screen quickly. When you turn it off or to sleep it remembers where you left off and automatically starts there next time it's turned on.  If you do go ""off"" your book to browse other areas, you can easily get to your book right where you left off by pressing the ""reading now"" icon. Best of all, it is much much more comfortable to hold than a real book. For a gift I didn't ask for and didn't even think I'd ever like, it's awesome! I really thought ""who would want to read on a computer screen?"" But that was before I ever actually saw one.

My nook cost $150 from BB and the nook wifi-3g costs $200. Why pay more at an unauthorized dealer?Beware, many of the reviews here are out of date. Amazon has come out with the Kindle 3 and there has been another software update on the nook (1.5) so many of the issues here have long been resolved. I have had my nook for one month and read 4 books and listened to one book. So far no problems at all.The Kindle 3 has the latest e-ink screen technology (pearl) but then the nook's 1.5 software update increased contrast between letter and screen.  When I put a book next to my nook, the nook's screen is whiter and the contrast between text and page greater so the nook's screen is good enough for me. Very easy on the eyes to read but you need the proper reading light.Not that it matters. My decision to choose the nook was based on its ability to read library books something the Kindle cannot do. The experience of going online to my public library is akin to going online to a bookstore. A few minutes download time and it's on the nook (first your computer then you sideload it from there to your nook). They return themselves to the library afterward too.

It didn't, it only made it worse. Before the latest upgrade you could hold the power button down to unfreeze the screen. Now, with the latest upgrade, you have to disassemble the nook, take the battery out, plug it in to a wall charger, reseat the battery, wait, wait, wait, then it might unfreeze. Maybe the new ones will come with a small screwdriver holder so you always have some tools for fixing the screen. It defeats the purpose of a portable ereader if you have to take it apart all the time and have access to a charger and wall socket just to get the screen unfrozen. Barnes and Noble has known of these problems since the very first nook but has been unable, or unwilling, to fix the problems. The user interface needs a complete overhaul. The battery life is horrible. The screens have been developing cracks where the page buttons are. No file system, so all your books get lumped together.I suggest you look elsewhere for an ereader.

Its pdf support is much better than Kindle, supporting reflow. that way, you see the page as the native format with real page numbers. it is quite readable if your file is basically text. I don't know if Kindle has improved in this regard but when I bought and returned Kindle DX six months ago, this feature wasn't there and pdf looked more like an image than text. Even DX's large size did not help me read pdf books because it was small and dimmer than regular text. Now on Nook I can read them as though they are in native format. no conversion is needed. but again these are mainly text-heavy pdf files, not complex, graphic-heavy ones.second area where Nook is better is the screen clarity, the contrast between the background and the font is much better than my experience of Kindle DX.Third, user replaceable battery and additional memory slot is a plus for me as I intend to use the device overseas at some point. In case of a problem with the battery, international users have to send your Kindles to the United States for battery replacement? Nook replacement battery costs $30.Fourth, a better looking device. I don't need the keyboard but it takes a significant space on Kindle 2. the LCD screen works fine but it reflects light and consumes battery when reading so this might not be necessarily a plus. perhaps a physical keyboard that can be separated from the device might do a better job.Fift, support for more file formats, particularly epub.Note: Nook is speedier than many reviewers here suggest. I suspect it is due to the new software update. I was able to swipe through pages with no difficulty.Kindle advantages:1. slightly cheaper with no tax and easy to return; amazon.com's wonderful return policy. (so far I have bought hundreds of products on amazon, and returned only a few of them but the reason why I bought them here is because of the return policy. amazon.com is simply the best online retailer in the US with the best customer service). BN will impose restocking fees if you have opened it. But BN offers some deals when you visit one of their stores if you live near-by.2. availability of international 3G support where you can buy books. Nook needs to catch up on this.3. better, usable dictionary. Nook dictionary is hidden behind a few clicks on the LCD which makes it really unpractical.4. its experimental browser which allows you to open other websites. I don't need a browser in a reader but in case of need it is a good feature.5. better ebook library. but BN is fast catching up and the ebook that I bought yesterday was cheaper at BN by four dollars. maybe that's an exception but deserves mention. but epub/pdf availability on Nook makes it superior in my opinion. also, new devices such as Irex and Que readers will use BN's collection so more machines will be available, which will improve BN's economies of scale.To sum up, for me the deal-breaker was pdf reflow without conversion into native format, user changeable battery and additional memory slot. These features are available on Nook but not on Kindle. Nook should improve on user interface to rely less on LCD during reading (such as dictionary), make LCD less reflective, international 3G access and ability to buy books. It is a four-star device.Finally, kudos to Amazon to allow comments on competitor products. I did not see place on BN.com to comment on Nook. this means a much more interactive shopping experience on Amazon.",4.0,better than Kindle 2 in some important aspects,1266624000,"02 20, 2010",Electronics,1.0

The screen will become a responsive QWERTY keyboard.  While you're actually reading a book, the screen becomes your means of navigation through the book, your on-hand dictionary, your way of changing the font type/size, etc.  It's a brilliant design.-The recently released 1.3.0 firmware really speeds up the device in all regards.  It also added chess and sudoku, though anyone buying a device for playing games probably should look elsewhere.  Also a web browser, but again, nothing to write home about.  This thing is meant to read, and read it does.-Truly beautiful e-ink screen which is just the perfect size for reading (about the size of a trade paperback).  It astounds everyone who sees it for the first time.-User-replace battery and expandable memory by microSD card.  This was the real deal-breaker for me, as I am bothered by companies who force you to send the product to them and give them $100 for something you can do yourself in 5 minutes for $20 when the Li-Ion battery inevitably loses its charge.  It seems completely illogical and the nook addresses this problem.All other aspects are at least equal with the competition (the Kindle) and aren't necessarily worth mentioning.  Overall I would recommend this to absolutely anyone looking for an e-reader, as it is the same exact price as the Kindle but offers so much more.

When Kindle 2 came out, I decided it was finally time to purchase one, and decided to use Amazon's customer reviews to guide me.  Several things stood out to me that I believed would be a problem for me in the future that I could not overlook:  the proprietary nature of the Kindle e-book format and inability to read other formats, the absence of an expansion slot for an SD card, and the organizational issues that people were having with their books on the device when not using the online services.  After searching for a bit, I discovered that almost all the complaints from Kindle 2 users were addressed by Barnes & Noble in the Nook, including the (limited) ability to loan books (which wasn't really an issue for me, but I could see as a plus in the future.)The device is beautiful, and it feels good in my hands.  It is a joy to read on it, and I find the size is perfect for me.  After I was able to get it out of its substantial and extremely protective packing,I plugged it in to charge per the instructions and proceeded to try it out.  When I pulled up a book that I had been reading using their e-reader software while waiting for my Nook to arrive, it froze on the loading screen and could not be rebooted using any method in their manual.  Upon searching the forums, I discovered that if your device and B&N;'s library are out of sync, the software gets ""confused"" about what page to open to and will freeze.  The solution was to completely remove the battery and plug the machine in without it before re-inserting the battery.  That was rather annoying, but the version update seemed to fix that problem for me.I gave the device 4 stars out of 5 because it has the potential to be perfect, but has a few issues that leave it short of the mark. The first is that the battery management leaves a LOT to be desired.  It simply doesn't perform as advertised.  It sucks battery power like mad (for an e-reader) even with all their power-saving strategies in place.  If you are in a position to charge your Nook every night or ever other night, then this wouldn't be an issue for you.  The second is that the response of the machine is laggy.  I understand that it is improved from where it started, but even so, it is slow to load, and slow to respond to taps and key presses.  Even so, it's still not slower than turning a page in an actual book.  It makes entering anything in via keyboard excruciating.The 3G is amazing.  I love the ability to ""interface with the mother-ship"" as someone on the forums so aptly termed it.  I love the ability to ""hot-spot"" my home network to increase my interface speed.  I love to buy a book from my wish-list on a whim and at the push of a button.  I love the ability to scroll through the book covers to find the novel I want without having to tab through every book I own.  I don't love how much the touchpad sucks the battery.  It's a very cool tool that must be used sparingly, and as such, almost completely takes the advantage of having it away.  I don't like that the entire back has to pop off to get to the battery or the SD card.  I had envisioned buying a batch of cards and using them as a kind of ""bookshelf"".  However, the inability to easily access it takes the convenience of that away as well.  The expansion and extra storage is there, but will only be of efficient use if you want to expand beyond 1,500 books to 1,501 and so on.I had rather hoped that I could replace my book-buying habit with e-books, but have since discovered that not all the books I want are in e-book format, Kindle or otherwise.  No Harry Potter books? That one hurts.  Ender's Game Series? Negative.  Stephen Lawhead? Many of those I can't replace with digital copies.  Oh so much older science fiction that I'd love to have at my fingertips...we're just not there yet.Bottom line, though: if the battery were to last the full 10 days using it under standard reading conditions, if I could easily organize my books into a logical order that I like and not have to use the virtual keyboard to search, and if the response of the system were quick enough to make the virtual keyboard easier to use, it would be everything that I want it to be.  The rest is up to the authors and their publishers.**EDIT 08-23-11**Well, I had to send the first unit back after 7 months of use because one of the arrow buttons cracked in the middle, and I almost exclusively use the window-swipe portion for page turning, which is a feature I really adore.  No problem, they shipped me a new (refurbished, as per the rules) one without no trouble at all.  In fact, they had a new one to me within a few days, at which point all I had to do was package it in the same box and return it.  Great customer service.HOWEVER...over the months since, I have experienced the e-ink display ""greying-out"" a bit at a time.  The text become lighter and more difficult to read.  It would become dark again when I flipped the page, but still disconcerting.  Fast-forward to a week ago.  There was a hardware update for the machine, and once complete, I now have screen artifacts that will not go away.  It started as one horizontal and one vertical line.  I reset it to factory defaults, but it was too late.  More appeared, along with darkening of the screen to the point that I can no longer see anything and have to reset it.  The screen is ruined.  I don't know what happened, but since then it has gotten even worse.  It is no longer possible for me to read on it, it's out of warranty, and I cannot afford to replace it with a 3g version.  So...although I loved it, I no longer trust Nook.  I will miss it, but I think it's time to finally go with Kindle.  Now how the heck am I ever going to replace all those books I bought that I can no longer READ?? I realize that isn't exclusively a Barnes and Noble issue, but I paid for a book that I can no longer LEGALLY read on another device.

I was really set on the Kindle but after reading some more about the Barnes & Noble Nook it really clicked with me.  I liked the idea of a user-accessible battery, and the formats that are compatible with this e-reader.  The B&N; ebook library had a much larger selection at the time and of books i was really wanting that I couldn't find on amazon.  At first the touch screen seemed ridiculous and somewhat pointless, this caused me to really lean towards the Kindles as I figured it would really drain the battery and was more of a gimmick than a necessary part of the device. BUT after using the Nook it just makes navigation quick and awesome, totally won me over and I hope on the next gen they don't decide to do away with the touch screen.  You can set it to shut off when not in use for a few seconds and the battery lasts quite a long time.  When the touch screen is off it still works to turn pages.  You just swipe your finger across the dark screen, pages turn, it's quite nice.E-readers in general didn't click with me, didn't think I'd really use it as anything more than a ""toy of the week,"" but after the first 2 weeks my Nook has become probably my favorite device that I've gotten, over my ipod even, i just love it (and it's so sleek too).  Navigating the bookstore is incredibly simple and I LOVE being able to read reviews online with it for books and making wishlists.  Finding selections of free ebooks is a snap.  The e-ink screen is amazing, if you haven't tried reading on one do it.  It is definitely superior to trying to read on an lcd screen.  Being able to change text size is also a huge plus (pretty standard on all ereaders, just stating my love for the option).  I haven't had a single software/hardware problem at all so that is great.  The only thing i hope they update on the software is making it possible to organize books into customized categories/folders (unless you can and I just don't know how).Supposedly you can link up to 5 Nooks to one account so they can all share the same library of ebooks you've purchased so now I'm trying to get my family members to buy Nooks as well!

They are quick to criticize, and slow to praise. I've read all the criticisms on here thus far and while some have a point, most are absolutely ridiculous or downright untruthful. One guy said he bought four Nooks for Christmas and three out of the four were either rendered inoperable or ceased to function altogether. Sounds like an Amazon-paid poster to me...fishy story.Please know that I'm not partial to B&N.; It's a bookstore. I have no loyalty to them as they have never put out an electronic product before. At the same time, I also own some Sony products and they continue to work either fine or great. I don't hate Amazon, nor the Kindle. In fact, I use Amazon for purchases frequently and I would have bought the Kindle if I was partial to it. Same goes for Sony. However, I did my own comparitive research on e-readers and concluded with the Nook being the best fit for me, my needs, and my expectations. All so far, have been met. Whatever the case with negative ""geek"" reviews, here's my take on the Nook:- It's out-of-the-box easy and very intuitive. Mine came on Saturday, and by that evening I had: 1)set up my B&N; account, 2)fully charged my unit, 3)connected to my in-home wireless network, 4)set to my personal preferences (complete with personalized wallpaper & screensavers), 5)downloaded some easy-listening music, 6)dragged over a PDF file from work, 7)and downloaded three books (2 purchased, 1 free) from the B&N; link to enjoy. All this done before dinner...- The Eink display rules. I actually find it easier to read than an actual book, especially considering the fact that I am holding a digital unit near half the actual size of a tried-and-true book. It's light, sleek, slim, portable and cool.- While the touch screen is one way to go, it is not really necessary. And you really need to adjust the brightness on it pretty much from the get-go. It's like staring into headlights while trying to read. But once I did adjust the brightness as well as the touch screen timer (10 sec, 30 sec or 60 sec), it was actually a nice to have function.- After initially fully charging the unit, my Nook has lasted going-on 4 days now. Those who complain it doesn't last 10-12 days, while they are justified at being angry with B&N; for ""false"" advertising, I still see no problem. I never read their claim for this sort of durability, thus, I'm not upset with having to charge my unit every 2-3 days. I see it the same as I see my cell phone or Ipod. And hopefully in the near future Powermat will come out with a Nook adapter...- SD Card option. Not necessary. But nice option to have. Already bought one. Already installed one. Easy cheesy...16GB...BAM!!!- Wi-Fi connectivity capability. I have a standard wireless router in my house. I was up & running in minutes. My first wi-fi purchase was Treasure Island for $.99 and then got a free copy of the Oxford Holy Bible. The B&N; library is second-to-none when it comes to finding what you are looking for on e-book.- Bookmarks...I don't see the problem??? I haven't even upgraded my firmware yet, but every time I open up a book in My Library on my Nook, it goes directly to the page I last read. And this is done whether I leave a bookmark or not. It just does it...so what's everyone complaining about? I have 10 items in My Library so far and it does this for each item, except my PDF files from work.- Browser capability, or lack thereof...biggest dissappointment for me. If they could create a Netbook/E-Reader that was the size of an e-reader, but possessed the ""little PC"" functionality of a netbook, I would be in heaven. Until they do, I have both. Depending on the Kindle's capability, perhaps this is a strong seller for others out there. But for me, the Nook's other features outweighed not having a web browser capability.Bottom Line: For me, I love it. Best little toy I've purchased in years.

I decided on the Nook because when I compared it to other e-readers, I found features that appealed to me. I'm in Barnes & Noble all the time, so I'm very much into the feature about getting deals on books/special content while in the store. I'm also into the idea of having both wi-fi and 3g coverage because it's like having plan A and B in one shot, so you won't go without a signal. I like the touch screen at the bottom portion of the Nook. When I first got the Nook, I was welcomed into the idea of an e-reader with the ""tour"" and some notes in ""the daily"" section of the Nook. I enjoyed reading about how to use it. The e-ink display is great, and the page turns are faster than regularly turning a page in real life. I don't care if any other reader does it faster or whatever. I think half a second page turn is good enough! I liked the amount of books available, as well as the idea of having an ebook wishlist. I think the best thing I like about the Nook is that it has a replaceable battery. I don't think the Kindle has that, so I'd rather not be screwed when the battery eventually gives out. I understand that there were some issues in past software versions of the Nook, but I think that it deserves some patience rather than completely ruling it out. I think if I had any sort of cons, I think the ""word lookup"" is a little lagging when it comes to selecting the correct word. Also, the touch text screen is a little small, so it's easy to type errors. I noticed the side surfaces of the Nook will attract fingerprints, but that's not terrible. I don't think those things are enough to make me like it any less. I'm not here to bash Kindle or any other e-reader because I think it all depends on how you want to be able to use your e-reader. It all depends on preference. Save yourself the time and don't bother bashing my review because I most likely won't have the time to answer. I'll be too busy enjoying books on my Nook =).(Actually, I find it a bit ironic that the Nook is rated low on Amazon...not surprised ;) )I'm just being honest with what I like is all.",4.0,"My first e-reader, really cool stuff =)",1263340800,"01 13, 2010",Electronics,1.0

Yes, the Nook had a rough beginning with buggy sofware due to a rush to market release.  That is the case for many electronic devices and software titles for that matter.  To start with, I can say that just about all complaints about the Nook have been addressed in the latest release.  There are a few additional features that I would like but even those will added on future releases.  For those of you considering purchasing a new ebook reader, I hope to share information that I have found to help in you decision.  There are 3 major ebook readers on the market with several more on the way.  The Kindle, Nook, and Sony ereaders.  I really don't think any one particular ereader is better than the other as the all have their strengths and weaknesses.  After much thought, I chose the Nook.  First off, I would like to say that there is plenty of debate going on about ebook readers vs the new IPad.  IMO, not worth comparing.  I looked at the IPad and don't see me reading too much on it because of the lcd screen.  I work on computers all day and that's the last thing my poor ole tired eyes want to see when I get home.  I also wanted a dedicated reading device because I know that I would be playing with all of the apps on the IPad and would get no reading done.  The e-ink technology is great despite what some technogeeks say.  It's only going to get better but for now it's what made be want to get an ebook in the first place.  The battery life between a device with e-ink and the Ipad isn't even close.  10 hours for the Ipad vs 7-10 days.  Anyway,  The Ipad is nice if you travel and need everything in one device.  I'm not here to cut down the Ipad as it has it's place but it just isn't as good of a device for reading ebooks as the new e-ink technology simple because e-ink looks better, it's easier on the eyes, and the battery lasts much much longer.I have researched the 3 major brands of ebook readers on the market today and here's what I found:Kindle: Somewhat proprietary in that it can't read epub books which is somewhat of an ebook standared.  Not so much of a problem since many of the epub books available for free are also available in the kindle format for free anyway.  The battery life is exceptional on the Kindle.  The Kindle has been out longer and I find that many sites produce the public domain books in the Kindle format so not having the ability to read epub books is less of an issue.Nook: The Nook can read Barnes & Noble books as well as Epub books.  I personally find the ability to read epub books the greatest advantage of the Nook.  After all, it's all about the number of books available more than the features of the reader.  I have found and loaded many epub books on my Nook.  There are plenty of web sites that offer these free public domain books.  Yes, the Kindle does have a lot of free content but it does not have all of the epub books.  I also very much like the 3G connectivity on the Nook.  I have found myself many times in places without wifi access just scrolling through the book titles on the Barnes and Noble site looking for my next download.  You can also view the free ebooks on their site and read an overview of each book.  I also like that the Nook will automatically attempt to connect to a wifi hotspot first and then the 3G connection if it can't connect via wifi.  The Nook is also built on the Android operating system so many of the applications built for that operating system will eventually become available to the Nook.  The Nook has a user replaceable battery which at this time is around $30 (Not bad at all!!).  The internal memory is about the same on the Nook as other devices but you can also install an additional Micro SD card.  I have done this and it is another major advantage to me personally.  I load all my personal epub books on the additional SD card and the books I download from the Barnes and Noble site go to the device's internal memory.  The books from Barnes and Noble are stored on their server and will always be available to re-download should something happen to the Nook.  The ebooks on the additional sd card are backed up on my computer.  I feel that I am covered should something happen to my Nook.  I also load mp3 audio books, mp3 songs and photos to the additional SD card because they are memory hogs and I want to leave the built in memory available for downloads.  I do have 3 bad things to say about the Nook.  First, the touch screen on the bottom could have been better.  I like the funcionality of it but the touch sensitivity is off.  It works great for traversing the menus and such but for page turning it really needs work.  It does work and you can get better at it with the right touch but nothing close to the ipad touch screen.  It's not a show stopper by any means.  It works better if you flick in the lower left corner of the screen for some reason but if you can't get it, just use the page turn buttons.  Second, the battery life isn't as good as the Kindles.  You can greatly improve it if you turn off the wifi/3G access but it would still be several days shorter.  To me it's worth it.  The wifi/3G access is easy to disable.  Just use the Airplane mode and turn it on which disables everything and back on when you want to search for books.  The color lcd screen shuts itself off automatically within a few seconds when it detects no activity.  This works very well.  The battery life again is not a showstopper.  It's not as good as the Kindles but it's good enough.  Lastly, the Nook has wifi access capability and a web browser.  This needs much improvement.  The wifi is good for downloading books especially if you're in a bad 3G coverage area.  The web browsing is in a beta mode right now and I'm hoping that this improves.  It is both awkward and slow which makes it's use very limited.  Yes, it does work in a pinch but boy how combersome it is to use.Sony E-readers:  Sony is in a bit of a different light than the Kindle or Nook.  They have several different models with different features so it would be too much to review them all.  I have read that all models except their Pocket Edition have tremedous glare due to the touch screen.  I guess that would have to be a personal decision as to whether or not that bothered you.  From what I noticed, there is much more glare so you will be switching the angle of the reader to find the right spot.  The touch screen is a nice feature though so it's worth considering for those who intend to write a lot of notes highlighting.  I like the pocket edition.  It doesn't even come close to the features of the Kindle or Nook but it is worth considering.  It doesn't have any wifi or 3G connectivity so all of your books will have to be downloaded via your PC and then loaded to your sony ebook reader.  For some this won't be a big deal but for others it will.  If this isn't a show stopper for you then the price of the ebook makes it a nice contender.  The price recently dropped $50 and even lower at some places making this a real bargain in that it can be purchased for nearly $120.00 or more cheaper than it's competitors.  This would be great for those who are budget conscience and who isn't these days.  The outer casing is made of aluminum and is very strong.  It doesn't have the glare issue found on it's bigger brothers.  It can read epub books so that's a plus.  The battery is not user replaceable but for this price I suspect you'll get years of use out of it and newer better devices will be on the market by the time it dies.Well, I own the Nook and I will update this as I find anything new whether good, bad, or otherwise....",5.0,Review of 3 major ebook readers with a slant towards the Nook,1274313600,"05 20, 2010",Electronics,1.0

I bought the WiFi version.First, the good points: One, the interface is very easy and I can quickly load my own documents from my computer into my Nook.  The main reason that I purchased the Nook is to read articles from the internet-I download and transfer into my Nook an average of about 5 articles per day.  I simply do a virtual print of the articles into PDF format and then transfer them to Nook.  The readability in Nook is satisfactory.  The option to increase or decrease text size in Nook (which I know is not anything unique to Nook) is very helpful also.Two, downloading books from the Barnes & Noble store is very easy.  The choice of titles is large enough for me and I find it easy to navigate through a book (with one or two exceptions, see below) using the Nook options.  I do find however that the prices for some popular books at B&N; is a little bit high.  For example, most recent books sell for $9.99, but occasionally, I'll find one that I want but it sells for anywhere from $12.99 to $15.99.Three, I like the feel of the Nook.  I find the screen to be very readable.  The weight of the Nook is just right to me; I do NOT want a reader that is ""as light as a feather;"" I like something that feels like I'm actually holding something.Four, I've found customer support helpful.  Most of the time when I've had an issue or problem, I've been in a B&N; store and the representative has been able to help me.  On the phone, I've not experienced unduly long wait times.Now the not so good points.  One, there is no option to create folders in Nook.  I would like to be able to create folders for my downloaded books, for example, ""Fiction,"" ""Non-Fiction,"" etc., as well as the PDF articles that I put into Nook, such as ""economics,"" ""commentary,"" ""history,"" etc.  I do not like opening either the ""Barnes & Noble Library"" or ""My Documents"" section and seeing a listing of dozens of books or articles.Two, I purchased an older title (""The Count of Monte Cristo"") from the B&N; store and find this book difficult to navigate.  When I push the turn page button, it either takes a long time to turn or I get a message that says something like ""Activity Reader is not Responding,"" and then gives me a ""Wait"" or ""Force Close"" option; I choose the ""Wait"" option and the page eventually turns.  I have not had that problem with any other books.  I suspect this problem is due to the book not being originally put into digital format,then being scanned to digital whereas the recent books were produced digitally making their navigation virtually (no pun intended) flawless.Third, and last, I play the chess game in the Nook.  When you've started a game and then back out of it, then go back into it, it of course resumes that game (again, I know that this is nothing unique to Nook).  However, sometimes when I go back into a saved game, am not able to move my pieces and have to start over again.So, in summary, I'm pleased with my Nook except with the few minor complaints above.",4.0,"Very, Very Good But Not Perfect",1312070400,"07 31, 2011",Electronics,1.0

It replaces the keyboard on the Kindle with a color touch screen about the size of the iPhone display. This makes it easy to maneuver between  the store, your library, your current book, the daily (with messages, newsletters, and other free content), and settings. The LCD display changes from menu items to images of book covers to a keyboard as needed, and then turns off when reading.You can connect by both WiFI and free 3G to download a purchase in seconds, and connect with WiFi to get content and other offers when you walk into a B&N; store. I'm using the latest 1.1.1 SW release that fixes most of the issues noted in early reviews. Updates are done automatically over the air.The nook feels great in the hand with a slightly contoured back that adds a little thickness for the hand to grip. Controls are provided for equal usability by a left or right-hander person. The back is removable and replaceable with different colors. They are all rubber coated to make it less likely to drop. Unlike the Kindle the battery is replaceable and the memory is expandable. The e-ink display is the same type, but appears to be slightly crisper than the Kindle 2. The nook supports  EPUB (Non or Adobe DRM), PDB (Non DRM), PDF, Graphics: JPG, GIF, PNG, BMP, Audio: MP3, PDB. The online B&N; bookstore has about a million books compared to the Kindle store with half that, the major difference being the free public domain books provided by Google.Summary:While it costs the same as the Kindle, the nook is loaded with extra features: WiFi, color LCD, removable battery, expandable memory, more open book formats.

I tried to be open minded about it. I like having a book in my hand so that I can go back to a page that I want to review, or have a magazine in hand so that I can flip through to pick out the articles that I want to read.  In addition, it has to be held just right in order to see the words.  I tend to read while lying on my back, and without a backlight for the text, it is difficult to see.  In addition, the navigation system cuts off so quickly that I am constantly having to turn it back on when I am using it.  When I used it to read to my grandson, he left the room.

While the Kindle is clearly a superior product, (lighter, faster, easier to use and much longer battery life), I found the Nook okay at the price I paid.It was a little difficult to learn how to navigate with the touch screen and the set-up seemed ponderous, but once I got the hang of it, I've borrowed a book a week from the library.  The reduced price for the product was because someone had returned it and it presumably had been repaired.  I haven't found anything wrong with it and it looked new, unscratched and unmarked, so as a back-up to a Kindle, I'd recommend it.

FIND OUT HOW LONG YOU HAVE TO RETURN IT FOR A FULL REFUND, so that you can get your money back if it's defective.Jumbled Texts.  The first thing I purchased for my Nook was a newspaper.  Unfortunately, the articles were jumbled one with the other, so that they didn't make sense.  Confused, I took it into the B&N; store.  The salesman said, yes this sometimes happens.  He didn't even seem particularly surprised.  I asked for a refund. He said, there are no refunds for jumbled texts.  Ah.Battery.  I found that when I charged the battery, it lost power quickly, even when not in use.  I took it in.  The salesman kindly tested it for me, and said there is nothing wrong.  That was kind of him, but it didn't solve the problem.So I gave my Nook away and bought a Kindle, and have been happy ever since.  The staff at the Barnes and Noble bookstore are very friendly, but the company policy of how product problems are handled does not offer the customer refunds for defects; and it seems that defects are the norm.Imagine charging for a newspaper with jumbled text???  I don't know what was going on with the battery; perhaps the battery problem was user error?  If so, the product isn't very user-friendly.  I had no such problems with the Kindle.  No jumbled texts, and no batteries that discharge when the product isn't in use.Foreign Languages.  A third advantage to the Kindle is wide access to documents in other languages, both books and periodicals.  For example, you can purchase a Spanish/English dictionary for your Kindle, then purchase a Madrid newspaper in Spanish.  Point to a word, and up pops the definition in Spanish and English.

This is the second update to the Nook since launch.  All I can say is THANK YOU Barnes & Noble!The LCD screen improvements alone are GREAT!  With better looking icons, more responsiveness, and a sleeker appearance -- it makes me think of that McDonald's commercial: I'm lovin' it!Several of the well documented issues have been fixed, such as losing bookmarks due to powering off the unit -- which as it turns out was the most cited problem for Nook bashers and haters alike.  Nook haters will also be disappointed that the battery life has been optimized too.All-in-all if you've been waiting for the minor 1.0 issues to be fixed prior to purchasing the Nook you will not be disappointed in this newest version.  And if you have been considering switching from the Kindle you would be well advised to do so at this point.*****************************************************************************Updated 01/31/2010*****************************************************************************This device is clearly the best option on the market today, with it's LCD touchscreen, Wi-fi, memory expansion capabilities, and so, so much more. Let's ""wade in the weeds"" and look at some of the features in detail:LCD TouchscreenSo far this is the only mainstream reader to offer a LCD screen of any kind. The Coverflow-like book cover listing is beautiful, elegant, and functional. With the newest update it is uber fast, intuitive, and responsive. Page turns are super easy with the touchscreen, all you have to do is swipe the screen with one finger when it's in standby mode and the page turns.  In addition, it's easier for me to navigate books via the LCD than textually. Seeing the cover is a really nice feature, since books are designed to pique your interest by the cover. It just seems like a good cover sells a book, and seeing that cover in crisp LCD sells me from time to time.The keyboard is nice, any time a text field comes up you will have the keyboard pop up on queue. It's fast, responsive, and best of all doesn't look like a 1970's era fax machine keypad like some of the older readers on the market.Wi-fiThe built in Wi-fi is one of the great features of this device. Modern 3G speeds are pretty fast, but as most of us know that have smartphones, Wi-fi is about 100 times faster, especially when one tries to download large things, or a lot of content. The Wi-fi on this device is no exception... it's fast and super easy to set up. The on screen instructions are sooo clear to follow. I couldn't imagine only having 3G these days, like when you are in an area that doesn't have 3G coverage, you can still use the Nook over Wi-fi.  This is truly one of the killer features of the Nook.  You can go into a B&N; store and Wi-fi to your hearts content, but then come home and do the same.  Hotels offering free Wi-fi are the Nooks biach.Memory ExpansionThe Nook has a Micro-SD card slot which accepts up to 16GB Micro-SD cards, this allows you to upgrade your memory indefinitely. Another advantage would be to organize your books. And books on the card are never going to get lost if your reader dies -- without having to re-download from the cloud.  Plus with the new B&N; desktop reader you can move your books from the Nook to a laptop/netbook on the fly, and what if the worst should happen and your eReader dies?  You still have those books on the card.AppearanceThis is a biggy for me as it is for most people... I don't tend to buy or use things that look ugly. That's why I've got an iPod instead of a Zune, why I've got a LCD TV instead of a CRT, and now why I've got a Nook instead of another reader. The appearance of this device can be described with one word, SEXY. It just looks good. Other readers currently available range from looking ""not too bad"" to looking downright ugly. This reader is the exception to that rule and employs a host of features to boot.Book formats and availabilityThis is probably the biggest of all the features, since we are talking about a book reader, the Nook boasts a whopping 1,000,000 books available for it, in readily readable format, from just two sources (B&N; and Google). The nearest competitor only offers 500,000 books in it's native format (Kindle). You can convert many books to a Kindle readable format, but it's a hassle and you have to use your computer to do that. Sort of defeats the purpose of the wireless if you have to constantly connect to the PC. And there are third party sources for books in Kindle format, probably websites you've never heard of, new sites pop up all the time since Kindle has a big install base, but the quality of books on those sites is in question compared to a reputable company like Google.eInk displayIt seems to be crisper than much of the competition out there. The ability to change the typeface and size of the fonts is wonderful. The nearest competitors screen almost seems fuzzy in comparison, which for me makes it harder to read. Page changes are fast on the Nook, while nothing can compare with the speed of changing a real books' page, it's fast enough for the average person. Speed readers may find themselves waiting for a few milliseconds though. The controls on the Nook are straightforward and intuitive.Replacable batteryThis is another biggy for most ebook people, with the Nook you can change the battery out should you A) want extended reading times without charge, or B) if the original battery dies for some reason.  Many of the other readers on the market do not allow this, which means they are bricked if the battery dies and will either have to be repaired or replaced.Battery lifeA lot has been said about the battery life of the Nook, and other eReaders.  All of the manufacturers of these devices overstate the real world battery life in real world useage situations.  I have a co-worker with one of the Amazon (Kindle Brand) eReaders and he has to charge every 3 - 4 days.  Nook lasts for me about 5 - 7 days, but it all depends on what features you use on either or any of the devices and how much you use them to determine actual, real world battery usage. Either way, all of these devices are easy to charge.  Just plug into a standard 110 - 120 outlet and PRESTO!  Or in the case of the Nook, you can also plug into your computer/laptop/netbook and VOILA!  You will be on go in no time flat.Ease of useThe Nook is easy to set up and use, The onscreen keyboard is more familiar and similar to modern devices than many of the competitors setups.SummaryThere are so many features of this device it's hard to capture them all in one review. All in all this is one great device, with it's iPod like look and feel, large number of built in features, and industry standard operating system, it's clearly the choice of discerning electronics customers.*******************************Update*******************************So, I had been told on these comments that the B&N; in store functionality was not ready to be used yet -- another lie dispelled today.

I am bitterly disappointed in how the nook's functionality has been crippled and will return it. Hopefully Amazon, Sony and BN peruse these reviews and consumers may see some of the issues addressed.1. You cant manually set the clock.  BN assumes you will always have 3G access. If you travel or are out of a 3G area the time is wrong.  Seems like a small thing but it matters in a big way.  Not being able to manually set the clock is a genuine head scratcher.2. To drive consumers to the BN store and to the epub format BN has chosen to disallow basic functions with other 'supported' document formats.  I am an academic and this matters to me. I have thousands of PDF docs on my computer and immediately transferred a couple of hundred to the Nook only to discover that I have no ability to search, sort or order document formats other than epubs. My PDFs exist on the Nook only as a 'dumb' scrollable list. I cannot enter an author name or title and pull up the file. Neither can I alphabetize my PDF documents after they have been imported to the Nook.3. Following on from the above, BN has decided that while they will allow users to highlight, bookmark or make notes when reading they will not allow those functions if reading PDFs or any document format other than epubs.I cant perceive any logic in any of the above. Rather than having a satisfied customer who would come back to BN for epub purchases, I will have to return the nook because it doesn't offer basic functionality.",1.0,crippled features down this device,1263600000,"01 16, 2010",Electronics,0.0

The web browser only works on wifi.  Anyway, I really like the Nook. I bought a refurb from one of those daily deal sites for a very good price. I have only had it for about a week so I can't speak for it's reliability but I have loaded lots of free ebooks (what I bought it for) from various sources, some audio books for my kids, and some music.  I like the web browser and the sudoku game.  The only thing I would change if I could is to have an option to combine the ""my b&n library"" with ""my documents"" because when you get books from anywhere else besides B&N, it goes to your documents.  I would like to be able to pull up my ""mysteries"" shelf and be able to see all of my mysteries not just the ""documents"" set or the ""B&N"" set.

Maybe it's that I'm 21 and part of the Millennial Generation and can learn how to use most technology without too much difficulty.  I love my nook.  The screen is easy to read, it holds a library large enough for me to take a lifetime to read, the e-book store is easy to navigate, it has twice the library size of the kindle (yes, many of them are low quality scans from google books, but they are still readable and in most cases free), the color touch screen adds flair when appropriate and hides the keyboard when not in use (unlike the kindle), the screen looks like the page of an actual book, and the nook looks seamless in general.Alleged problems people have with the nook:Slow page turn and power on.Touch screen not sensitive enoughFrequent crashesCan't jump to specific pagesIn my experience, the page turn is not bad at all.  Perhaps it is a bit noticeable at first, but just like turning the pages of an actual book, you cease to notice it.  In fact the page turning takes no longer than turning actual pages and probably less.  If the lag does actually bother you, try pushing the button as you're on the last sentence.  The split second that it takes you to finish the sentence will be more than enough time for the nook to turn the page.  This may sound more complicated than you would like, but once you've done it a couple times it will become habit.The touch screen is easy enough to use most of the time.  The keyboard buttons are a tad small and occasionally hard to tap, but in general it's responsive.  It is nice that it hides the keyboard when not in use, unlike the eyesore keyboard of the Kindle.I've heard of frequent crashes on the nook, but I haven't experienced them.  Every once in a while the nook has trouble loading and formatting a book (this does not include starting where you left off on a book, that's just fine), but if you wait for a minute or so, it resolves itself.The nook cannot jump to a specific page number, but it does remember the farthest point you've reached in a book, and it does allow you to jump to specific chapters (and sometimes sections of chapters).  With a few clicks of the page turning buttons (or swipes of the touchscreen), you reach the page you're looking for.  So no significant trouble.Problems I have experienced:Slow Power OnSlow FormattingThe nook does take a while to power up and format books (only occurs when switching to a new book, the nook knows what you're currently reading and keeps your place).  I will admit these are probably the biggest problems with the nook, but in general they are not that hard to deal with.  A few seconds of patience never hurt anyone, and once you've loaded the book, you're off to the races.Overall, I recommend the nook.  It has everything one needs in an e-reader, it's fun to use, and has the biggest library selection available.P.S.  If you're considering the iPad instead of the nook or Kindle, don't.  The iPad's screen strains your eyes.  How many times have you gotten a headache from using a computer screen too often?

While I couldn't get my hands on a Kindle 3 to evaluate, I was familiar with the older Kindle 2 and how it feels/operates.  The other two current eReaders I could evaluate locally and run through their paces.The Sony reader was a nice size/weight and simple to use.  Unfortunately, the screen was hazy, due to the touch screen features being integrating into the reading screen.  The whole point of e-Ink is to give the best display for reading books.  A hazy screen failed that immediately.  Credit goes to the Sony for allowing me to read DRM ePub books from my local library; a big plus.  If there were no other reasonably priced eReaders that could do that, the Sony still might have had some consideration.  For the price, the Nook below had the same features and much more to offer.  Three years ago this might have been it; but not now.The Kindle 3, from everything I read, was a vast improvement over the Kindle 2.  Not that the K2 was bad, but the K3 just made it all the more better.  Without relisting all the pluses of the K3, I'll just jump to what ruled the K3 out:  No DRM ePub support for my local library.  I want to expound on why this really is important!  At first, I added five books to my queue from Amazon that really interested me.  They were priced reasonably; and had I bought the K3, they would have been purchased too.  Next, I went to [...] and logged in with my library book card.  [...] had three of those eBooks available for free check-out from my library.  Had I bought the K3, none of those local library eBooks could have been checked out because the Kindle is NOT supported by local libraries using DRM ePub.  I'm not talking about all those ""free"" eBook web sites that let you download classics from 100 years ago. I'm talking about recently released eBooks that can be checked out from your local library for free; my library uses [...] for this service.  DRM ePub books are licensed/restricted for checkout and can't be converted to a Kindle.  As far as the remaining two books that weren't available from the local library for eBook checkout, I priced them between Amazon vs Barnes and Noble.  The B&N; eBooks were cheaper, BUT...in all fairness, I've seen it go the other way with other eBooks that where cheaper at Amazon.  In this case, it was in favor of B&N.;  Final point against all versions of Kindle:  The mechanical keyboard hanging off the bottom.  While not distracting from reading books, and somewhat useful for the rare task outside of reading eBooks, it gives them the look of an oversized calculator and not an electronic book.  Of course, this is purely aesthetic; and to some isn't an issue.  When compared to a Nook, it does stands out.Because of the harsh Nook reviews on the buggy software, lock-ups, and sluggish performance listed in the early releases of the Nook software, I went ahead and read the online manual to learn all the advanced features of the Nook.  I wanted to walk into B&N; and just drill the dickins out of the Nook to see if it could perform; giving it no mercy. Upon walking into the store, I grabbed the first Nook reader I could find.  At first blush, the Nook had an excellent size/weight to me.  It was more rounded than the Sony and the shape fit my hands nicely. Then, I proceeded to use the color touch screen controller and work every feature.  The touch screen responded without a hitch and I found it easy to dive into every function of the Nook.  I selected various eBooks, which took about 5-15 seconds each to load up.  The page turn buttons seemed a little stiff at first, but I had been concerned that these same buttons might get accidentally pushed while holding the Nook.  That wasn't going to happen, so a little stiffness on the buttons was welcome.  The page turns seemed fast.  About two seconds at most to display the next page. The text was very clear with e-Ink at any angle. It was also easy to change the font to other sizes. One thing I found was the dictionary being slightly difficult to access. You have to scroll the feature-list down in the color touch screen first, pick the dictionary choice, and then you can go high-light a word to look up.  Of course, the scroll-list stays where you last left it, so future dictionary lookups are quicker.  I went through all the other features and found nothing surprising or limiting.  No lock-ups, no slowness, etc...  It just worked.  The firmware version was 1.4 on this Nook.  At the time of this review, I believe it is the latest version.  Everything seemed solid; software and hardware.  I bought it (WiFi only model).At home, I setup the Wi-Fi access to my home network.  I had to type in the encryption password using the keyboard feature on the color touch display. It is trickier than using a mechanical keyboard.  Yet, I'm a fairly large guy with big fingers and had little problem typing in the information.  I missed some keys now and then, but was able to quickly use the backup key and correct.  A light finger touch is all that is needed to use this keyboard!  Nook registration with B&N; was simple and uneventful.  Now, the critical feature:  DRM ePub support using [...] to access my local library eBooks.

I read nonstop and loved being able to get almost any book whenever I wanted. I bought my first( keyword) nook 3G at the end of May 10' for $260( it went down to $199 the next week, gotta love that). It worked just fine for about 2 months then it just stopped downloading books. So I thought maybe I was in a bad spot or something. It wouldn't connect anywhere except in Barnes&Noble( of course) so I called tech support and was on the phone for an hour and they had no idea how to fix it, they told me to just go to store( pawning me off) I went to the store and retold the whole story to them only to be asked a million questions making me feel like they thought I was trying to pull a fast one. Finally they just gave me a new one( I was happy, all I wanted was one that worked) So I got my second one on Sept 4 and it also worked fine for about 3 weeks then... as thing happened. Called tech support and same thing again they didn't know and pawned me off on the store. I called store and said I just want my money back I don't want another, they don't do what your store says they will end of story. So I'm about to go to store right now and hopefully get my money back.I figure that after two not working I gave them more than enough chances to fix whatever is wrong with the thing.

I wanted an eReader for portability and easy access to books, and the Nook delivers in full.It has a pretty decent battery life (I'd recommend airplane mode unless you're actually downloading), is super simple to load books/documents from a computer, and looks/feels great. I'm currently in law school, and have numerous PDFs from various classes loaded onto it. Reading from an eReader is way easier on the eyes than constantly staring at a computer screen (and it costs the same as a single casebook).I like the Nook's touchscreen interface; it can be a little slow at times, but I haven't had any major issues with it. One of my biggest factors for buying a Nook over a Kindle/Sony was that Barnes & Noble is a BOOKSELLER. This device is designed with book readers in mind. The fact that I can loan eBooks from the library, read eBooks for free while at Barnes & Noble, and the overall design of the thing (multiple options for turning pages, I like to swipe the touchscreen vs. pushing the buttons) put the Nook far out in front. The fact that Barnes & Noble gives you 2 weeks to try the thing out put it over the edge. I initially bought the Wi-fi only version and it froze after the second day, I exchanged it for the Wi-fi/3G at the store no questions asked.Overall it's a great product and awesome for those that actually like books, not just having the latest gadget.",5.0,happy I went with the bookstore's ereader,1288051200,"10 26, 2010",Electronics,1.0

Pressing the button to change pages was not as easy as it should be. Also, it kept freezing on me, and finally got to the point that it would just reboot over and over, and stopped working. So I shopped for a new one. After the price drop, I started looking even more seriously. In terms of style, I do not see how anyone could prefer the Kindle over the Nook. However, style should never be the most important thing. Outside of that, I cannot speak for using a Kindle, because I haven't.However, compared to the sony, the pages turn a little quicker. It came with firmware 1.4, so never had the initial issues. Purchasing books is very easy. Battery is decent with 3g on, and excellent with it off. I think the color screen uses a little extra juice, but once you start reading a book, you don't really need to use the screen. Plenty of storage with option to add more. What's not to like?The one comparison I will make is this: Epub v. Kindle DRM.  You can buy epub books from many sources and rent library books. Yes, you can convert the library books to work on kindle, but why should you have to???  I basically equate the way the kindle does their DRM to ITUNES. Apple has a great product, but they are basically trying to make everyone use a ipod, because once you have bought songs on itunes, it is a pain to get them to work on another MP3 player. Same goes for buying books from amazon. Too restrictive. In a way, the ipod is better, because at least it will play music you buy from somewhere else. The kindle won't. At least, not without converting it. This is the primary reason I never even seriously considered a Kindle.",5.0,"Probably would give 4.5 stars, but rounded up",1289952000,"11 17, 2010",Electronics,1.0

After spending a considerable amount of time researching and reading about all of my options, I decided that the Nook Simple Touch with Glow Light is my best option.  I even went to Best Buy to physically compare them and speak with other users.  I spend time in Barnes & Noble stores (in Raleigh, NC and New York City) to get opinions from customer who already had the Nook to get their opinions.  As my purpose for getting this item was mainly for travel (I am embarking on a 1-2 year trip around the world), I thought given the weight, size and the glow light factor, this item would be perfect for reading on planes, hostel rooms, buses, etc.I first ordered the Nook Simple Touch through the website, as they were sold out in all the stores.  During that time, I wanted to buy a subscription for THE ECONOMIST. Barnes & Noble had a Father's Day Special (1yr for $99).  Before purchasing the time, I asked the staff if this subscription worked on the Nook Simple Touch....they assured me it did, as the requirement mentioned Nook Android systems and that's what the Simple Touch used.  Upon receiving my Nook, I called CS to ask about getting my starting my subscription.  Apparently the description for Android system only applied to the color tablets.  A simple misunderstanding.  No problem.After using the Nook Simple Touch for about a week, I noticed ""pinpoints"" when I used the glowlight.  I called CS about it and they said they didn't know what I was talking about but will send a replacement.  As I was leaving the country in 2 weeks, I was concerned about the the timing.  they assured me that it will arrive on time. This was on June 15.June 16, I went to visit a Barnes & Noble store and just inquired about my pinprick issue and a staff member said it was a well reported and known bug and BN would be happy to replace it.  I mentioned that the CS said they've never heard about and the BN store staff thought it was strange since the Nook Simple Glow Touch had two major issues and this was one of them.  Is CS lying to me or are they just unimformed?  I dind't worry, since I was getting a new one anyway.June 21, I stil l haven't received my replacement NOR any notice of shipping of the item.  I called the CS line and they said it's ""enroute"".  I ask ""does that mean it's on it's way? It's already left and in the middel of shipment?"".  they confirm and provide me with a tracking number.  I hang up and try the tracking number with UPS, USPS, FedEx, DHL...no record.  I try again the next day....stil no record.June 22, I call back to customer serivce and they confirm the tracking number and assure me again that I'll recieve my package before I leave the country.  I stay on the phone asking them to help me track it.  Spend some time on hold....the CS person gets back to me and says that it hasn't left the warehouse yet, but it will withink the next 24-48 hours and be assured that I'll get it in the next 7 days. I ask him if there's a note that I'm leaving the country. She confirms yes, it says that I need it before the end of June.  I ask if the itme leaves in 48 hours (june 24), how can I get it before June 30? (my departure date is July 1)?She says no problem it'll arrive within 7 days.  She just seems to be saying things wtihout really listening. I actually had to make her do the math....24+7=31.  so it would arrive on June 31...but ther is no such thing as June 31...so will I get it on time....then she says I might have an isssue.  By this time my frustration is over the top. I ask if I can FedEx it. She's not sure so she'll call me back with an answerJune 25, still didnt' hear anything back from them and during this time, I'm checking with BN stores in NYC to see if I can just replace it myself here.  But this item is on backorder.  And I need permissino from CS to do this and that can take time.June 26, I call BN CS for an update. Still hasn't left the warehouse.  I complain and the guy escalates me to Level 2.  I explain my situation and I get escalated to Level 3.  They seem to make it sound importnat that I'm up so high on the Levels, but really no one's doing anything.  I get to a Level 3 CS person. I'm on hold for another 20 minutes. During that time, I'm calling all the Barnes & Noble store in Manhattan to see if I can just replace it at the store. One store and one item left in stock, I ask teh store manager to hold it for me under my name and explain to him that I'm on the phone with CS. He agrees.  Level 3 manger gets back on the line and he doesn't know what to do. I tell him I found a store i can go to, to exchange it but he needs to call the up for approval.  No probem. He puts me on hold...I'm holding and then the Barnes & Noble store picks up.  Seems that the Level 3 manger didnt' know the difference between putting someone on hold and forwarding the call.  I explain the situation with a different manager at the same store. The two managers talk to each other and agree it's ok to come into exchange it.  At the store, things go smoothly, but I have to pay an extra $2.14 since I bought mine in Raleigh adn I'm in NYC and they have a higher tax.  (ugh)June 27, After charging up the new Nook, I test it out and it seems to be no problem with it. I call CS back to cancel my repalcement order. I talk to CS again and they confirm it still hasn't left the warehouse.  Do I have time to cancel it? Since I'm leaving in 4 days and I already have my replacement.  No problem they say.  So I cancel the replacement order.July 6, I""m in Beijing, China now.  I get an email from Barnes and Noble that they need information to cancel my replacement order or else I'll be charged (on my credit card) for an extra Nook.  I give them my serial number and say I've already cancellled this over a week ago and the CS says no problemJuly 7, BN write back (via email) that it's too late to cancel and I can just send the replacement item back. I write to them that I am no longer in the US and will not be able to ""return to sender""Am I wrong to be frustrated or upset?The item itself is great, but given the trouble and frustrations and the time I spend waiting with customer service, I think the Kindle is a better value.",2.0,"Great Product, Customer Support is horrible, maybe not worht the issues",1341532800,"07 6, 2012",Electronics,0.0

I actually waited until the Nook Color was announced before opening the box - I wanted to see what the new gadget had to offer and if it'd be worth trading mine in.There were some rumors that the Nook Color would feature a screen with Mirasol technology, and I was disappointed to learn that it actually had an LCD screen coated with something to reduce glare. I state at an LCD screen all day at work, and don't want to do the same while reading. Plus, I'm not sure how well the LCD screen would fare in the sun and I'm interested to hear feedback from Nook Color owners.I think the color screen matters if you want to read a lot of magazines, or textbooks, or kids' books, none of which I'll be doing. Nook Color also stores more books (6000) and allows the reader to send updates to Facebook and Twitter directly from the eReader. Personally, I didn't find any of these extra features particularly appealing, so I'm happily sticking with the original Nook.My Observations/Pros of the Nook-It's bigger than I expected, in a good way. It's not heavy, but has a nice ""significant"" feel to it.-I think few people realize how clear and book-like the e-Ink screen actually is. I showed the Nook to some friends, and that was the first thing they noticed.-The bottom LCD touch-screen adds a little oomph with the color buttons and book covers.-Getting ePub books from the public library has been surprisingly easy, although you have to connect the Nook to a computer in order to transfer the ePub files.-I've been enjoying the Nook Facebook group where administrators post a free eBook every Friday.-The instructional videos online are very helpful in getting started with the Nook.Cons-BN.com has a Free NookBooks section, but for some reason, not all the free eBooks are listed. I saw some Kindle titles that were available for free, and when I searched on BN.com, turns out they were free there as well.-I didn't care much about the LendMe feature of the Nook, but it was still disappointing to learn that not all purchased eBooks can be lent out. Publishers control which titles can be used for lending, and each book can only be lent out once....ever.-The PDF manual for the Nook is very confusing and can benefit from some serious editing.-There are definitely more Kindle books than NookBooks available, but I hope that will change in the near future.All in all, I am pretty happy with the Nook and I think the fact that it supports a wider range of eBook formats outweighs many of the cons.

Before this I had a Nook Color and it was just okay, I hardly ever used it. I would have given this 4.5 stars if possible. What's keeping it from a full out 5 star for me is the lack of camera and video capabilities. I understand it's main purpose is for reading but it does so much more than that (it has the Google Play store) and I use it for so much more that it just seems like a full on tablet to me and would be even better with a camera.At the time I was looking into buying one I found out that it has the highest resolution screen of any tablet this size. And, it is awesome. Streaming videos is great and playing games is a good experience. My son (3) loves to play games on this and it comes in handy when we're out and about and he wants something to do. This is the perfect size for portability. It's also not too heavy when holding it to read or browse the web for longer periods of time. I haven't set up a different profile for my son yet, which I should do, so I can't say for sure how well that function works. I have not had any issues with it so far and I'm really enjoying it quite a bit. It still has all the nice features for reading books too (highlighting, dictionary, etc).

Sold it last fall and got 1 girl a Kindle Fire 2nd gen, and the other a Lenovo A2107. The Lenovo was absolutely horrid so I wanted to replace it. This summer, when the Nook HD got Google Play, and the prices fell, I sold the Lenovo and got my daughter the Nook HD 16gb Snow. She absolutely loves it! I liked it so much, I got the Nook HD 8gb for myself. I like it much better than my Kindle Fire HD. The size is smaller, and thinner, and lighter, which are great things. And you can put whatever wallpaper you want on it, unlike the Fire HD.I sold the 2nd gen Kindle Fire and gave the other daughter the Fire HD, but she has since switched to a Nook also (HD+). So now I have the Fire HD and the Nook HD for myself. I like the Nook HD better for the reasons stated above. Size and weight are so much smaller on the Nook HD. The screen resolution is also better. There is nothing I don't like about the Nook HD. I did put a GreatShield Glare Screen protector on the Nooks, to reduce the shiny glare. We use them without cases, just sleeves. They are phenomenal tablets.If you or the person you are buying for loves to play games and will likely download hundreds of them, definitely get the 16gb Nook HD. You will want as much space for apps as you can afford, despite the SD card slot. Games have to be installed to internal memory, for the most part. The SD card slot comes in handy for books, movies, photos and music. I got the 8 gb Nook HD for myself, because I don't play games, the only apps I need are for reading, playing music, news, web, stuff like that. I put my files on the SD card and I am set!I don't plan to buy the new Fires when they come out.  They are far too limited, in my opinion. (So was the Nook, of course, until they added Google Play). I have ADW Launcher on all three of the Nooks, though my daughters tend to prefer the standard Nook launcher. What shows up on that home page can be customized to show only what you want it to show. There is also an ""app drawer"" icon that shows the most recently opened apps for easy launching.

I had a Nook Color for 3 years and didn't have a single problem with it until the battery charge indicator started to malfunction, which is when I purchased the HD.

As a tablet, it's quick, easy to navigate, and has a spectacular picture. I find it very user-friendly and intuitive to download books, read, and organize my book ""shelves."" I also appreciate being able to download books from Project Gutenberg and other free sites and the public library directly onto the Nook using the Wi-Fi feature instead of having to use a USB cord to plug into my computer. You can also rent or buy movies to watch on the spectacular HD screen.I enjoyed the experience of going to a store and seeing the different Nooks that are offered and asking questions from the representatives there. I can't imagine purchasing an e-reader without touching it, feeling it, and testing it out before deciding which one I wanted.  If you're debating between the Simple Touch and the HD, I would recommend the HD: you get a tablet for the price of an e-reader, you don't have to use your computer to ""sideload"" content from sites other than B&N;, and you get a much crisper and more legible reading screen that you can read in the dark at night.I don't think that I'll ever be without a Nook in the future.  I thought that I was married to actual books, but the Nook really captures the book experience. It's like having an entire library at your disposal in the comfort of your own home.

I think the 7"" screen is too small for me. I wish it was 8 or 9 inches. However in the overall the Nook Tablet seems nice. I am still exploring all its features.  I find there is a total lack of instruction of how to use them. For example photo transfer from phone to Nook or from Mac to Nook.  There are 2 places were to allocated photos: Gallery and Photos.  The Gallery seems linked directly to a google account. I am still struggling to get through this.  I want to customize the tablet better for my personal use, and I am still learning, thus for the time being I will give it 4 stars.Not all screens of the tablet can be zoomed in either and this is very bad. Barnes and Nobles books reviews about e-books is one of them and this is why I wished I had a larger screen.I have NOT used the Barnes & Noble library download feature, I use Kindle app instead.The e-mail set up is also annoying as well. It assumes user has a gmail account and setting up different emails is not easy. I have fixed this by directly using webmail account access.Not all apps are  available for Nook tablet either. Some of them (quite popular ones as well) are only available for iPad or android phone. I do not understand why since this is an android platform they do not work with Nook. This is something hard to determine previous the purchase of the tablet and until in need of a specific app. Perhaps not necessarily the fault of the tablet manufacturer, but still irritating.I will leave a better detailed review when I learn all the features of the tablet.***UPDATE April 22.2014The more I use the Nook the more I dislike this tablet. I originally graded it 4 stars but a series of technical problems is forcing me to give it 3 stars.Kindle app continuously freezes or crashes.  Tablet reading feature lights up  as problem as well: it seems to get stuck on a low light dim mode and needs to be adjusted frequently.  Since Barnes & Noble library availably of selection is much inferior to the Amazon one in many ways including price of ebooks, Kindle is a must for avid readers.WhatsUp app is not compatible for this tablet either.Skype app works with the Nook but it is almost useless since the tablet lacks of camera. This is NOT a feature I was looking for initially, but I am now.I even downloaded a free office/document program called King Office, which isn't that bad.The tablet syncs automatically with the contact list of android phone but doesn't recognize a cable connection for photo transfer between the phone and tablet.  I truly dislike the sync part where my contacts are displayed on the tablet. I had to manually hide and remove that option.Google+ and Google icons along with Gmail icons populate the tablet and this is also very annoying.  I am still trying to figure out how to completely eliminate that.I will continue to update as I use it but my opinion about this tablet is that if you are looking to go beyond the e-reader use you are going to be somewhat disappointed.",3.0,Some problems,1396396800,"04 2, 2014",Electronics,0.0

No, that honor belongs to its bigger brother the Nook HD+ which gives you a device that's just as capable as the Kindle HD 8.9"" tablet with an almost $80 price difference, however, that doesn't mean the Nook HD is without value at it's current price sticker of $129.The Kindle HD sits at a similar pricing and sports a processor that's slightly more powerful but the display on the Nook device cannot be beat. iPad Retina displays are touted as an experience that's not too taxing on your eyes while giving you a beautiful picture but at a costly price, whereas the B&N; Nook tablet has a comparable, if not sharper, display at a pricing that can be considered a bargain. It looks beautiful while reading, flipping through comics, or watching movies and I've yet to see anything in it's price range look better. Plus, I love the addition of a micro SD slot to the Nook because it allows for rooting and customization that might not be allowed on other tablets.It does a serviceable job for gaming and everything I've put it through on the Google Play app store runs perfectly fine. In fact, I haven't noticed a drop in performance or noticeable difference when comparing it to my first gen Google Nexus 7. I'd imagine it would have difficulties with some of the newer games that are optimized for Tegra 4, for example but lacking a proper benchmark or killer app to test it with in that department I've concluded that it would do a wonderful job for most people's needs.It has a few downsides, in that it needs a proprietary cable, the battery life lasts around only 8-10 hours which isn't great, and while I haven't experienced it firsthand I've heard that B&N; customer service is positively awful. In addition, the back of the device tends to get hot after a while which hasn't impacted it's functionality during my personal use but it indicates that it might be a problem in the future, which isn't reassuring while using electronics in an age where failure rates tend to be higher.Overall, it's a great little tablet with a lot to like about it. There's a lot of stiff competition at similar prices but I'd consider looking into the Nook to see if it fits your needs.Update: I've since tried the system with the game Bladeslinger which I'm told is a pretty good test to see how well your system handles games, and barring the inordinately long load time the actual gameplay runs smooth.",4.0,Rooting for the Barnes and Noble underdog,1386460800,"12 8, 2013",Electronics,1.0

Love the clarity of print for the e-books.  There are more apps for it than I have had time to explore.  I can carry books, my Bible, and internet access with me, all in a very small case.  And I can download my granddaughter's favorite games.  Awesome!",5.0,Enjoying my Nook HD Tablet!,1396483200,"04 3, 2014",Electronics,1.0

However, you cannot install the amazon appstore and I had to buy some of the apps from Google play that I had originally purchased. There are no ads with the nook. Even with the Fathers day sale (which put the Kindle no-ad version at 195), this is cheaper by 65 bucks. An additional benefit is you can add an external SD card and there are options to boot a full blown standard Android Jellybean from the SD card with the nook from places like (AFN - android for nook for just 10 bucks).The two main downsides are that it lacks a front facing camera, but I really have no use for that and the parental controls are not that easy to set as in the Kindle (you can create a child profile and make sure that the password has to be entered, but I have not fully figured it out).I liked it so much that I bought a second nook in smoke color today.",5.0,Best performance and unbeatable value in 7inch tablet,1371945600,"06 23, 2013",Electronics,1.0

I had to replace my first one with a no hassle easy and quick replacement. I did have to send mine back first. But It would no turn on anyway so I couldn't use it. The replacement has lasted longer. But sometimes the WiFi turns on by itself. Sometimes it's just flighty about picking up signal no matter where I am, this happens in phases, especially after I have had to erase and deregister it. I have had to do that six times with this one, in order to get things to work properly. The Bluetooth drains the battery even though it is off. (I own a off brand Bluetooth keyboard, which may have began that problem). These problems drain the battery quite quickly so I my batter doesn't last. And my chargers are quite new.

If you think you are getting the same type of speedy 7"" tablet as a Nexus 7 (especially the 2013 refresh), you are going to be disappointed.  First off, it's an older model.  Second, it's got different internal components, which is why you can get it for under $120. Lastly, the Nook launcher/overlay is just more of an obstacle than a help.2. It's still a great value, IF you are planning on using it for reading, watching Netflix or Hulu, or for CONSUMING media.  It's not a creation-based device, but so few people create content, I think the market is still there for this device.3. Throw in a 16 or 32 GB microSD card and enjoy a LOT more room for your own media than what Nexus or Apple will give you in one of there devices. I went with the 8GB device and now have almost 40 with the expandable memory.4. It's a comfortable device to use, especially if you are already on the Google ecosystem. The only app I really miss having is MLB At Bat, but if you were to root and install an alternate operating system, it might work.  I can't speak to that. I can, however, tell you Google Books, Google Music, and virtually everything else I use for apps works on this device.So, is it worth $120? Yes. Is it the fastest, shiniest, coolest Android tablet on the market? No. That one is going to cost you more than $120.

I was a little disappointed at first (on the &#34;Nook&#34; side of the dual boot) with the audio as watching concert videos on YouTube, etc did not seem to go very loud, but the quality was quite good.  The earphone jack seemed a little loose at first and stereo did not seem to be working as it should to both earphones.  Come to find out, you have to really jam the plug in to the earphone jack pretty hard..I just didn't have them in all the way (this helped with the stereo issue above, but not the volume.  Also had issue with downloading from my Windows Media Player onto the Nook as some files would download and some would not.  Dual - booted to the &#34;Android&#34; (micro sd card) and WOW!!!  The volume, sound is absolutely AMAZING on YouTube, music files, etc....Everything.Still had issues downloading and playing all music files from Windows media player as .wma files simply would not download and play.  Ultimatley purchased &#34;PowerAmp&#34; music player for $3.99 ( you can get a free version for 2 week trial) and once again, WOW!!!wma files all play great from my Nook player, the sound quality is EXCELLENT.Reading is wonderful on this tablet as it should be.  Using the AFN card I have access to Amazon, Amazon mp3 store, Kindle books...anything and everything I could possibly need or want.  Have other stuff on the &#34;Nook&#34; side.No camera...no problem.  I'm a little perplexed by other reviewers who get their Nook HD and take away from their rating because of the lack of a camera.  Do a little research people!  I knew about 10 minutes in to researching this tablet that it had NO CAMERA!  Not B&N;'s fault you don't do your DD.For twice the price this would be a good buy.  For the price we got on Black weekend i am absolutely thrilled!!

{'$oid': '5a13242d741a2384e88f4929'},AJUVE7TE62LHD,1400698987,Slydawg,"[33, 34]","I picked up the Nook HD yesterday from B&N;, they still had plenty in stock at my local store.  With the price drop they had down to $79 (might have been temporary for Black Friday weekend) I ran out of excuses not to buy it.  I'm still using my old Nook color as an ereader and this price I couldn't resist getting a nice upgrade.Here is what is great about this tablet, you get a decent stock operating system now that B&N; allows access to the Google Play store and apps.  Right out of the box, it is very nice already.  But for tinkerers like myself, the best thing is to set it up with a custom Android ROM, there is a great one called Cyanogenmod 10.1 - this is basically a stock Android 4.2.2 set up to run on the Nook HD - gives you an interface and user experience much like what you get on the new model Nexus 7.  I requires some computer skills and a 4GB or bigger microSD card, took me about 30 minutes to do.There are plenty of tutorials/directions online, it is not terribly difficult for anyone who is even mildly computer savvy.  The most important thing to do for the sake of being able to go back to stock - for warranty or any reason - is to use a recovery tool to first back up the stock B&N; ROM before you flash the tablet with the custom ROM.  The same recovery program that I used to flash the custom ROM has an option right in the menu to create a backup of the stock ROM right onto the microSD card, pretty easy.While I decided to completely overwrite the stock B&N; ROM, there is also an option to set up a microSD card with a custom ROM and you can then basically dual-boot and not even affect the stock B&N; ROM.  Take out the SD card and reboot the tablet and you are back to a totally stock Nook HD.  Again, plenty of tutorials online that explain how to go about doing all of this stuff.Functionally the Nook HD with Cyanogenmod 10.1 is probably 90% of what the 2013 Nexus 7 does at less than half the cost.  The biggest glaring difference is the lack of any cameras, it has neither front or back - but to be honest I never used them on the several years that I have owned tablets except for a couple of times to Skype.  For photos and video I whip out the phone, which is always in my pocket, better sized for that purpose, and equipped with far superior camera lenses and sensors.  The Nook HD with my custom ROM is running a fairly new Android version and is sufficiently fast enough for anything I need it to do, read books, play games, web surf, Netflix, etc.  The screen resolution on the Nook HD is just right for a 7 inch tablet, as somebody who has also owned/owns a Nexus 10, Samsung GS4, and Moto X, I can tell you that anything above 250 ppi starts to really get to a point of diminishing returns.  The added sharpness is barely perceptible and you need a lot more horsepower from your device to power the screen plus you incur more battery drain.On the Nook HD, I can load a full webpage and read text pretty comfortably without having to zoom in.  This is very serviceable for doing just about anything but a high resolution 9"" to 10"" screen is definitely the better way to go for frequently viewing larger content like webpages and digital magazines.  This serves my purpose better since my priority was a lighter and smaller tablet that I slide in the back pocket and can easily hold in one hand to read books, etc.The obvious point I am trying to make is that for $80-$100, you will not find a better 7"" tablet, especially if you mod it with a good Android ROM.  In summary, I'll list out the positives and negatives at the end of this review.  Most of the negatives are honestly minor especially when factoring price, but I'll be critical and point out every little thing that I have observed.  Take the negatives with a grain of salt, I am still rating this as a 5 star product.I would love to be able to really solidify this review further by comparing this directly with the Kindle Fire HD but I'm not sure that is even necessary.  Even without having used a Kindle Fire HD, I find the Nook HD to be a likely easy winner between the two since it is typically cheaper, has a higher resolution screen, slightly faster CPU, offers a microSD slot, and is less locked down even in stock form now that the stock B&N; ROM lets you into the Google Play store (the Kindle Fire HD can also be tweaked to do this and of course you can go the full route of installing a custom ROM on that as well).  You don't lose any of the great Amazon stuff with this tablet.  Download the Kindle app and you can buy and read books through Amazon's Kindle store.  Download the Boat Browser from the Google Play store, turn on the flash plugin in settings, and you can watch Amazon Prime videos.Okay, enough said - here's the summary:PROS:-Price, as long as it is being sold for ~$100 or less.-Sufficiently powerful CPU/hardware specs to do most everything without any noticeable lag or performance issues.  Very zippy with the custom ROM I installed (Cyanogenmod 10.1).  Video playback is excellent, I'm able to stream 720p on my network without issues.-Excellent screen, color and sharpness is superb, gets as bright as I need it to indoors in any lighting (have not tested outdoors).-Build quality seems good, tablet feels tight and solid overall, buttons feel tight and solid also.-Touchscreen is accurate and responsive.-Light and comfortable to hold, soft concave rubberized back is very nice.-Stereo speakers are rear facing but suitably loud and clear sounding without my having to do the 'hand cupping' to direct the sound forward.-MicroSD card slot means you can expand memory up to 64GB or run custom ROMs without having to permanently install them.-Proprietary charging cable has a larger much more robust connector than the flimsy microUSB plug most android tablets use (which I hate despite the advantage of being 'universal' and cheap to replace).CONS:-Having to use an flashed or SD card based custom ROM to get rid of the B&N; limited version of android and get the full android experience (not everyone can or wants to do this).-No cameras-MicroSD card slot cover is total crap, takes a lot of effort to pry open and you feel like you will end up tearing it off by mistake.  Fortunately most people won't need to mess with it more than a few times - once you have your microSD card in there it can be left alone.-Shiny plastic they used around the outer edge of the bezel and the microSD slot cover looks really cheap.  Fortunately the front part of the bezel (which is probably the same plastic) has a nicer looking matte finish.  Design is dull and simple looking.  Not thick but not exactly super thin or 'svelte' looking.-Volume buttons are a little awkward due being positioned a little too close to the corner for comfort and also being tilted away from the index finger because of the beveled angle of the bezel, plus they take a bit of effort to depress.-Proprietary charging cable and it will not charge from computer USB port apparently - because of this it is probably a good idea to buy a spare cable but they are still way overpriced.-Proprietary HDMI adapter for video output is also expensive, way overpriced.",5.0,"Probably the best 7"" tablet choice right now (Dec 2013)",1385856000,"12 1, 2013",Electronics,1.0

For me it fit all my needs without needing a loan to buy one.  I ordered my direct from B & N for $179.00.  It came pre registered in my wifes account who has the nook color.  It is very easy to create your own profile and not see all the junk your spouse has but, at the same time can pick what you want that they have.  No need to repurchase what they already have.What Barnes and Nobel doesn't really want you to know is that you can put Amazon's Kindle app on the nook and read Kindle books (both free and purchased from Amazon).  I also noted that, with the Kindle app, you can adjust the fonts and resize PDF documents that you cannot do on the nook when reading PDF's.Lets not forget its a 9 in screen.  Battery holds well at 10 hours.I bought a 32GB SD card and so far have put 15 movies ( and stiil room for many more) on the card to watch in HD. I choose to save the memory on the nook for books or other apps and watch my movies from the tiny SD micro card. Buy ""DVD Catalyst"" ( really cool program for $9.95)(can try it for free)on line to compress those movies from DVD and then it automatically puts it on the micro card.I seen some gripes about them adding Google store.  Not sure how you can complain about ading a whole another facet of apps.  IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT THEN DON'T ADD ANY GOOGLE APPS. Its still a free country.So for reading ebooks, movies, games, apps and many others all for $179.00, for me it hit my tickle spot.

The price is starting to creep up for a new one so keep your eyes open for a sale, but don't wait too long because they are no longer being manufactured.There are two primary reasons that I like the Nook HD+ 9"". First of course is the 1920 x 1280 high resolution display.  You will note that  by comparison 1080p is only 1920 x 1080 so this display is 4x3 not 16x9.  In my opinion the extra pixels make browsing web pages more pleasant in both portrait and landscape mode.  The second reason is that this tablet was sold in large numbers so developers have released ROM builds with the latest version of Android KitKat.  These can be used either by flashing the tablet's ROM internally or running KitKat from a micro SD Card and leaving the Nook's original operating system untouched.We have numerous Android devices and were able to download everything we needed for free, but their are companies who sell micro SD cards already set up for around $20.  So for a reasonable price one can get a ""rooted"" android tablet without doing much research and with almost no risk to the tablet or your warranty.This tablet was originally released in November of 2012.  It has a 1.5 GHz OMAP4470 Dual-Core Processor which is a little slower than the Samsung Exynos 4412 dual-core 1.5GHz processor found in the Galaxy Tab 3 8"" that was released in a few months later in mid 2013.  The processor is good enough to play most formats of HD Video, but struggles with games with 3D graphics.  It performs better with the rooted version of KitKat than with the stock Nook OS.We had a Galaxy Tab 3 8"" and now have a Galaxy Tab 4 8"".  They both have a very good GPS and cameras in the front and rear.  The Nook has neither of these features.  But the bigger display with 1920x1280 resolution as compared to 1280x800 on the Galaxy Tabs more than makes up for these shortcomings for most of what we use a tablet for.Many of these were sold so there is a very good support network.  Lots of accessories are available through Amazon and the other usual suspects.  The hardware has proven to be dependable despite a few people who have reported problems here.  They come with a good warranty and extended warranties are available.

I already have an Apple 4th generation iPad, but I couldn't resist on the high quality picture and low price.  After I received the Nook, I immediately rooted with Kit Kat, the latest operating system.  Let me tell you, I am glad that I made the move.  The original Ice Cream Sandwich OS has lag but not Kit Kat.  With Kit Kat, not only the Nook operates much more smoothly, you also get the full Android tablet experience and more apps available from Google Play.I recently stumbled across the XBMC Cine Player Android app in the Google Play store.  With this app, I can now stream over 1500 movies in HD quality for free.  I have been using XBMC for a little while now on both MacBook Pro and Raspberry Pi, though the Cine Player version's library is not as extensive as the MacBook Pro and Raspberry Pi, it is good enough for use when you are on the road like in a hotel or something.  With Kit Kat, I experience very little buffering issue. I can also output contents to a TV via the Nook HDMI adapter.  I believe you can output signal to a TV via Google Chromecast but I haven't tried it yet so I can't be for sure.I highly recommend the Nook if you root it with the latest OS.  I am finding more and more things that I can do with the Nook then the iPad due to Android is an open system.By the way, I use N2A to root my two Nook HD+'s.  With a N2A micro SD card, it gives you the dual boot capabilities.  You can use it to boot Kit Kat or the native Barnes and Noble OS without removing the card.  The N2A card doesn't replace the native OS as the Kit Kat OS is stored in the micro SD card so you don't have to be concerned about voiding the warranty from alternating the tablet OS.Bottom line, the Nook HD+ is already a pretty decent tablet.  One can greatly improve its potential with a simple change to the OS.  If front and back cameras and GPS are not necessities for you, the Nook is a good value tablet for 1/3 of the cost of an iPad.  By the way, I bought an external bluetooth GPS for $16 and it works like a charm with the Nook.  One can expect to spend $100 for an external bluetooth GPS if your IOS device doesn't come with an internal GPS.",5.0,Well worth every penny if rooted with Kit Kat,1400976000,"05 25, 2014",Electronics,1.0

It seemed like the best value at the time for a 32GB tablet.I thought that it would be good for our trip to Spain.  We ended up using it to watch a few movies on the plane and that was it.Fast forward a few months of neglecting using the Nook and the device will not even turn on.  I keep thinking that I am doing something wrong, but the next step is most likely going to be a trip to BestBuy after I confirm that I ordered the extended warranty (it's been a busy time for us!).So needless to say I am not impressed....UPDATE:Well, the Nook decided to Power on again when I followed the instructions to turn on a ""dead Nook"".  I don't have the instructions right here, but if you find them (has to do with pressing and holding two of the buttons at the same time), make sure to look at your screen very carefully because one of the options is to restore your Nook to factory settings - and you won't want to do that if you have anything stored on it.I will just have to see how it goes.Wish Amazon Instant Video would play on it, but RedBox now offers an $8 monthly subscription rate for 4 dvds at the kiosk and unlimited streaming.That along with NetFlix give me two options for streaming video.",3.0,Dead in the water!,1388016000,"12 26, 2013",Electronics,0.0

Now that it is being offered at new prices ($150-180) and has been upgraded to support Google Play Android apps as well as B&N; content, the value proposition is much improved.  (Yes, you will have to be patient and let your Nook HD+ do a couple a major software updates before you can really settle down and enjoy your new toy!  But it's worth the wait.)If you are coming from other Nook devices, you'll feel right at home.  If not, you may be surprised to find the combined ""reader"" and ""Android tablet"" interface pretty nice.  It's well thought out and for the most part works very well.  Take your time and be willing to explore a bit and you'll soon get the hang if  it.  Don't miss the ""Nook Today"" icon which is a clever one, but easily overlooked.  All in all, I was very comfortable with it in a short time and actually find the UI a bit of a refreshing change.  (Occasionally, you have to use the home key instead of just ""back"" but a minor quibble.) [Note: You can ""override"" the Nook UI and install other ""launchers"" but I, personally, felt no need to do so.  But nice to know the option is there if ever needed.]The size is a nice compromise between the smaller units (too small for comfortable long video watching) and the larger units (big, heavy, bulky).  The 8-9"" range seems to be the sweet spot.  The FULL HD (1920x1080 256ppi) screen is gorgeous with great colors and contrast and sufficient brightness.  Videos/movies, YouTube, Photos, Graphics, all look great.  The high quality screen is the big draw here, in my opinion.  Excellent value at the new price point.The size, weight (very light for this size device), slimness, and easy handling are all good points of this tablet.  Some do not like the Nook hole on the bottom left, but I am fine with it.  It gives a bit of orientation, an easy place to grab the tablet, and so on.  The styling looks good to me and the slimness is nice and makes it easy to hold and handle.HD YouTube and Netflix look wonderful.  This is absolutely one of the best tablets for the price if you want to watch Netflix on the go.  I was able to hook up my portable bluetooth speakers without any problems, so the movies sounded great as well.  Bluetooth headphones also worked well as did regular headphones, of course.  The built in speaker(s) is OK, but not sufficient for best music and movie sound quality (as is true with most tablets).The controls are well placed, simple, and easy to use.  The MicroSD card slot is a nice bonus so you can expand your storage easily and is a feature missing from many tablets.  The proprietary charging port is a minus, a standard USB would have been more flexible, but it works well and charges faster.  The handy ""HOME"" button with the Nook logo is very useful and also works well.There are no cameras - and I could care less, but some might.  I'll take the superb screen, great design and build, and other nice features and be happy.  For the techies, it uses 1.5 GHz dual-core OMAP 4470 proc and 1 GB of RAM.  Not cutting edge, but plenty fast.  Benchmarks I checked were all pretty good and the Nook HD+ is very responsive in use. The back features a nice ""soft touch"" feel that I really like versus many tablets that have a slick back making them prone to being easily dropped.The recent update adds the Chrome browser to the NOOK HD+ and web browsing is snappy and works well.  Everything looks great, of course, on the FULL HD screen and the Chrome browser handles most web pages with aplomb, formatting them nicely for the Nook HD+.  Chrome will also sync and update your bookmarks and such across devices, automatically, which is nice.If you like Barnes & Noble and their books and movie content, then, of course, that is a win for you as well.  It's all here and well integrated.  Plus there are some Nook HD+ specific apps pre-installed and you should prefer them in most cases.  (Note: I made the mistake of updating the Nook Netflix app with the one from the Google Play store -- big No-No!  It did not work at all.  Once I uninstalled it and went back and reloaded the Nook-branded version from the Nook store (free) -- everything worked fine again. I've had this issue with other tablets as well, the Netflix app seems to be very picky and you need the right one for your specific tablet. I had also installed the Android Pandora over the Nook version, but that one worked fine.  So...if you do this and have issues, just uninstall and reinstall from Nook Store/Cloud vs. Google Play Store and you'll be fine.)All of the other Android apps from Google Play that I tried have worked fine.  Pandora, Stitcher Internet Radio, Maps, Amazon MP3, Amazon Kindle (wow! a bit of a surprise!), Gmail, YouTube, etc. all work as expected.  The new openness of the NOOK HD+ is a game changer for the NOOK line, and pushes it way up in the rankings in my opinion.I bought mine at the local B&N; store and there's a lot of help available there if you need it, which is a huge bonus if you are tech challenged and need advice and help locally.  Very friendly staff and great customer service, what a novel concept!  ;)The Nook HD+ is a ""sleeper"" - an often overlooked alternative to other more expensive tablets that can both out perform them and well beat them in value, being available currently at very attractive prices.

There's nothing wrong with the Nook. This is a solidly constructed, responsive, quality tablet that is fun - and a joy to use..I've seen economically-priced tablets that are better suited to be used for target practice.I purchased my Nook HD+ 32GB over a year ago, and have never regretted the choice.Loaded with a 64 GB micro SD card, this thing has extraordinary data storage capacity, and withthe advent of Google Play,  Nook is definitely a major player.Keep in mind: any movies purchased from Google Play download only to the Nook's onboard memory; however, movies purchased from Barnes & Noble may be defaulted to load to either the memory card, or the onboard memory.Between purchases made on Google Play and B&N;, there are curently 22 movies downloaded to my Nook. And there's room for at least 22 more.  Ebooks load in either the EPUB or PDF file format.  As a reader, this is as good as it gets.The audio on this thing is amazing, and the video really pops.The Nook sells itself:After I downloaded 'Star Trek: Into Darkness', a  friend watched the first few minutes, and was so blown away, he immediately ran out and purchased an HD+ of his own.After seeing my Nook in action, several friends promptly got their own.Due to an understandable conflict of interest, Amazon video isn't compatable here.Nook owners have to suck it up and settle for Netflix and forget about using Amazon Prime's wonderful video library.And hey:You don't have to be a NASA engineer to use this thing: Complementary tech support is availableat 800-842-2665.Bottom line: This is a wonderful piece of equipment and an unbeatable value.

I realize for those that have come from old hardware or new to tablets might believe this is a bit harsh, but keep in mind this is more of a comparison to other options available out there. Granted there are price differences and for price alone, this is a decent deal.The hardware itself is impressive. Bought these for our 4 and 6 years which were upgrading from their Galaxy 2 7"" tablets. The most significant issue with these tablets is the B&N; version of an already outdated Android OS_Ice Cream Sandwich, not the latest Jelly Bean which is far far better. It is very clunky and very slow, not at all snappy by any sense, even with the latest updates. I did buy it as they finally put Play on it which was a requirement for me, but the OS itself is just horrible. It does have a kids profile mods which is very handy as it allows you to limit what your kids can open.Additionally, as this is an 'overlay' OS, it is very limited in terms of options. Sound options are none existent for various task such as switching profiles, etc. Many apps on the Google store will indicate not compatible with this device. I generally ROM my Android devices however CM10 is the only one at this time with any support and that ROM is very very buggy compared to say Frosty ROM which is not available for this tablet. It works, but again, not a smooth integration of a ROM. So really, your stuck with what B&N; puts on it and at this time, it is very slow and clunky. Now you can 'BUY' a card with Jelly Bean on it, but again, pulling off the card is slower vs. internal memory, though it does allow for a very simple method of getting a 'real' Android OS on this tablet and perhaps the best route at this time.For the kids, they still like the tablet, enjoy the better graphics, larger screen, etc. Once going graphics is good, sound is adequate though not great, touch input is good. But for me, I could never use this tablet for serious use. My Asus TF700T is my go to tablet, even over my iPad 4,3,2,etc. At this time I am contemplating just selling these and buy Nexus tablets for the kids instead as it is more a pure Android experience and not hindered by the clunky implementation of an older Android OS. Perhaps if B&N; releases an OS based on Jelly Bean it may improve things.Bottom line, there are far better options in the Android world.PROSGood resolutionTouch is goodGreat balance of size, not large nor small like a 7"" tabletHas Play installedExternal memory card optionCONSB&N; OS is horrible, slow, cluncky, and based on old Ice Cream Sandwich, not Jelly BeanSpeakers are just OKVery limited accessory options compared to even Kindle HD devicesCharger plug is very tight on both of my models.

Easily my favorite looking tablet cosmetically. After booting it up and installing the updates for Google Play and so on I was up and running. The screen resolution and quality was really gorgeous, more pixel resolution than most, a great value considering how cheap this tablet now is! The dual core processor was noticeably a little slow, not nearly a s fluid as the Nexus 7 I now have with it's quad core processor. People who say that quad core is only necessary for gaming are mistaken, it effects everything, such as waiting time between opening and closing apps, returning to the home screen, loading web pages, even how fluid you can navigate from page to page of your apps.At $150-180 this is still a great value even with a slower processor and the exclusion of the Amazon App store (which is home to the majority of my already purchased apps) The real shame it the heating issue.Within a week I returned my first Nook because it kept overheating and force shutting down. I returned it for a new one in hopes that it was a fluke, but two days later had the same overheating issues. The XDA Developer forums seem to agree that many Nook HD + tablets have heating issues due to it's microprocessor in the lower left side of the device...exactly where mine would heat up before shutting itself down.This was obviously a pretty huge design flaw. I tried two different tablets and both were force shutting down just about every other day due to regular use....not playing graphics heavy games.

The display sports a very good picture--one of the best I have seen--and the OS is pretty smooth with only some occasional lag, which might be an issue with certain apps.  When I opened my Nook and fired it up, Google Play had not been installed.  After a quick software update, Play appeared which allows me to download a great deal of Android apps onto this device.  I have since added all the apps which I consider to be essential, for me, and all of them work nicely.  As for the feel/design, it's nice.  The tablet isn't too heavy or too light, and all the buttons are placed nicely for ease of access.  Even better, this unit has a micro SD slot to expand memory.  The only thing missing from the last tablet I had, that I can tell, is the camera--and honestly, I don't care about that.  Cameras typically aren't that great on tablets anyway.My only issue with this tablet is the feel of the screen.  While it has one of the best pictures of any tablet I have seen, the way the screen feels when you slide your finger across it is, well, just not a smooth feel.  The screen picks up fingerprints very easily as well.  As of now, I have a Nook matte screen protector on mine, which makes it feel more like a GPS screen, but I imagine once I add a high quality glossy protector, this issue will be resolved.Bottom line:  if you're looking for an affordable tablet for reading and downloading Android apps, give this one a try.

I honestly cannot see a big difference betweenthe several built-in fonts. I cannot guess at the Nook Glowlights durability after one week.To be fair...I think this device would be very competitive in a world of many ebook choices and offerings. However after some little experience I have some concerns.My first inclination after receiving this as a gift was to find a cover to protect it and the screen. The Barnes and Noble store had some covers, but even the salesperson was not able to recommend them with a straight face. So far the online offerings are slim to none. Hope someone solves it. A well designed cover would enhance this product greatly.I discovered that it is difficult to turn on in the dark. Seems pretty basic, and can be accomplished, although not gracefully. I may have missed something in the directions on this.The reader has many books available for a cost, of course, and for free. Finding the free books is more difficult than the priced ones, but doable. However, I am concerned that of the few books I have wanted to buy via the Nook, in comparison with the Kindle ebooks, those books that I have looked up have been substantially more expensive via the Nook.

If you add a blank tile or two it takes a few seconds longer, but it will find all anagrams of 7 tiles within a few seconds.3. Battery life seems extremely good.4. The word games are fun and have three levels of challenge.5. Purists would look down on using this for anagramming. I can understand that.

It's a defective product; either poor materials, bad construction, or bad engineering.Where the cord plugs into the Nook itself; that's where the problem is.  If it gets even the slightest pressure put on it the it starts coming apart.  Then you start loosing connection; typically the power connection.  You end up fiddling with it trying to get JUST the right position so it will actually charge.We've had two now do the exact same thing.  Go look online for Nook charging problems and you'll see lots of other people with the same problem.  There's even a couple reviews here with the same problem.Buying our third one now!  Cheapest I could find them was $20... TWENTY DOLLARS for something I KNOW is going to break!  This is completely outrageous.  We are NOT buying another BN brand piece of junk ""power kit"".If you want you can call up support for the device, complain about it, and they will send you another one for free.  Takes 2-3 weeks for it.  OK cool so I get one for free.... but my battery wont last 2 weeks and it will be the same defective product that will last me a couple months.I'm just going to go buy some cheap Chinese knock off for 1/3 the price.

I simply place them in a drawer when not in use. But after 10 or so times installing the cable to the adapter the casing falls apart.This cable charges very well when used for the Nook Color which I must say is a plus after trying out various other cables. The downside is, after buying these cables to replace the broken one, you might want to consider getting a different device altogether. The price of the cable is pretty steep and replacement costs start to add up quickly. Great product when it works.

(2) The magnetic tab on the right side can be stowed out-of-the-way by two methods...either bend it 180-degrees backwards and it will attach magnetically to the back cover or tuck it into the 1/4"" space between the Nook unit and inside of the back cover.

If it died I'd buy another one.Original review:There is another product on Amazon.com that looks just like this and is about $10 more. I found this one and purchased it. I think they are the same product.As for the product itself I think it is great. The sound won't knock your socks off but it is clear and loud enough for outside use as long as the neighborhood isn't too noisy.One thing I was glad to learn was I could control the volume from my iPod Touch or from the speaker. The final volume is a combination of both volume controls. I was not sure from reading the advertisements if I could still use my iPod to control the volume.I had another portable, rechargeable speaker but it has to be connected to the iPod with a short 3.5mm cable. That speaker works great but has two problems for me. First if I left the speaker and iPod sitting somewhere while I worked in the yard I would have to walk to it to change tracks, pause it, or adjust the volume. Second I'd have to pick up both the iPod and the speaker to make any adjustments which is a bit awkward.This little Bluetooth speaker, just 2"" x 2 1/2"" when collapsed, removes the need for the speaker and iPod to be connected. This means I can either leave the iPod somewhere and move the speaker around with me, or leave the speaker and keep the iPod in my pocket. In either case I have control over volume, pause, play, and next track. Cool.It was easy to pair the first time. Now whenever I turn the iPod on, and the speaker on, they will automatically pair and the sound will play through the speaker. If I turn the speaker off the sound will automatically switch back to the iPod's internal speaker.I tried walking more than 30' away from the iPod while holding the speaker and I'd guess it worked for close to 30' with two walls in-between the iPod and speaker.My only complaint is the USB cord has a proprietary connector on the end that plugs into the speaker. I don't know why manufacturers do this (Apple). I have lots of standard USB cords in the house but now I have yet one more ""special"" one just for this speaker.If you look through the pictures at the top of the Amazon.com page you'll see some show the top as a dull silver with a thin silver line down the side. Other pictures show the top being shiny like chrome. The one I received is shiny.It would be easy to give this less than 5 stars but at this low price I still think it is a good value and worth 5 start.",5.0,Nice little Bluetooth speaker for the price,1351468800,"10 29, 2012",Electronics,1.0

Cotter ""wmcot55""","[1, 2]","Our family has had 5 of these booklights now in various colors (the last 2 were replacements fro broken ones) and all but 1 has broken (so far!)  Two were received broken in the mail since they were shipped in a flimsy padded envelope. We complained to Gold Crest and the sent two more out in a shipping box.  One of those broke the first night it was used.  These are not being used by careless kids (our youngest daughter is 21.)  The problem is that the hinge or pivot just below the light source is VERY weak and cracks easily. One of our two ""replacements"" was received cracked in this area and fell apart when my wife went to position it to read her book.  If you purchase these lights be sure to purchase some Gorilla Glue as you will find yourself gluing the light into place sooner or later.The light output is fine, the size is nice and the clip is very convenient.

Seriously, it's almost eerie.But then it is also highly portable, has great battery life (haven't changed the suckers yet), and does its job with no fuss, muss or swanky doodads involved.It's like the size of a slim-line flip-phone.Or a flat pack of that fancy gum we all chew.How could you not want that convenience?Seriously.Just buy the darned thing already.",4.0,a wonderful little gizmo.,1241568000,"05 6, 2009",Electronics,1.0

Make sure to note the orientation of the HD as it will only work one way...easy to put the replacement HD in ""backwards"".  Replace with the new HD.  The only trouble I had was the cable would not stay in the HD for some reason.  I had to use a piece of tape to secure the cable to the HD so it wouldn't come out.  Next, using a small pair of needle-nose pliers, grip the small ribbon cable gently, and push it back into it's slot.  Finally, carefully hold the HD in place and re-attach the two ipod pieces.Now you will have to restore to factory settings.

The USB is hidden on the back, it slides out which I knew would be somewhat problematic before I even got to the computer. I found that it was easiest to hold my finger underneath to prevent the USB from sliding back because it doesn't stay in place perfectly without a little help.

After each of 3 charging sessions lasting 8 - 12 hours the charge lasted less than 4 hours. Within seconds after the device was disconnected from the charger, the charge level indicator dropped from 100 to 75%. The battery I received is certainly a dudd. Take a chance -- if you like, maybe your luck will be better.Update: 12/6/2013:  Alright, I was annoyed with my purchase and thought I had made a poor choice.  I then tried to charge the battery using a charger with higher current USB capacity (1.5A.) After this the battery lasted a full 14 hours in my GPS while paddling between islands in the 10000 Island National Park. It is possible that current limiting circuitry in lower power chargers shut them down so that the battery never gets a charge if using a charger without adequate horsepower.  Try a charger designed for the CR-V3 Li rechargeable or a high current USB power supply before you decide to toss out the battery.New Update 5-21-2014. The battery has been used maybe 2 or 3 times a month, with full recharge before and after usage but now the battery is lasting only about 2 to 2.5 hours at best.

I do not have one adapter that comes close to the build quality of this. It is a hard thick plastic . Neither end is going to loosen up. The only way I can imagine this breaking is if you deliberately hit it with a hammer.As you can see, it is blue, like really blue. It won't be easy to lose. I would have preferred black, as you can easily tell that it is USB 3.0 by the blue in each end. I believe one of the 3.0 standards is a tighter connection. I found this to be true, as it takes a firm push to connect 2- 3.0 devices together, and an equal amount of strength to take them apart. I consider this a big plus, as you will always be assured of a positive connection, even if you don't have 3.0 devices. I think that one of the USB standards should also have been gold plating. This is a very high quality adapter, at a very inexpensive price. 5 stars for this product, knocked down to 4 for the misrepresentation of the product. For the quality, I recommend it with no reservations.***There is a problem with the photo that is shown at the top. As there is nothing in the description as to the orientation when it is plugged in. The very clear photo is the only thing you have to go by. And there is no doubt from the photo that this will point up when plugged in. However, I ordered 2 from different sellers, and both were opposite from the pictured one. I asked one vendor if they would send me the one pictured, as obviously, it does exist. They said it wasn't possible to send me the one pictured. What?? They did both refund in full. I posted 2 photos, one of the amazon photo and one of what I got. Please comment if anyone had the same situation, or not.

Some of the songs aren't quite outstanding but nothing is below ""okay"".

Whitaker as Tom, who I grew up watching in Family Affair and Sigmund & the Seamonsters (where's the complete series release of Sigmund anyway?!), shows some talent for this material and Jeff East as Huck is about perfect.  I'm always left with a good feeling as the credit roll and happy I picked up this DVD to replace a lacking VHS I recorded.With that said, this DVD is mediocre and in need some a new release.  This film represents kid's musicals of the time, along with Oliver!, etc, and should get more respect than MGM has done here.  That's not to say the VHS is better, not by a long shot.

The movie does an impressive job of creating a dramatic shape out of Twain's material.  The book is a collection of episodes which form a composite portrait of Tom's character, and, for adult readers, offer a glimpse into a lost world; but there really is no narrative drive.  The murder and Tom's subsequent dilemma about testifying in court are simply two episodes unconnected to the other events.  In the book, the boys simply decide one day to form a gang of robbers and go live on the island.  In the movie, the retreat to the island arises out of the boys' fear after having witnessed the murder, and it is only the guilt they feel while spying on their own funeral that makes them return home.  The songs are not especially memorable, but harmless enough.  The performances by the supporting adult cast are strong, particularly that of Celeste Holm as Aunt Polly.  A splendid scene at the dinner table is a masterful fleshing-out of Twain's prose.

This is a far cry from beautiful,  intelligent Celeste Holm's portrayal of Polly - and the family's poverty,  clearly seen in the book, disappears, as the Sawyers occupy a beautiful  home and are close friends with wealthy Widow Douglas.Some of the plot  is distorted in ways that remove the charm of the original. Tom's taking  off to &quot;play pirates&quot; after Becky jilts him is changed into a  troubled kid's escape after Aunt Polly tells him how &quot;no good&quot;  his father was - the humour, and the engaging portrayal of adolescent  &quot;first love&quot; is gone. The theme of Tom's learning responsibility  is overworked, and sequences that are hilarious in the book (Sunday school,  classroom, etc) are largely left out. The enchanting Becky Thatcher is  reduced to a tomboy. And isn't much of the picnic sequence ruined when a  gathering of kids is changed to a song-and-dance outing for families? (Tom  Sawyer is quite realistic in its setting forth that kids are far more  concerned with themselves than fretting about parents - let's not turn it  into a commentary on &quot;family values&quot; a la 1990s political  correctness.)Johnny Whitaker's singing voice has all the appeal of  chalk squeaking on a blackboard.

This is a great family film.

That transfer was great for the limited medium of the laserdisc.  It did include the original overture, and ""exit music.  It was also presented in the wide screen format.  With the DVD format able to present programs with many different formats, why MGM pulled this transfer for release on dvd boggles the mind.  I attempted to write emails to MGM home video to express my feelings about this release, however, no reply.As a film, it is top notch entertainment.  Filmed on location on the Mighty Mississippi River, I give the film 4 stars.  This poor transfer is what is rated here.  The film makers deserve much better, Especially Don Taylor and the cinematographer Frank Stanley.  The Laserdisc transfer did have the film's audio remixed into stereo, as well as updated color restoration.  It would be great to see this film transferred into wide screen, and ""re-mastered"" for the new dvd formats available.

After all, it had music by the Sherman Brothers (best known for their work in Mary Poppins).  And I love a good musical.The book stays very true to the novel.  Tom Sawyer (Johnny Whitaker) is a young boy growing up in 1840's Hannibal, Missouri.  An orphan, he's being raised by his Aunt Polly (Celeste Holm).  And he is quite the handful.  He regularly plays hooky to fish and swim with best pal Huckleberry Finn (Jeff East).  He constantly lies to get out of trouble, too.Through this movie, we watch as Tom struggles with his conscience after witnessing a murder in the cemetery.  He tricks the boys in town to white washing the fence for him.  And he develops a crush on new girl Becky Thatcher (a young Jodie Foster).  But will Injun Joe (Kunu Hank) get his sworn revenge on the boy?This movie is extremely faithful to the book, hitting all the highlights of the classic.  Frankly, that was a problem for me since it took a little while to get going.  Once I got into the story, I was hooked and really began to enjoy the tale.  The scenery and costumes recreate the times well.  And the acting was pretty good.Unfortunately, I found the songs disappointing.  They weren't bad, but they weren't good either.  They aren't especially memorable or singable, and they don't really advance the story.  I would rather rewatch this movie for the characters and adventures then the songs.Despite that rather major flaw for a musical, I must admit to enjoying it.  It has a sweetness and innocence that I enjoyed.  And the songs are easy to overlook since they aren't a major part of the movie.

He lives with his frustrated Aunt Polly and her children, goody-goody Sid, who has it in for Tom, and lovely Mary, who is Tom's only supporter when he gets himself into trouble. Tom's best friend is Huckleberry Finn, an outsider who lives off the land and water and has no one to look after him. The two boys love to fish, go swimming, play pirates on the river, and hang out with their pal, Muff Potter, the friendly town drunk. The days pass pretty much regularly like that for Tom, Huck, and their friends. That is, until two people shake up their world. One is a sweet little girl named Becky Thatcher, the daughter of the new judge in town. When Tom meets Becky, it's love at first sight. Unfortunately, the other disruption in the lives of Tom and Huck is not quite as benign. The menacing figure known as Injun Joe makes more than a little trouble for the boys when they witness him murdering the town doctor one night in the graveyard and putting the blame on poor Muff Potter! It suddenly becomes Tom's difficult decision of whether or not to break his pact of secrecy with Huck and save their innocent, drunken friend from the gallows!If you are a fan of Mark Twain's delightful tales of boyhood adventure, AND if you love a good family musical, look no further than 1973's ""Tom Sawyer."" From MGM Studios and featuring the wonderful music of Disney faves the Sherman Brothers (conducted by John Williams!), ""Tom Sawyer"" is a treat for anyone with a sense of adventure and mischievous fun! Being a huge fan of Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn movies, I have wanted to see this one for years. I had vague memories of seeing parts of it on the Disney Channel as a kid, and I finally picked it up on DVD at my local retailer for under 5 dollars. True, the DVD is in full screen, and it's also true that it cruelly teases us by presenting the trailer (the only extra feature) and film credits in widescreen(and this movie screams widescreen!), but for a price like that, it's worth picking up until a definitive edition comes along! The songs are fantastic! Naturally, it's the Sherman brothers! They do a wonderful job of capturing the feelings and situations of Mark Twain's classic characters! They're catchy too! You'll be singing them in your head long after the movie is over! The performances are top notch as well! Johnny Whitaker is exactly what I would think a young Mark Twain might have looked like, and he's perfect for the role of Tom, full of energy, scheming, and stretchers. Jeff East is wonderful as Huckleberry. Now, I'm dying to see him reprise the role in the sequel that came out a year later! Of course, everyone loves little Jodie Foster, here taking on the important role of Becky Thatcher. Celeste Holm and the rest of the cast are terrific too, but I'm going to name Warren Oates as my favorite in the lovable role of Muff Potter and with the highly enjoyable song ""Man's Gotta Be (What He's Born To Be)."" Of course, the story stays mostly true to what we've seen before on the screen, but the outstanding job done here in adapting ""Tom Sawyer"" into a musical version takes it to a whole new level! Perhaps the 1938 David O. Selznick version is still the best straight interpretation of the story (and I admit that Disney's 1995 teenie-bopper version, ""Tom and Huck,"" is a guilty pleasure, but I LOVE Rachael Leigh Cook) , but if you're looking for something with a little extra ""oomph,"" try out 1973's musical masterpiece, ""Tom Sawyer.""",5.0,A Glorious Experience!,1150416000,"06 16, 2006",Electronics,1.0

I am giving the DVD 3 stars only so that others who have never seen it will realize that the movie itself is wonderful - 4 or 5 stars.,3.0,Shame on MGM - Waste of Panavision,1123545600,"08 9, 2005",Electronics,0.0

I was shocked to see my widescreen smile go to a fullscreen frown in minutes. I then read the back of the box and realized the error of MGM's ways. Had I took the time to read this in the store I doubt I would have bought it, though in hindsight who knows when another issue will be made, I'll likely ditch this and get that when it does. The best part about this release (and most important) is the sound anyway, and WOW they squeeze a lot of mileage out of Stereo Surround! I then rechecked the box to see if this was 5.1 and it wasn't but man oh man you'd never guess it twasn't! The picture is grainy on certain shots, others it is clear and bright, and it bothers me there ain't a whisker of an extra, but I guess that's for the ""special edition"". 2/5On with the show!I really like this movie and always have. Being brought up on it I guess it's almost forced, almost like a religion, but watching this as an adult you certainly appreciate different things about the movie. I see Aunt Polly is VITAL to this movie, her lone performance raises this to another level. Celeste Holm was superbly cast! Johnny Whitaker in my mind IS Tom Sawyer however during casting I am surprised more thought wasn't put into casting a Tom that could, umm, you know, sing a note:) Jeff East as Huck has always been solid and Warren Oates as Muff Potter still shines. Watching this as full-grow'd man I do have regrets that more footage wasn't shot between the glorious Jody Foster's Becky and Johnny's Tom. That chemistry is almost scary considering it's comin' from young'ns. And who could forget the PC incorrect staggerin', ""Injun Joe?!"" He haunted us all but now we just sit back and laugh... gulp, I didn't mean to say that JOE!! No, he's still got that terror filled look. 4/5While the songs can be a tad abrupt sometimes sprouting from dialogue they are generally fun and the melodies are almost always memorable. The theme song alone has been with me for many years. Overall, money comes and goes and while I would have liked to put mine towards a better edition, I doubt I could have put it towards a better Tom Sawyer, and yeah know, at this place in time that's all that really counts.",3.0,It's the most won-der-ful time... in your life!,1156291200,"08 23, 2006",Electronics,0.0

The back of it has a cute cut-out pattern that was something like flowers or hearts... I don't quite remember because I gave it as a gift to my little cousin, but I remember being surprised and impressed that the extra work was put into it.The ear and bow portion pull out so you don't have to take the necklace off to insert it in your computer, like some of their other flash drive necklaces do. The down side of that, however, is that it might be easy to lose. At the party, my cousin loved it and put it on immediately, and then the bow drive portion fell out and was temporarily lost in the yard within the first five minutes. It's probably going to be less of a concern with adult wearers, but something to keep in mind if you're giving it to a child.As a final note, this is not an officially licensed product so when a look-alike is manufactured, something about the original design is changed to try to avoid copyright infringement.

(5-7), so I know what its like really putting it to the test.When I first got this (back in the day), I paid $315 for it. I would only recommend getting this camera brand new as mine has developed some problems over the years (which you can prevent).First off, I didn't know that you should NEVER leave a battery in a camera for long periods of time: it ruins your battery. It does not ruin the camera itself (I called hp tech support and talked it over with them). If you do leave the battery over a long period of time, it will not be able to hold its charge.I would simply get a new battery, if it wasn't for the fact that the screw on the bottom hadn't fallen out (exposing the inside of the camera). This was my fault as I attached it too tightly to the camera stand, and when I tried to unscrew it, the screw was still stuck on, but the camera was off.This is a great camera for someone who wants to take photos every now and then (just remember to take the battery out while not in use). It has a variety of features including action and night vision and you can even further configure the shutter speed manually (through ISO or something like that).You do not have to worry about lifting a flap for a flash or taking a cap off for the lens. It's done for you automatically, and you can configure the flash option.The downside of this camera is that some may consider it bulky. The only thing I really see wrong with it is that it's outdated. If you need parts (like rechargeable batteries, screws, docking stations, etc...) it may be a little hard to find.

The first thing I noticed about the camera was how good the pictures were, and I mean really nice pics.  They were clear and crisp and the colors were fantastic, eat your heart out Kodachrome.  The second thing I noticed was how long the  included rechargeable battery life was.  It was more than a month before I had to charge the battery and that month included my vacation time.  I bought a second battery of course, but that was the boy scout in me, I never had to use it to this day.  It is a bit chunky compared to the models out today, but if you want to take really great pics it's a breeze.  No buttons or menus to fuss with, just set it to automatic. If you like to fine tune there are plenty of features hidden there for the more demanding photographers.  In camera red eye reduction is avialable, as is aperture priority, shutter priority and white balance.  You can also force the flash to fire when the subjects have intense lighting behind them so that you can actually see their faces (flash fill).  In addition there is a ""my settings"" menu option where you can preset all of your desired custom settings for taking pictures.  It also has something missing in most of today's cams, a viewfinder.  Did you ever try to take a picture looking at an LCD screen in bright sunlight?  For [...] bucks this camera is a steal.",5.0,5 Years and Still Going Strong,1242432000,"05 16, 2009",Electronics,1.0

I preordered my KFHD 8.9"" along with the only case that was available at that time (the standing leather case that was $55) back when they first allowed us to.  When the ProCase cover was offered as a preorder in November for a deeply discounted price of $6.99 plus shipping, I ordered that one also.When the standing leather case arrived (a month before the KFHD even shipped!), I took one look at it and decided it was not worth the money.  I mean, really, 55 bucks for a back with a hinged cover and not even padded?  It immediately went back - I ate the freight back and forth but it was worth it.  What a rip off!!  It's the only thing I've purchased from Amazon that I've been dissatisfied with.So, back to the actual review.  This case is awesome!  It fits my KFHD perfectly, there's a flap on the ""bottom"" that Velcro's (tm) in so the Fire doesn't slide out - other cases have an open hole. The Fire goes to sleep when the cover is closed and wakes up upon opening. The cutouts are in the correct places and no port or button is covered.  I can plug in the power cord with the cover closed. The sound is actually better with the Fire in the case. I'm thinking that the sound bounces off the flipped back cover and echos forward to you.  Before I received it I wondered if the sound would be muffled by putting the Fire in a case but it isn't.Also I have to give five stars to the customer service people at Tech Vendor.  They had a problem with their manufacturer and couldn't deliver the case within the month allowed by Amazon so Amazon automatically canceled the order - even though I responded yes to an email stating that the order would be delayed and did I still want to keep it.  The new purchase price for the case is now $19.99 and I sent a letter of concern to Amazon/Tech Vendor asking if the preorder price of $6.99 would still be honored if I reordered.  Tech Vendor responded within a half hour of my email assuring me that they would issue me a credit of the $13 difference upon shipment of my order - and they did!  They were very sorry for the delay by the manufacturer and that they appreciated my business.  I was very impressed with their promptness and their willingness to ""make it right"".",5.0,It was worth the wait!!!,1358640000,"01 20, 2013",Electronics,1.0

I had first gotten this keyboard cover a while back and absolutely loved it. It fit perfectly and protected the keys from dust, etc.  It was definitely easier to type with it on the keyboard, my fingers gripped better.But after a while, it started poking up a little in the middle of the cover, so I ordered a couple more covers from the same seller.The first shipment sent the wrong covers, for different keyboard.  I informed the seller, and he was great -- told me to keep those and sent me a new pair.The new covers fit the keyboard, but the outer edges of the cover are essentially gone - cut almost up against the keys.  Which means that the cover no longer goes down to the keyboard.  Any dust, dirt, etc. will get to the keyboard around the edges.The original, first cover I'd gotten from this seller is like the covers that are pictured.  It has wider outer edges that reach the keyboard and prevents any dust or debris from getting to the keyboard.  These new covers are essentially useless since they no longer protect the keyboard.I'll revise my review if I learn/see that the covers have gone back to the old design that actually does the job.",1.0,Used to be good .... now doesn't protect keyboard,1366761600,"04 24, 2013",Electronics,0.0

My purpose in writing this review is to warn parents purchasing this product for their child or teenager's cell phone that there is very adult material contained on the CD.There are three compressed files of photographs that, when extracted, create general folders then subfolders specifically labeled and containing various types of photos.  The photos range from innocuous cartoons to explicit nude shots, and the nude shots are not all contained in appropriately labeled folders, they're all over the place.I also have questions about where all the content came from and whether or not the manufacturer of this product has the rights to all those images.  As a photographer who posts her work on the Internet, I think about such things.If you're an adult and don't mind having, even temporarily as you extract the files, a collection of adult photos on your computer, then this product does what it claims to do.  It was delivered quickly and in excellent condition, and I have no complaints about its functionality.My rating of 4 is because of having to delete most of the content from the CD after having to extract it all, rather than being able to cherry-pick from a CD and only download what I wanted.

Surprisingly, this case is better designed for a Nook for two reasons:>>The sleep/power button location. On the Nook, the button is on the top center so none of the four corner holds block any button or access port. However, on the Kindle the button - which requires a slide, not a press - is towards the left of the device top and is covered slightly by the top left corner hold. This isn't a deal breaker for me, but I was very surprised at it because its being marketed for the Kindle! So when I want to wake up my Kindle I have to move the corner hold, slide the switch, and then readjust the corner hold. Not easy to do because the hold has a lot of (good) tension.>>5 way directional key. The notebooks that are included with this case slide into the case from the top and still have room to move both left and right. Because of the lining of the case and the thin cover of the notebook, it slides easily but I've never had it come out. I have however had it slide far right inside the cover, and then when I shut the cover it's at such a position that it hits the 5 way directional key and starts to advance chapters! I thought it was just a fluke at first, but then it kept happening. If I do not adjust the position of the notebook or force the Kindle into sleep then the notebook hits the key every time now. The Nook lacks this 5 way directional key entirely, so again - no issues there. (This issue might also be contributed to the ""breaking in"" of the case so that the spine is not rigid anymore and allows the front to move at angles. I don't believe I've been rough with the case though, so I can only assume its common wear).I also want to through my hat into the ring in regards to the less than compact design - though in truth I don't think it could have been any slimmer without causing negative pressure to the devices when closed.",2.0,Design works better with a Nook than a Kindle.,1284595200,"09 16, 2010",Electronics,0.0

That early Kindle came with the strangest cover imaginable, which I never did figure out how to use (you would have to see it to understand what I mean).  It did serve the purpose of protecting the machine, however, when it is thrown into a briefcase or backpack.Since at home I don't use a cover but prefer to hold the unit by itself, I told my wife I didn't need a new one when I gave her the ""hint"" that another Kindle might be a good birthday gift, given the price reduction.  I figured the cover I had would suffice for travel purposes.  But of course the new Kindle is slightly different in size, so I had to purchase a cover after all.  I selected the Moleskine model.The idea of having the reporter-style notebook seemed as though it would come in very handy.  After all, I keep such a pad next to my computer and constantly scribble notes and information on it.  In reality, though, I have used the note pad exactly once, partly because as mentioned, I do not use the cover at home and partly because it does not come with a pen holder of any kind.  You can sort of attach a pen, but it is awkward and not very practical.  The addition of a spandex loop would be a good place to start to improve this product.Beyond that, it is pretty much a face-value matter.  I have had Moleskine note pads before, and you can't quibble with much about them, except maybe the price.  And, as I have indicated, you do need a cover, which purpose the Moleskine performs attractively and functionally enough.  Cheaper covers are available, but this one is a fair value for the price.If you like to jot notes while you read, and if you don't mind keeping a pen separately at hand, then this would be the model for you.

For the most part, it's a really good product, but I wish I could have rated it at 3.5 stars, as they missed the 4-star ""I love it"" mark with a couple glaring design flaws, yet it's better than a 3-star ""meh"".First the good:  Very solid design, much better protection than the Amazon cover.  The Amazon cover always had me fearing I was going to rip out the hook that held the Kindle in at the spine, especially if I opened it wrong (upside down) which, being the dolt I am, I do frequently.  Not a problem here, as the elastic firmly holds the reader in place.  The Moleskine-esque elastic closing band is also nice, providing compact, safe protection for your reader.Now the bad:  Unfortunately, the top left elastic band partially covers the un/lock switch, making it a bit of a fight to get at.  I've got to believe that, over time, that band will fray due to being pushed, scratched, prodded, and probed just to turn on/off the Kindle.  That loss of the convenience I had with the old case dropped my rating from a 5 to a 4 right there.Back to the good:  The addition of the Moleskine notebook is also very nice.  If you're the kind of person who reads books you like to take notes on (or in), this is an incredibly handy feature.  While the Kindle has some notation capability, joysticking around a page to thumb-highlight some text before point-poking a note isn't the best experience possible (though that's not really what the Kindle is designed for).  This may not be exactly the same as marking up a real book, but (with a little practice) it's close enough for jazz.And one last bad:  The thickness of the notebook added to the Kindle body creates a nice sized space inside the cover along the spine (which is a good thing).  Plenty of room to store a pen, and one happens to sit nicely in the space without changing how the case closes.  I say ""sits nicely"" because they neglected to sew any sort of strap, catch, clip, or elastic collar in the space to attach a pen to, and the case design doesn't have ""ends"" preventing what's tucked in at the spine from falling out.  This oversight cost them a 4-star rating.So, overall, it's a solid product. It's not bad, but it could have been perfect and they blew it.  I still like it, I'm still using it, but I hate having to hack/mod things to compensate for design oversights of this kind (perhaps Make magazine's site will have a hack or mod or two on how to overcome these flaws).",3.0,"So close, and yet ...",1282003200,"08 17, 2010",Electronics,0.0

I liked the black external material and the interior color as well. I think that the color scheme of this case is very professional looking.I read different reviews about this case and a lot of comments were stating that there was a lot of issues with the placement of the journal. To many reviewers, this seemed as if it were designed for a left handed Kindle User. Which in many ways is why I decided to purchase this item. I am left handed and the journal placement works out great for me.Having the journal and the Kindle inside of the case does add more bulk to the overall size of the case, however, I do not see that as an issue and it still looks like a great case. I like writing notes down as I write, so I like the idea of having the journal inside of the case, even it if makes is a little bigger.I also like the fact that there is a band that will hold the case shut. Some of the other cases that I have looked at did not have that feature or if it did, the case was not that appealing.There is enough room for a pen to be inside of the case, but there is now place to clip it in so it does not fall out. Also, that is not a big deal either. The fact that there is even enough room for the ability to have a pen is a bonus to the over case's features.I'm not that big of a fan of the elastic slots that hold the Kindle in place, in comparison to some of the other cases that have the clip in attachment along one side of the Kindle. But the elastic holds the Kindle 3 nicely. Since I just purchased the Kindle 3 I was a little hesitant to purchase this case because it is designed for the Kindle 2. Although it says that this case if for the Kindle 2, I read some other reviews saying that this also fits the Kindle 3.I've read that there were some issues with having the elastic strap in slots and the ability to turn the power on/off or the volume up or down. It was weird getting used to at first, but it's not a reason why I would not purchase this case.Overall, I am very pleased with the case and I would recommend it to other buyers.",4.0,Moleskin Case for Kindle3 and Left Handed People,1287532800,"10 20, 2010",Electronics,1.0

It's perfectly usable, but I was always taking it in and out of the pouch.  I wanted something that would protect the Kindle while I was reading.I purchased the Moleskine cover with notepad because I liked the idea of having a place to jot notes.  It arrives beautifully packaged with two notepads.  You have to unwrap the notepads and insert one into the inside front cover.  There are 98 un-lined pages per notepad.  Only a subset of the pages can be easily detached.  The notepads have a black cover and first page is stiff with space to write contact information in case the Kindle is lost.There is even printed text that reads ""As a reward: $___"".  I thought this was interesting; what if I choose not to put in a dollar value?  Would I offend a potential Good Samaritan if I didn't put in a number, or worse, if they felt the number was too low?  In the end, I wrote, ""reward if returned"".The construction of the Moleskine cover is very good, with rigid front and back panels and ample folding space.  You can clip a pen to the spine and not feel like you're squeezing it in.  A pen is not included.When closed, the cover has a quarter-inch elastic band near the right edge that's used to keep the front cover closed.  To my eye it seems a little flimsy, but in practice, it's worked well and has been easy to use.The Kindle itself is held in place by half-inch wide black elastic bands at each corner.  The bands are tight and double-stitched.  I fumbled a little while putting my Kindle under the bands, but once there, it's held securely with no play.It's these bands that cause my only complaint with the Moleskine cover; the on/off sliding switch at the top of the Kindle is partially covered by the top-left elastic band.  I fiddled with the position of the Kindle to put the band to the left of the switch, but it makes finding the left-edge of the switch somewhat harder.It's not a huge problem, but has put a little wrinkle into turning the Kindle on and off.  A similar issue exists with the volume up button on the right.  It isn't as much of a problem as you just have to press down and not slide a switch.  All the other buttons and controls are accessible.Overall, I'm very pleased with my purchase and would recommend it to others.Pros: Attractive styling, excellent construction, good feel without adding significant weight.Cons: Placement of elastic bands at the top left corner can affect how easily the Kindle is turned on/off.  Also, I wish this product was available in other colors, such as brown.Special Note about Left vs. Right handed:  When I wrote this review, there was discussion regarding how the notepad is placed to the left of the Kindle on the inside of the front cover.  Right-handed people wonder how useful that would be.As a left-handed person, I cannot give an opinion on that.  However, I can say that it's not possible to flip the cover around to put the Kindle on the left and the notepad on the right.  While the Kindle could be rotated and mounted that way, the notepad itself is secured by sliding its back cover into a slit near the top of the inside front cover.  The notepad cannot be inserted ""upside down"".The economies of scale make it difficult to market a left-handed version of a product.  The market is 90% right-handed (generally).  Manufacturers have to decide whether or not the cost of producing a variant of the product will be offset by additional sales.  Many times, a left-handed person adapts to the right-handed product.While I suspect right-handed people are not keen to the idea of adapting to something that seems inherently left-handed, that doesn't mean they couldn't adapt and find similar value in it.Looking at how the Moleskine cover is constructed, I think they could change the product so that the notepad could be inserted from either end, thus making it ""flip-able"".

It has a soft ""suede"" interior to protect from scratches and it's firm enough to protect the screen of my Kindle from bumps against the odd corner (and from my keys).The construction is top-notch; the four elastic straps at the corners are very tight and they hold the Kindle securely.  I like the stitching and the suede lining.  The elastic band that keeps the cover closed works fine, and is anchored to the back of the cover from the inside, which makes a really neat appearance.  There is easily enough free room in the spine to carry a pen - so why no pen loop??The straps don't cover any ports; charging/USB cables or headphones can still be connected without removing the reader from the cover.  The straps DO partially cover the ON/OFF switch and the volume control button ( + ), but they don't interfere with normal operation.Possible downside(s):The notepad does make reading a little less pleasant when the cover is open and the left side folded back.  I bought this as a ""protective"" cover, for taking my Kindle to work or to a coffee shop, and I never intended to read it with the cover on (or at least not very often).

They'd included a link to this cover, so I clicked it to see what the deal was.The integrated notepad was a nice touch, it seemed. I'd actually spent the prior few days bemoaning the fact that the Kindle has a keyboard but no simple text app. There are hacks out there sure, but it just seemed silly not having this capacity. Still does, by the way. Anyway, including a nice notepad was one way to resolve this dilemma.And Hoo! It was on the left side. I am left-handed, so I was hooked. Bought it. Boom. It just arrived tonight via FedEx so I sat down to open the package.Remeber, Kindle owners, how much of a presentation opening the Kindle box was? The big reveal, how well put together the presentation was, the little touches? Well it's the same here. Inside the FedEx box was another 6 x 10 box with a black ink band about the middle around the box reminiscent of the Moleskine notebooks themselves. ""Kindle Cover + 2 Volant Notebooks,"" then to the left of that a drawing of the open cover with Kindle and notepad, and below that, ""Limited edition for Amazon Kindle.""Open this, and there is the cover wrapped in black crepe paper bound by a black sticker that says ""Kindle Cover."" Unwrap this, and there is the cover itself with the notepads inside.Lovely presentation.First thing I noticed, the smell. I have an M-Edge cover I've used since January, and it took about a month before the chemical smell went away from that fella. This, however, has a nicer smell to it. Moreover, the smell doesn't permeate your hands like with the M-Edge. The interior is cream-colored, like a chamois. The Kindle is held in by four elastic bands that were a bit of a struggle to get on.The Volant notepads have black covers and off-white pages. Almost too nice to doodle or rough-draft upon. But, this is the purpose of these pads, to be used. Once the pad is slid into the pocket on the left there is room to clip a pen into the pocket. A loop for a pen sewn along the inside spine might be better in the long run.As with the Moleskine notebooks there is an elastic band on the outside meant to hold the cover shut, which is good especially with the notepad flopping around. Yeah, the notepad does not have a rigid back to it so it sags, especially if you have the cover folded over for one-hand use, as I always did with the M-Edge. A workaround I will try is to use the elastic to help keep the notepad in place. We shall see...Overall, my first impression is a very good one. The price is comparable to the Amazon and M-Edge covers, the presentation was lovely, and having a notepad with the Kindle is good if you need to jot down ideas, swatches of interesting text that bomb through your head (this happens to me you see...) or whatever. One of the other Amazon reviews talks about having difficulty finding replacement notepads. That's as may be, and we'll see what happens at that time. I may have to darken the door of a bookstore that carries Moleskines to see what's what, or search online. These notepads are wider than traditional reporter notepads, and are not spiral-bound like all the ones I've had. The lack of a rigid back is disconcerting, though I might just try sliding a piece of cardboard into the pocket in front of the back cover to see how that does.I still give this five stars, even with the very few downsides I see. Short of making something of your own this is a great cover for the money.

So it would only be logical that I would have my kindle cover replaced by this one. This was a no-brainer.I tried it out last week but I was disappointed by the poor design and the untested usability.First: poor design: this cover is really too thick an fat - not only compared to the Moleskine notebook covers but most of all compared to the original Kindle cover. I would have expected an (even) more elegant design as the standard Kindle cover (which is a fine piece of art I now realize). However, what I got instead was a plump, thick and heavy cover that may have the Moleskine imprint but nothing elegant.Second - and this is way I am returning this object: the wrappers that hold the kindle - especially the one in the top left hand corner block the device's on-off button. So you have to fiddle with both hands only to find that the wrapper holds the switch from returning to its original position. As a result my device was reset several times just because of the cover.In short: inelegant and untested .Return to sender... sorry!By the way: unlike all that is being told in the other comments I found the left positioning of the notes not to be a negative thing (unless you would be reading and writing simultaneously, which - as a man - I have no intention of doing).

At first, I didn't even notice that the case and its slim notepad were set up ideally for left-handed users, but what a wonderful surprise!  Lefties almost never get products designed specifically for our convenience; we're expected to use right-handed versions and just make do.

That being said I actually read all the reviews and as it turns out most of the low ratings come from people who don't even own the product! People complaining about the way it looks and one who was even reviewing a different product altogether, and a few who were just complaining that it was for Kindle and not other e-readers or tablets. Seriously people, what the heck?I own one of these and I think it's probably one of the best Kindle cases on the market. The great thing about Moleskines is the presentation and the preciousness of them as well as the excellent quality, and I found the Kindle case to have all these. The cover is the typical material found on other moleskines, but the inside is covered in a wonderful suede-like material. Unlike my last case where the elastic corners covered buttons, the moleskine case has a much better design and none of the buttons are blocked out. I read a lot of reviews from people complaining that the pad is on the left side, but I don't find this to be an issue at all, it is easy to hold and make notes in it. In fact I haven't found a writing position yet that makes it so my arm covers up the kindle. There is also a nice gap between the notebook and kindle where you can keep a pen clipped inside without being forced.I also have to give Amazon and Moleskine props on the packaging. Remember when you got your Kindle and it was in that nice special box, and it was all wrapped up inside. Well the Moleskine case is packaged in a similar way! Something about the added effort there just helps to make it more special.I think it's impossible not to develop feelings for your Kindle, I mean we get sentimental and romantic over our physical books so it's natural that you'd love the mechanical thing that lets you read so many books. I think this Moleskine really just adds to that, it gives the kindle a  natural feel and almost makes it so you don't even acknowledge that the Kindle is a mechanical object. That being said I think the best thing about this case is its appeal to Moleskine fans. If you've never had a Moleskine and are just looking for a good case then by all means this is a great one.

Treadaway ""Member since 1999""","[0, 0]","The Moleskin cover is the best traditional design that I have found to protect the Kindle DX.Protection:1) Oversized for extra of protection.- If a Kindle drops on its edge while in a case that exactly matches its external dimensions then the edge and corner of the Kindle will suffer virtually as much impact as if it were not in any cover at all.If however the case is oversized, as the Moleskin is, then the case will absorb most or all of the impact. I have had this experience which bore out the efficacy of choosing this case.2) Extra strength from the pad of paper.- Despite all of the turmoil about the tablet of paper it is a great way to provide extra protection for the screen, and the Kindle in general.Quibbles:1) The left hand placement of the pad of paperThis orientation is actually logical in order to maintain the access to the control buttons on the right side of the Kindle DX. If the pad had been placed on the right then you would lose the ready access to those buttons.2) Volume control barThe problem with the volume control bar being under the upper right elastic strap is real, but easily fixed. Simply cut a piece of a large paperclip, file the ends, and slide it under the elastic strap. (See a picture in customer provided images) It is a minor adaptation for a fine case.3) Pen holderIf the pad of paper is slid all the way to either side of its slot then a pen with a clip can be held in place with the clip in the slot and the pen barrel next to the pad of paper.",5.0,Best Protection in a Traditional Cover,1298332800,"02 22, 2011",Electronics,1.0

It's a cosmetic issue and I'm pretty anal about the way this case looks.The straps holding the iPad have also lost some elasticity but still hold in the iPad securely with normal, daily use. I've had the case in my backpack and thrown my bag on the floor after a long stressful day, causing the iPad to slip out of one strap. However, it was an easy fix.The spine did make a crackling noise, but mine is broken in to the point where it doesn't make the noise anymore. The downside with that was when i had the case folded in (outer covers touching), a nice angle was made, perfect for typing on a desk. That angle is gone now.I haven't cut a slit to make it possible for me writing with my right hand and might not. With the spine broken in, it's easy to fold the case into a size that's not too much larger than the original ipad's dimensions. I can easily have the iPad in the case on the left side of my desk and a spiral bound notebook on my left with enough space to comfortably write.With the elastic not as strong as it once was, I rated the case lower, but I still love it. But I still wish they would come out with an official moleskine case for the iPad.For the last 2 months, I've been searching for a case for my iPad that doesn't make my new purchase look tacky.  I bought the Incase Book Jacket and didn't like the inside leather trim and returned it the next day. I couldn't wait for Moleskine to release an official iPad cover, so I bought the Moleskine Kindle DX Cover thinking that the iPad would fit due to similar dimensions. While the straps are a tight fit, the iPad does fit inside beautifully and doesn't seem like it will be slipping out anytime soon. The top right strap does cover the power button, but its easy to push down on the elastic strap to get to the button for wake/sleep/power. The volume rocker and orientation lock are in no way covered by the strap as well, allowing for easy access. Apple headphones easily fit behind the top left strap, but headphones with an ""L"" shaped plug would probably fit behind the strap more nicely. The bottom left strap covers just one of the 3 speakers but it in no way hinders the sound quality.The only complaint I have is that every time I open the cover, the pages of the paper notebook fan out, but its a problem that can easily be solved with a rubber band.I'm right-handed and the paper does get in the way, but I may cut a small slit on the opposite side of the notebook holder to be able to turn the case around and make it more comfortable for me to use.Could you DIY a moleskine case for the iPad? Sure. Could you wait for an official Moleskine cover for the iPad? Sure.

Quality you can feel - from the leather hard cover (yet soft to the touch) outside to the suede inside. Well worth the $$.6. Contrary to other reviews, Amazon does sell refill notepads for this case (I always want to jot down tasks or thoughts and find that it works well to have the notebook accessible)7. I'm right handed and I don't actually mind the pad on the left hand side. It forces me to think and jot down something meaningful rather than just copy (my mind is default: lazy so must force it to work)8. No pen loop (bummer) but more than enough room on the spine to clip a pen on the inside and not have it scrape the Kindle9.

When I saw this product, I was excited.  To have a notebook with my Kindle made it easy for me to just toss one thing in my bag and head out without having to look for separate things.  When I ordered it, I knew it was going to be bulky, but didn't think it would be quite this bulky...but it works.  When I opened the box, I was very happy with the look of the product - love the leather - and was excited to use this.  So, why only 3 stars?  Now that I have been using it for a while, there are a couple issues:1.  It is heavier than I thought it would be and I find myself keeping my Kindle out, separate, unless I am taking it someplace.  It was just too heavy to hold and sit on the couch reading.2.  The spine of this product is not well made.  Mine makes crackling noises, like there is a light plastic or something in there.  I thought it would stop after it broke in, but it is still doing it and it is loud.3.  There really needs to be a slot or something on the spine to put a pen.  There is no way to attach a pen - which kinda defeats the purpose of the pairing with a notebook.4.  The spine feels flimsy and when you close the covers, the front cover sags a little and does not line up with the back.  The only way to keep it together is to use the back strap to close the binder.  I expected it to be a little more sturdy than this.5.  Amazon does not sell the refills for it.  Seriously? they don't carry the 5.25x8.25 soft cover reporter notebooks?  I would love to have one with lines, instead of the plain ones - but none of them are available here.

It would have been nice if they had made these so you can switch the location of the Kindle and the pad.

The feel and smell of the leather, combined with the weight of the product makes your Kindle feel like a million bucks.- Security of Device. The basic purpose of a cover is to add protection and keep your product secure. This cover does a great job, using tight elastic bands at each of the four corners to keep your Kindle snugly in place- The Notebook. I love the idea of being able to jot down notes or quotes as the mood strikes. I am right handed, and I know a lot of people have commented on the notebook being cumbersome to use if you are not left handed, but I personally have no problems with this layout. It feel natural. During normal use, the notebook is tucked out of the way-Cons- Admittedly, the notebook can be cumbersome. I use the elastic that is meant to hold the cover shut and wrap it around the notebook when using the Kindle, so that the cover is completely open and the notebook is essentially ""back to back"" with the Kindle. This works fine, but if you dont use the elastic to keep the notebook portion shut, it will be open and flapping around.Overall ImpressionWorth it. Especially good for those who like to take notes, love the Moleskine line of products, or have a secret guilt about giving up those marvelous old leather bound books.",4.0,"Good, but not great",1289606400,"11 13, 2010",Electronics,1.0

Another, in my opinion, tremendous shortcoming is the fact that this cover seems to be designed exclusively for the left-handed use. The notepad holder is non-reversible, forcing it to be on the left side of your Kindle, so you end up hitting it with your elbow while writing. For some reason Moleskine decided that your Kindle in this case will be a side-accessory to their tiny notepad.This case comes with two notepads, however they are only a few dozen pages thick, so you run out pretty fast and eachrefill notepadwill set you back about $10 with shipping.

The fact that I have a 1st gen iPad complicates things further because of the number of covers that aren't made for it. Moleskine is the only name brand that I've found that still is actively making them. I'd been looking for a iPad cove that had a paper pad included with it for a while, but all of them that I'd looked at seemed cheap or overly bulky. Bulky however is the nature of Folio cases that hold paper, and this one is bulkier than my Apple designed tablet cover, but at 1.2&#34; x 8&#34; x 10&#34; it's smaller than my textbooks for school as well as the other paper folio cases that I've looked at. I'm a big fan of the Moleskine brand and am not in the least bit disappointed with the Folio I received. Point in fact, there are only 2 things that kept this from being a 5 star rating for me. 1.) The design doesn't allow for the tablet to be propped at a low angle (for typing), nor does it secure when propping it at a high angle (for watching movies). 2.) The strap in design isn't strong enough to keep the iPad snug in the center of the case, it won't fall out, but it does shift as much as 1/4&#34;. There is a 3rd complaint, but it's only that the reporter's pad that's included isn't a standard paper size, that means that when the time comes to replace it I'll either have to go for smaller paper or order replacements from Moleskine for about $20 for 2.",4.0,"Works as expected, highly satisfied.",1400284800,"05 17, 2014",Electronics,1.0

I was excited; I finally found a stylish case that looks somewhat professional that also has an integrated (albeit old-fashioned) paper notebook. [I also have a Dodocase and a Treegloo case, but of course, neither of them have notebooks attached.] So I had high hopes for this - and when I received it on Wednesday, I wasn't disappointed.The Good:- The quality of the case is exceptional. The leather exterior and the suede interior are very nice.- The iPad slides in and out of the case easily, and is still sturdy enough to ensure that it won't move.- The flap that secures the iPad in the holster seems to very well made, and is designed so it is one piece with the rest of the holder (as opposed to it being sewn on after the fact).- There are slots on notebook side of the case that allows it to be positioned in either the top or the bottom of the flap - this allows you to rotate the notebook around if you're left handed.- The case is a little padded, so it seems like I would do a decent job of protecting the iPad in the event of a drop.- All of the controls for the iPad are easily accessible- The notebook is a great size - not too big, not too small.The not so good:- The case is somewhat thicker than I would have expected. Not terribly so, but just having the notebook beefs it up a tad. I'd say its about a bit more than inch or so.- The binding is more rounded than it is square. This may be a personal preference, but I would like a more squared binding.- If you're left handed (I'm not) they instruct you to flip the case over so the notepad is on the other side. Unfortunately for lefties, this makes the iPad's home button on the top of the case,which may be weird.- The interior lining is a very light tan, so it may get dirty relatively easily.- The binding doesn't really seemed to be rigid at first, so it takes some finagling to get it closed so the top and bottom of the cover match up. I have a feeling this may improve as the casegets used more and the binding stars to develop some memory.- I have no idea how much a replacement notebook will cost for this thing, but like all Moleskine products, I imagine it will be relatively expensive. I suppose that should be expected, though.All in all, I'm very happy with the case. The fit, finish and overall feeling that it gives makes it a great option for those that are considering it for professional purposes, or casual use. But if you're left handed, you have to ask yourself if it is too weird having the home button on the top, and if the cost of the replacement notebooks make it worthwhile (rather than just using a Dodocase and a regular Moleskine notebook, for instance).But for me - its a no brainer.

It's just the right size for my iPad with Smart cover and a composition notebook. I'd been carrying both stacked to meetings but was worried about losing my grip.

At first I praised it highly based upon initial expectations., but now that I actually used it for work I'm seeing it may not be the case for me.I've tried a number of cases for the ipad from a travel case to the marware eco-vue to the otterbox. I always wanted one with a notepad built in and was excited to see the Moleskine iPad case. I placed my order on Nov. 7th and after nearly 3 weeks it finally arrived.Initial reactions, I like the case. It was thick and felt pretty solid. I liked the way the case held the iPad and overall the case seemed really well built. Now, I don't have ANY issues with the build quality. The case is built very well. And others have complained about the thickness, well I expected it to be a little thick since it now has a notebook with it. My measurement, it's just at the 1"" mark in terms of thickness.What did I like:-Construction quality, very nicely made.-iPad protection, the iPad is held very securely in the case, big plus.-Love that it has a notebook, unfortunately it's not a standard size which makes this a minus as well.-Looks professional. This is one of the best looking cases I have seen.My issue comes into the issues I found while using the case.First off, the volume and mute switch are on the inside of the case. This means you need to fold open the case if you need to mute or turn the sound down on your ipad. It's a minor inconvenience, but if I'm in a meeting and my calendar app starts shooting alerts it's nice to be able to flip the switch quickly then go through opening the notebook up and having to mute it. Now in most meetings I am actively taking notes but in other meetings I'm just a observer so when I am not taking notes this issue causes more of a distraction.Second, replacement notebooks. I have been searching high and low for replacement notebooks and cannot find any. I found some small jr. legal pads and tried those and yes they work, but they don't sit as securely in the sleeve like the moleskine brand pad is and I think this could cause to ripping or sagging of the fabric. I think you are going to need moleskine brand pads or risk ruining the fabric sleeve. This is just a guess. And since you can't at the current time buy replacement notebooks you are out of luck once you run through the initial 50 pages.Third, no pen loop. They give you a notebook and a spot for your iPad, but nowhere to hook a pen. Yes I can carry a pen in my pocket, but you would think for the cost there would be a small loop to hold a pen or iPad Stylus like the pogosketch.Fourth, the true left-handedness of the case. The case can in fact be used by left handed people, but that causes a few issues. First off the back becomes the cover and now you have an upside down moleskine logo, plus the band is attached to the back so the sleek look is gone. Then my biggest complaint, the iPad is upside down when used in left handed mode so the home button is at the top. This also means the microphone is opposite the home button. So when the home button is at the top the microphone is pointed towards you. I use an app to record audio from meetings and take notes and when the iPad is faced the right direction this works flawlessly. When I use the Moleskine case in left handed mode the microphone faces me and in turn the audio is hard to hear as it is pointed away from the conversations.Fifth, no stand. It would be nice if you could somehow stand the ipad up but this case is really just meant to be used flat on it's back. It's not sold as a case with a stand, but come on, for topping the $60 mark you would think it would have one.All in all, it's  nice to finally have a case, built well with a notepad. But given the lack of replacement notebooks readily for sale for this case and no pen loop to carry a writing instrument makes it weak. I can use the case in right handed mode, but they sell it as left handed compatible and it really isn't as functional as it should be. They instead should release a second model that IS built for left handed and not make one unit semi-reversible.I may end up returning this case and going back to my marware. I'm going to keep using it until the end of this week before deciding..--UPDATE 12/9/2010--I have returned the case back to Amazon and have gone back to theMarware Eco-Vue for iPad. This out of all the cases I have use is the best for my personal situation. I wanted to like the Moleskine case but it just didn't work for me and I still can't find replacement notepads. Sorry Moleskine, perhaps revision 2 will be the one for me, but so far your case didn't meet my expectations.",2.0,"It's an ok case, with some major flaws.",1291075200,"11 30, 2010",Electronics,0.0

I love their products, and when I saw this book light, I thought, ""Hey, I could use a beautiful book light."" I checked the reviews and the many negative comments made me slightly apprehensive, but I figured they were just a handful of negative experiences or competitors trying to discourage me - there was no way that a company that has built itself on the quality of their product would produce something that didn't work correctly...I made the 35 minute trek to the only office supply store that had them in stock, purchased it, went out to my car, opened it, **click** turned it on... **click** **CRUNCH**... **click click**... and that was it. Just like the other reviews, it wouldn't turn off. Crestfallen, I walked back into the store, hoping to exchange it. When I walked up to the cashier, she was not surprised and said that this was the third time she'd had someone come right back in and exchange the light. She gave me another one which I proceeded to open and it worked, but by the time I got home, it was stuck in the on position again. I am going to take it back next week and get my money back.I urge you not to purchase this light. It is poorly made, and if, like me, you were expecting the quality of a Moleskine product in this book light - I am telling you it's just not there. Defects aside, the light does not feel good in your hand. The best products make you want to use them. When I buy a new Moleskine journal, I want to write, even if I have nothing to say. I expected in buying this book light that I'd want to read at night, even if I didn't have anything to read! Perhaps I'm asking for too much from a $20 book light, but it's what Moleskine themselves have taught me to expect from them. I was extremely let down and am hoping they'll take this one back to the drawing board.

It doesn't feel cheap, but it certainly doesn't feel as nice as you'd expect for this price.More disappointing though was the flawed design. The case says it's meant for both right handed and left handed writers, however, fails to mention that it's default is for left handed (notepad on the left, iPad on the right). When you switch the notepad around so it's on the right, the iPad Mini faces down (ie. the wrong direction). It doesn't seem so bad except the camera is then pointed in the wrong direction and the cover as well. Thus you either hold it backwards or open and flip it upside down to be on the proper side.These seems like a trivial problem, but when you're paying for a brand that charges for their design aesthetics, it's a bit disappointing. I mean, what percentage of the population writes predominantly with their left hand? I have no issue with it working for both sides but why not have the default option be created for the 80% of the population or make an option that switches back and forth more eloquently.

This allowed me to get the most cost effective panel for my needs without paying for all the extra internal switching circuitry.  This Yamakasi fit the bill perfectly.

I found out about these Korean imports last fall and have been fidgeting like a kid who has just enough money to buy one toy but can't decide to actually buy because he's not sure if it would be worth his money. When I took the plunge, I decided to pay a tad bit more and get the perfect pixel version. There also was a HDMI/display port/DVI multi-output version that asked slightly more on top of the perfect pixel price, but since my purpose for this monitor is strictly to game using my GTX780, I ordered this version.Arrival: very fast and efficient, especially considering I ordered it during the snow-maggedon of North America few weeks back, and it still arrived in less than a week's time from the moment I clicked purchase to the moment I took my phone out and snapped a celebratory picture in my living room.Quality: No dead pixel, as promised. Screen was much brighter than my 3 year-old Samsung 1080p, but I decided to stick with default setting after playing around using the NVidia desktop because it's a non-glossy screen and I have it positioned in the room where it gets some sunlight during the day. There are some buttons underneath the screen towards the right edge, but only the power button seems to function, but I already knew this would be all I need, per product description page.Design: Very nice. Big. Tempered glass stand which is well secured to the monitor and adds a bit of luxuriousness to it.Performance: I've tried 2560x1600 on the following games so far, and I've been (figuratively) spasming non-stop from the constant eye-gasm: (surprisingly FRAPS kept showing upper 50s or steady 60fps even at this resolution with max settings on most - try different AA settings and filters yourself for proof)(My PC setting - i7 2600, 8GB RAM, GTX780 SC version, Sound Blaster Z)- Assassin's Creed series- Dead Space series- Crysis series (Holy Chimpanzee... so gorgeous)- Metro series (Last Light starts out fine at 60fps but starts to act ... well, haunted, sometimes going down to 17fps, then I just reload the save and keep playing)- Skyrim (RealVision enb with atmospheric preset + over 60 performance heavy game / graphics mods, and still 60fps)- Castlevania Lords of Shadow (this game is beautiful at this resolution)- And some others which I can't rememberToday I'll probably try SweetFx on Borderlands 2 and see how pretty it looks at this resolution. I still have 17 more games to test out.Verdict: I was mentally preparing myself for an eventual mobo purchase so that I could SLI with another GTX780, but that was an amateurish thought as my PC gaming guru friend explained to me. If you have the same setup as mine, GTX780 (not even TI), 2560x1600 gaming will be played at max / ultra (whichever the highest) settings for most games out there. (see my Crysis reference, I meant all three games). SLI may be necessary only if you plan on doing a 4K display.

This is a very good product.  Shipping was also great.  In fact I was surprised how quickly it came.  After getting it out of the box it was a little trouble getting it together but you can figure things out.  Instructions are in Korean but luckily it was easy to assemble and good to know some people that understand the language if I fell into some problems.  The next issue was power.  Just replace the power cord from the brick with the monitor cord I was using and everything was ok.  I bought a new DVI-D cable but one come included.  My graphics card recognized what was plugged up and off to the races.The screen is beautiful.  No dead pixels for me.

Persaud ""Peeps""","[21, 21]","Although I took a chance on this monitor since there weren't any reviews on it at the time I purchased it, I am very pleased with the the delivery, picture and quality of this monitor. The monitor comes well packaged and the ship time was about 3 days from Korea, which I find amazing. The monitor has an external transformer, and the cable that plugs into the wall is Korean, but a US adapter is provided. If you wanted to have a grounded plug, which the adapter lacks, you could easily swap the wall-side power cable with a US-type cable since it is the exact same power cable as what you would find on the back of a computer power supply, which you would likely have somewhere in your junk electronics box.The base of the monitor is actually a thick glass, which I found to be a very nice touch. The monitor swivels left/right, but not up and down, so if you like your monitor to angle up or down, you will be out of luck; I personally find that I do not need a up or down angle adjustment since the size of this monitor and the eye-level I have with it on my desk provides for a great view angle.A DVI-D cable is provided with the monitor to ensure you have the correct cable when attaching this to your video card, although it is pretty short (3 ft.). I ended up using one of my longer cables that I already had. Once connected, I powered up the monitor and it fired up without any problem. After a quick adjustment of my resolution making it 2560 x 1600, I was very pleased with the high resolution, large screen image. The picture was very bright, sharp and vivid. I ordered a monitor with the 'Perfect Pixel' guarantee and I was very pleased to see that there were no defective pixels at all. All non-game applications such as browsers and productivity tools looked very nice with the higher resolution. Games looked absolutely brilliant in the higher resolution; no ghosting noticed at all.I have a second 27&#34; monitor that I will likely replace with another of the 30&#34; Yamakasi monitors in the coming months. I hope this helps those on the fence as to whether to take a chance on a foreign, no-brand-name piece of tech or not. I do not know how the vendor's customer service is, so I do not know how well a RMA action would go for you, so this is one of the areas you would take a chance on with this monitor, although their order processing and shipping were very fast. The only thing I wish was that the screen was larger (36-39&#34;) to take better advantage of the higher resolution, which is not any fault of this particular monitor; I would have ordered one with a larger screen if it was available.

THIS monitor displays at 60 hz (which is fantastic).  To clarify, essentially hz is pretty much how much fps a monitor can display per second.  Now you can have a 4k monitor but if your graphics card is kicking at 1000 fps, your monitor will only support 30 fps of it (its a dumbed down version of it but hz matter, and you want at least 60, if not more3) 4k monitors may require more than 1 connection (aka 2 dvi port connections) to run well.4) 4k is still reaaaaly new.

I also watched a video on youtube about this carry-on.It came today and I haven't used it yet so can't comment on those aspects. The case seems durable, and the laptop sleeve may be handy, though it is quite large -- but I have a 13"" computer. My main complaint is that the bag is quite heavy! It may be true that it is under 8lbs, but I'm not sure -- it feels heavier. I suppose that for perspective, in India, the entire carry-on allowance is 15 lbs, so 8lbs is over halfway there. Anything 7-8lbs should not be advertised as ""lightweight"" as it is very deceiving. Comparing this carry-on to the $30 one I picked up at Kmart (22""), the Kmart one is significantly lighter.I also find the handles to be very tough to use. They are very close to the bag and there is not much space for one's fingers/ hand to grasp the bag.Overall I'm very disappointed, but perhaps that's because I had high expectations based on reviews and especially the advertisement of lightweight. I was at TJ Maxx recently and saw other carry-ons that were only 4.34lbs (nearly half the weight) and similar in size, perhaps a bit smaller.I would not order this product again.",3.0,"Heavier than expected, handles are not comfortable",1320624000,"11 7, 2011",Electronics,0.0

It arrived from South Korea to North America in a short number of days (without needing to pay any additional expedited shipping fee), and it came very well-packaged.The monitor's design has reflective black finishes on the base and front of the bezel, with a tasteful, matte/brushed aluminum/silver band around the outer edges, and matte black finish on the back, which all combine to give it a very attractive look.  I found the list of advertised features, at the top of the right edge of the front bezel is a sticker, which can be easily peeled off to give the monitor an even slightly cleaner look.Where the included stand connects to, and supports the monitor housing, the housing is not very rigid so it bends when the load changes through there more than I'd ideally prefer.  However, it's not a big deal if not frequently moved around or re-adjusted/repositioned, and is sitting on a stable, firm desk.  The monitor housing does also include two different VESA mounting options on the back of the housing (a smaller square configuration and a larger rectangle).  Although the stand does seem to allow some pivoting motion left/right, this isn't very useful as the base can simply be rotated on the desk surface.  Some up/down pivoting would be useful (and is lacking in the built-in stand), as I'd prefer to adjust it facing upwards a bit more.  (This can still be accomplished, however, by propping something under the front two feet of the stand, although perhaps the steel structure in the stand, if first removed, could be bent, to accomplish similar).Regarding picture quality, as far as I can tell it's as good of a panel as can be expected, for its specifications, and likely just as good as any premium name brand monitor with same panel specifications.  It has not a single dead pixel, and seems to have very even backlighting (and haven't noticed any &#34;backlight bleed&#34; whatsoever).  It does have a matte surface, which is good for using it in a bright environment (e.g., a room with the lights on), although some who are very picky about image quality may conclude that white areas may appear somewhat grainier than they could be, as a result of the matte/anti-glare surface.  &#34;IPS glow&#34; is not noticeable or problematic in a lit room, but is noticeable (and may be objectionable) for those using monitors in a completely dark room (especially when viewing dark imagery from angles somewhat off from the center.)Despite this monitor using florescent backlighting, it's only about 3&#34; thick in the middle (and only about 1.5&#34; thick at the sides), and it doesn't seem particularly heavy.  The colors are noticeably nicer (and specifically, a bit more vivid / saturated) than what you see in a typical &#34;white LED&#34; backlit LCD monitor.  I found that the monitor works very well as configured out of the box (after decreasing the brightness a bit).Using the guide at http://www.lagom.nl/lcd-test/ I considered making a few color adjustments using the Intel HD 4000 video card driver adjustments, but the only adjustment I thought was somewhat beneficial was to adjust the &#34;gamma&#34; from 1.0 to 0.9 (which seemed to make it closer to the sRBG color space standard).I was glad to find that the brightness + / - buttons appear to increase and decrease the backlight intensity level (and don't seem to adversely affect the contrast, like some other imported monitors I've seen reviewed do).  The brightness adjustment range is also useful.  I've experienced no problems with the monitor reliably waking up from sleep, or going into power savings mode, as one would hope, whenever requested by the computer.  The monitor operates no warmer than a several-year-old (and proven reliable) Sharp LCD HDTV does.  Basically, there is a bit of warmth you can feel at the top, so there is no cause for alarm there.  When the monitor is &#34;asleep&#34;, neither it (nor the &#34;power brick&#34;) generate any noticeable heat.  Although this monitor when waking up from &#34;cold sleep&#34; seems to take 1-2 minutes to reach a full, steady-state brightness level, the initial brightness level is pretty close initially to the steady state level.  When being turned on/off or waking up/sleeping, it doesn't produce any sort of light flashing or clicking/popping sound (like my Sharp LCD HDTV does).When the monitor is turned on and not asleep, the 24-volt/7-amp rated &#34;power brick&#34; also operates about as warm as a typical (e.g., Dell) laptop power brick does, so it doesn't seem excessively warm.  The cable carrying 24VDC from the &#34;power brick&#34; to the monitor, at only about 3.5 feet long, was definitely shorter than I'd prefer.  This has necessitated placing the power brick up on the desk next to the monitor (I'd otherwise have preferred to tuck the power brick out of sight off the desk, on the floor).  The Amazon seller did include a North American power cable that plugs into the power brick (a very common style computer cable, with the expected NEMA 5-15 style plug) which had a perfectly ample length (likely six feet long).The included Dual-link DVI-D cable works fine to drive the monitor at its native resolution of 2560x1600 without problems, but at only about about 4 feet long, it will probably be shorter than some will hope or expect.The computer I'm using the monitor with is a Dell Latitude E6430s laptop with an integrated Intel HD 4000 graphics card, docked to a Dell &#34;PRO2X&#34; docking station of the newer &#34;USB 3.0&#34; variety.  As I thought might be the case for getting this monitor working on this setup, I did find that I needed an active DisplayPort to Dual-link DVI-D adapter to get the full 2560x1600 resolution working.  (Although plugging directly into the PRO2X's &#34;Dual-link DVI-D looking&#34; receptacle only yielded a 1280x800 pixel resolution, I believe this is an issue with the PRO2X docking station's design, and not with the Yamakasi monitor.  Luckily, the USB-powered DisplayPort to DVI adapter (Dell Bizlink XT625) only cost about $30 used from an online auction site.",5.0,Great monitor,1398384000,"04 25, 2014",Electronics,1.0

I own an HP-mini netbook & the discription said this unit was compatible. It arrived in a reasonable amount of time, although the USPS mailing package had a huge hole ripped though it (postal workers are hard on packages).

I assumed it would just start playing, & for the cd I tested it did. When I put in a dvd it did not play. I got an error message after install that there was a ""compatibility problem"". It directed me to search the 'net for troubleshooting or change my screen resolution. I did both & got nowhere. After tinkering with it for 30 minutes I was about to call it quits & return it.

This was really unfortunate since I love listening to music and am a huge gamer.  When I went online to look for a replacement drive I discovered that internal drives are pretty expensive, at least when your short on cash like me.  Then I went to Amazon and discovered this little external drive that looked good and was still in my price range. I bought it and hopped for the best. Now that I have received it I have to say that as of this moment I am very pleased with it. Some people on here said that the quality and construction aren't that great but I have to disagree.  The drive and case seem very durable and it was incredibly easy to install, just plug it in and it starts working.  I have tried all kinds of CD's in it and all of them work well, although one of my games made it run rather loudly.  I'd have to say that the only con to this drive is the two 2.0 USP cords, if you are running it on a laptop like I am it kinda gets in the way.  When I was looking in to buying this I was a little worried because nobody on the internet said anything about external drives playing computer games, but now I know they can.  If you are looking in to buying a external drive for this purpose don't worry about it not playing games because this little drive did really well, it's just like a internal drive except it's not in the computer.  I have to say I am impressed by the quality of the drive since the price was so low, I am also really happy with how fast it shipped.  I live in MI and it arrived here all the way from CA in only two days.  I haven't tried any DVDs yet so I can't say anything about that, but if I have a problem with the drive I'll by sure to update for future buyers.

While it was flashing orange and clicking, I couldn't even open the door to the drive to take out the disk. I had to use the eject option under my computer to get the thing to open.

Dancer,"[11, 13]","I purchased this player for my 9 year old daughters Acer Aspire One Netbook D255E for her to play DVDs, games and to load Norton 360 on the netbook.  Item arrived quickly in a box combined with other items from Amazon, simply wrapped in one layer of bubble wrap and put in the box.  There were no receipts etc for the shipment, and only a small booklet for installation on older Windows OS systems.  The booklet DID mention that the unit is a CD/DVD burner, but required additional software to do so (I checked on my Acer 5532 laptop after plugging it in and running a diagnostic check, it is only a DVD/CD player).  It also came with a USB driver disc which was unnecessary for my installation, and two USB plugs, one for media and one for power.  Simple to figure out though, just plug in both USB plugs and Windows 7 Starter did the rest.  However, like others with Windows 7 Starter, I had to download VLC Media Player to play DVD's.  No problem there, except for the additional junk that came with the Media player download which I immediately deleted. The CD/DVD player works great now, and sounds especially awesome on earbuds.  I have a Windows anytime upgrade from Starter to full home version ready to install, but I may return it now that I have this DVD/CD Rom working and the free desktop download correction fixed.Cons:  I was let down that so many others purchased the same unit and received a free upgrade to a DVD/CD burner.  That is not a real major setback since this is for a 9 yr olds netbook, but it would have been nice to have as a back up to our other burner.  One for all and all for one I say!Pros:  Easy,  I mean EASY setup.  Also found it nice that you do not need to utilize both USB cables, just plug in the media plug to the USB 2 and that is all required.  Great price considering the seller guaranteed it would work with my Acer One Netbook model.  Free shipping!!!!  Case seems to be sturdy enough, (just don't pick it up and turn it side to side while it is playing).  Region settings available, so it plays most everything.  GREAT DVD picture on both my Acer laptop and the Acer Aspire one netbook, very pleased!Overall,  I would recommend this to anyone needing a DVD/CD rom for the Acer Aspire One Netbook,  provided you do not want a unit for burning CD's and DVD's..UPDATE 01 March 2011:  The more I use this player the more I like it.  The picture on my daughters Acer Aspire one Netbook is sharper than the one on my Acer Laptop with widescreen HD. If you are an Acer Netbook lover, this is the external player for you.  Just a reminder, it is not a DVD/CD burner.Final Update 04-14-2011:  I finally upgraded my daughters Acer One Netbook from Windows starter to Windows 7 and the new OS picked up this player with no external help required for drivers etc.  I also upgraded to 2GB memory, (see my other reviews), which took all of about 4 minutes to accomplish!  My daughter is playing video games and watching DVD movies off this little player like there is no tomorrow!!  I am amazed that this player has performed as it has.  Total thumbs up for quality and performance!!!  I upgraded to 5 stars, simply based on the overall performance and lifespan thus far.  For the price you simply CANNOT go wrong!!!",5.0,Perfect for the Acer Aspire One D255E Netbook!!,1297987200,"02 18, 2011",Electronics,1.0

So far everything works as expected. I use them in a Fenix P3D Premium 100 (Luxeon Rebel LED, 11 - 200 lumens), and a Fenix P1 CE (Cree 7090 XR-E LED - 90 lumens). For me the performance is very acceptable considering how inexpensive the kit was. I get maybe an hour to 1-1/2 hours total runtime depending which brightness levels I'm using. I don't use the lights for more than 10 or 15 minutes at a time anyway so that's plenty of uses between charges for me.A nice plus is you get the car charger adapter included, too. Most kits require you to buy that separately at additional cost. Probably the only thing I would have liked with the kit is some kind of pouch to keep it all together. I made a carrying case out of an old zippered memory card/battery case I had hanging around. It just happens to all fit perfectly but it took an awful lot of finagling to make that happen!UPDATE 11-14-09I just wanted to update this review to say I am still using these cells and they are still working great. I think the runtime has improved after a few charge/recharge cycles (which is what is supposed to happen), so these are lasting even longer in my lights now. I only recharge them maybe every 4 months with occasional use of my lights. Still highly recommended.UPDATE 11-17-2010I guess it's time for my now yearly update on these batteries. They are still all going strong! I still only recharge them about every 4 months but that's because they have a very good charge retention and capacity.Another big surprise involving these batteries occurred over the summer (2010). I keep my Fenix P1 CE light on my keychain. To turn the light on and off you screw and unscrew the head slightly. If you unscrew it all the way the head comes off (that how you replace the battery). I guess the head had loosened in my pocket because one day as I was walking to my car I removed my car keys from my pocket. I stepped on something hard and happened to look down to see what it was. Well, it turned out to be one of these batteries! I had slightly deformed the top of the battery and ripped part of the plastic that makes up the case of the battery. I didn't have anything to lose so I trimmed off the plastic that was torn, and sealed the case up with some super glue. Fortunately, the battery still fit in the flashlight and it worked fine - still had a full charge! I've since charged it twice and it is still working great.

I didnt want to get one at a time to compare so I just bought both. My mini mic cost me $.34 and just under $4 shipping and rapcap was $14.50 and free shipping.I compared both for sound quality and distance at which they pick up sound. Turns out the only difference is the rapcap is white plastic spray painted pretty while the mini mic is either white or black plastic. Also the Rapcap is about .5mm smaller in diameter but same size in length. The caps construction is identical. Both work identical. Everything is the same. The only thing to test is durability but I'm confident it will be the same.So save the money and buy this one over the RapCap. They pick up sound great from a distance if you have it about 10 feet away from an instructor so just plug it in and stand it up near the instructors desk or sit near where he or she talks and youll be fine.
