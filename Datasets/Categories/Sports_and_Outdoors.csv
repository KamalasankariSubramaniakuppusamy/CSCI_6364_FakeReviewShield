JTE is a truly encompassing guide that touches on all factors required for optimal development (e.g., proper coaching/equipment, physical/mental training, nutrition).

As a golf coach and performance consultant, I could not agree more! This book has immediately become an integral part of my work with all junior development players.

I've worked in the golf publishing business for nearly 20 years and have never seen a step-by-step guide that explains how the best junior golfers continue to improve and reach their full potential until Journey to Excellence. It took someone of Henry Brunton's credentials to finally pull all the key information into one resource. Brunton is the Head Coach for the Canadian National Men's Team, he is the only Canadian ever named one of GOLF Magazine's Top 100 Teachers, he is the creator of the teaching curriculum used by the Canadian PGA and near Toronto he runs one of the finest regional junior programs in the world for competitive juniors. A program that has been emulated by instructors all over North America.Journey to Excellence details the intricacies of every major issue that a young competitive golfer will face while trying to become the best they can be. From equipment issues, to finding the right coach, to managing emotions to understanding how to earn a college scholarship, it's all right here in a breezy read filled with anecdotes from the game's best players who have already reached their full potential in the game.Brunton saw the need for providing honest, accurate information to the next generation of competitive golfers and spent two years working on this manuscript. It was a labor of love and it shows in the final work. I've been fortunate to know Henry for nearly 15 years and he is a major force who will lead junior golf in a positive direction for years to come. If you (or your child) enjoy competitive golf, this will be the best small investment you'll ever make on your golfing career.",5.0,A Well-researched Road Map for Competitive Junior Golfers,1252195200,"09 6, 2009",Sports_and_Outdoors,1.0

Brunton, a member of the Canadian PGA since 1984, is a CPGA Master Professional, Canada's National Coach since 1999, a U.S. Kids Golf Top 50 Kids Teacher and a member of the Titleist Performance Institute's Junior Advisory Board. He knows a lot about golf in general and in particular what life is like for young people with aspirations to become collegiate golfers and touring pros.For those young golfers who have fallen in love with game, who dream of being the next Tiger or Annika (and for the parents and coaches who will help them achieve their goals), ""Journey to Excellence"" is a delightfully supportive but also down-to-earth, realistic guide to becoming the best golfers they can be. Sorry kids, you don't get to skip your homework because you need to practice.""In reality, if you let your homework pile up, not only will your school work suffer, but your golf will too, as the stress of poor grades will likely leak into your golf game. Instead, it's much wiser to take the steps necessary to balance the demands of golf and the other realities of your life so that both spheres benefit,"" Brunton writes.But Brunton is clear that the journey begins with the fun of playing golf. ""For some reason, some people--a lot of people-- have fun trying to move that white ball. There are a lot of things about it that make it fun: the company is almost always good--no one is introduced to golf by people they don't like..."" Brunton writes on Page 1. By Page 3, fun and a passion for the game meet up with the hard work and diligence that is needed if a young golfer is to have any chance of becoming one of the 5,500 golfers playing at the NCAA Division 1 level, not to mention join the less than 500 men and women currently playing on the PGA and LPGA tours combined.There are no instructional sections here, no swing tip sequences nor references to any mechanical devices that can straighten a hook or slice. There is a chapter on how to get clubs that fit properly. How to find a coach, maximizing practice sessions to fit a young golfer's age, needs and personality; principles for self management including mental and physical training and nutrition needs; and developing a plan to win are all topics covered in this handbook. The final chapter delves into the pertinent facts about college golf.As I read the book, I paused many times to consider how Brunton's advice applies to my own desires to take my golf game to a higher level. Though specifically designed to meet the needs of young golfers, ""Journey to Excellence's"" comprehensive and wise perspective could benefit golfers of any age.",5.0,Just What Aspiring Tigers and Annikas Need To Know,1253404800,"09 20, 2009",Sports_and_Outdoors,1.0

When I finally put down Journey to Excellence, that was my thought and my feeling--a masterpiece.  Serving as a consultant to both Golf Digest and GOLF Magazine, and numerous national golf federations around the world, I've read my share of golf books--and then some.  But I've never read a golf book like Journey to Excellence.  It is, without question, a unique, fresh and powerful contribution to the golf literature.  The accomplished author, Coach Henry Brunton, uses an engaging, interactive writing style to place in these pages the wisdom of his experience, the collective wisdom of successful players and coaches, and extensive research.  The result is a highly useable guide from start to finish on how to be a successful golfer.  While the target audience is junior golfers, this volume is serviceable reading for golfers at any level, and should be required reading for parents of aspiring golfers.  Moving beyond the traditional topics of swing technique and mental game tips, Brunton offers sound research on one's chance at reaching the top rung on golf's food chain (chap. 2), excellent suggestions on `perfect practice' (chp. 5), and preparation strategies to maximize competitive performance (chp. 8).  Journey to Excellence needs to be in the library of every serious golfer, and is must reading for every parent and player in junior golf.

I'm about a 15 handicap and though I'm pretty good, I always want to get better.  My problem is that I forget how to set up for certain shots and never have the time to go see a pro or review golf books.  This product has really helped my game. It is very well done.  What I like about it is that it has great visuals and advice for all the key shots and a great review section that helps me remember all the critical stuff I need to do to prepare for the golf season.  But its best use is out on the course. There were several times over the summer when I needed a quick tip like hitting out of a fairway bunker and upslope lies, etc. and I quickly referenced the guide and knew exactly what to do.  It definitely helped shave some strokes off my game and gave me a sense of confidence.I since gave away my Golf Genie to a friend of mine who needed some serious help and just bought another one on Amazon for next year's golf season.

I LOVE the game.  Up until this year, though, I was horribly inconsistent at it.  So much so that I was often embarrassed to go out and play in club outings, tournaments, etc.  I would come home so down on myself.  I said I was going to quit so many times.This year things changed.  I was sitting at a party and this guy started boring me about this book he read and how it changed his game.  Yeah, yeah, I thought.  But then I went on to Amazon and looked it up.  $10 bucks.  I figured its got to be worth a try.Unbelievable!This book is so simple.  I have spent $100's or even $1,000's of dollars on golf lessons over the years and NONE of them came even 1/2 way to what this book has done for me (golf pros should be ashamed at themselves!  They make you do these goofy things and they don't focus on the fundamentals).  I read it three times in about a day and a half.  The third time I read it with my club by my side (to try grips, etc.).  The biggest breakthroughs for me were the grip (I had been doing it totally wrong for years) and the pattern of the on-plane arms, shoulders hips backswing to the hips, shoulders arms forward swing.  Again, unbelievable!  I hit it straighter, farther, etc. etc.  It is so much fun!  I feel like I actually know how to play the game!  And when I start to go off kilter a little bit, I go back to Hogan's fundamentals and it all comes back.  It's weird, I have been swinging wrong for so long...that doing it his way feels weird...but I'm coming to just trust it and not think about it...and I have more confidence to swing hard and just let it deliver.",5.0,The best $10 you've ever spent.,1323043200,"12 5, 2011",Sports_and_Outdoors,1.0

Wow! When she does the roll cast with a stick and a string, what a great teaching technique! You will be like ""oh, that's all a roll cast is?! that's so easy you can do it with a stick and a string!"" lol!  What a communicator!!!  I've read lots of books, watched DVDs, watched other fly fishers on the water but this woman will really get the points across to you. The how's and why's. Lots of easy to remember pointers for where your hand, line, leader, fly, ect. should be at any point during the cast, and in any type of cast, and any type of water, so you will recognize where your mistakes are being made! If you're like me, so OCD you are CDO, you're going to feast on Joan's technical, yet simple, teaching style. Totally different from any other fly casting material I've experienced. She explains and demonstrates why the old 10 o'clock to 2 o'clock, keeping your casting arm pinned to the body casting technique just isn't realistic. I'm a petite female and once Joan taught me it was ok to let my arm and rod go up and away from my body wow!, I had so much more power in my cast!  The best point she made for me and what I now realize is the heart of the cast, is the ""power snap"". Once you understand that part of the cast, the rest follows easily. The first few times I got the power snap right it was a major fishing epiphany for me.  It felt so good, I knew it was right!  And you will discover that the ""power snap"" is as easy as ""opening a screen door"". lol! The first time I went out on the water after seeing her video, my casting accuracy and distance improved by at least 50%! I've got all her books now, I devour them like a fly casting pig. ""Joan Wulff's Fly Casting Accuracy"" is fabulous and is my favorite to date. I've fished with spin tackle all my life and its only after getting into fly fishing and reading Joan Wulff that I've really come to appreciate the beauty of the cast.

I have a very simple task; just select a point on a trail, then another point on the same trail, and use the trail as a route.  DeLorme let me do it, once.  Every other time I've tried, it just connects the two points with a straight line on the 2-D map and won't let me change it.  It does still allow me to delete the route, but that isn't much help.There are at least three different ways of creating a route using an existing trail, but all of them do the same thing; a straight line from endpoint to endpoint.  If I add points in between, it just connects them with straight line segments.  Theoretically, I suppose I could enter a large number of points in between and get something that resembles the actual trail length.Sometimes, as if to taunt me, it highlights the trail that I'm trying to get it to use as a route, but won't keep it as the route.  The tutorials and help pages all say that what I'm doing will use the trail as my route.  The software denies that claim.I've gone to the technical support website repeatedly, and the one concrete thing that I've learned is that I might as well watch television instead; it's just as useful and less irritating.  Technical support is a series of articles none of which have anything to do with the topic that I've searched.  If it has the phrase I've entered, it presents the article.  It even ignores anything that I've entered regarding which product I'm actually trying to get information on, and just lists every article, regardless of what product the article is referring to.

He was for several years in Asia studying a variety of spiritual traditions and traveled as a sadhu (holy person), so his teachings have a strong philosophical grounding.* This video is for those who are seeking to deepen their spiritual practice of yoga. If yoga is meerly a way for you to get in shape, David Swenson's Yoga - short forms might serve your purposes better.*Be aware also that this is not a beginner's level video. This video is for people who are already familiar with the primary series and are looking for a guide through the poses. If you've never practiced before, this may still be a good place to start, but it's unlikely that you'll be able to get through the whole tape.*My only criticism is that, because of intense focus on the breathe and the gaze, some aspects of allignment may not be as carefully explored. However, it is my understanding that he is coming out with a new video that will focuss more on alignment.* Richard says, ""This is an exciting time because there is great potential for reframing the internal teachings into a contemporary context. But there is even a greater potential for turning yoga into a farce by stopping our inquiry, thinking we have comprehended things that are subtle and deep, or by feeding our narcissistic obsession with self-promotion.""",5.0,"Graceful, mystical, elliptical, strenuous, delightful",1027468800,"07 24, 2002",Sports_and_Outdoors,1.0

Ashtanga is a difficult, style of yoga. If you are not familiar with it but want to start this style, it is best to take a class, not use a video. (a video can be great for getting an idea of what to expect, but you will not get the correction and instruction that meets your individual needs from a video)2. Each series in Ashtanga(first, second, third, etc) is always the same sequence of poses. It is designed that one masters each pose and then moves on to the next, eventually completing the series. When one masters the first series (and this might take many years) one moves on to the second.3. Three months of yoga, no matter how many days a week you do it still makes you a beginner. One of my instructors has said you are a beginner until you have 10 years of consistent daily practice. Maybe that is a bit of an overstatement...but maybe not. Part of yoga is letting go of ego and being present where you are, wherever that is.So, yes, this is not a video for someone brand new to yoga.

Mr. Freeman is a true metaphysician and has gone way beyond perfecting the Yogic positions, although being a world renown virtuoso at that long ago, he has spent much time on the deeper subtler aspects of the inner realm of Yoga development. This is the part that much of today's current Yoga movement has missed to some extent.

This video is not for entertainment, but for engaging in a challenging and real yoga practice.  I personally am impressed that they have not including many distracting elements which are normally present (music, chattiness, etc.)  Richard focuses on the breathing and will often say ""this is mainly a breathing exercise"" pointing us to the fact that the breath is at the heart of the yoga practice.  He also focuses on holding the mula and uddiyanda bandhas.  One fault I see with this is that while he seems to expect us to be holding and using them throughout the practice, he only reminds us to do so a few times.  Not being well practiced in this myself, I could use more reminders.  Many of the poses are VERY difficult, and if you are well versed in yoga, you will also find many of them familiar.  The complete ashtanga practice is about 1 hr 50 min long.  For myself I purchased his Introduction to Ashtanga for a shorter option which is 76 min long.  Also, this ""introduction"" has a little more instruction, goes a little slower, and has a few more  variations on the poses for those who are just starting out.In the Primary Series, I am also very impressed with Richard's flow through chatarunga, upward dog, and downward dog, then jumping forward to sit between his hands.  This flow is common in ashtanga and other flow forms of yoga based on ashtanga, so that is not new.  But his immense control, and precise setting down of his body is amazing.  I intend not only to practice along with this video, but also to watch it carefully at other times, when I'm not doing yoga, just to study his form and flow.Another focus of his is gazing.  Very often he gives directions of where your eyes should be focused -- on the thumbs, the tip of the nose, the middle of the forehead, the big toe, etc.  I like this.  If he was as attentive to giving instructions on the bandas as he is to gazing, then i would be 110% happy.I have been practicing yoga for about 5 years, but this is the first time I've done formal ashtanga.  I have been doing Shiva Rea's CDs for about 2 years, and she is based in ashtanga, I now see.  But I have not found myself sweating profusely doing this yoga DVD.  While I find many of the poses challenging, and I do sweat, I wouldn't say that this is similar to ""power yoga"" that has become popular.  The poses aren't strung together all that fast.  I am usually breathing so hard that I can't keep my ""breath together"" as he advises, but I have only just started the video two days ago.

As you know I don't have a computer and I don't know how to use it, but as I can see he employs it for a con game to steal from some poor guys that love the sport.""....

Strong words indeed from a then 81 year old retired wrestling legend who Furey claimed was a teacher and mentor.

However, if you're interested in increasing the muscular endurance, flexibility, and cardio-vascular fitness that combat athletes need then this book is a must buy!  I have been using combat conditioning for 2 years and at age 40+ I am in the best shape that I've been in over 20 years.  The program has increased my endurance, shoulder, back and neck strength and flexibility to previous unseen levels for me.  It has also virtually cured me after I had dislocated my right knee!  As has also already been said there really is nothing new here, but Furey was brilliant in combining 3 exercises which target all major muscle groups while simultaneously increasing flexibility.  Yes it's true that the back of the book is filled with about 10 pages of ads, but that doesn't bother me because combat conditioning has literally revolutionized my life and fitness level.  I would especially recommend this book for you if you do wrestling, judo, or mixed martial arts.  Combat conditioning will not give you a bodybuilder's body.  But after doing it for a couple of weeks you'll feel so good, in shape, and self confident that you'll probably want to go to Muscle Beach and kick sand in abodybuilder's face!!",4.0,great book for combat athletes and general fitness,1099180800,"10 31, 2004",Sports_and_Outdoors,1.0

They two have a bodyweight line and put down lifting weights in one set of books and advocate it in others.Still, this is a good book and I do recommend it.

I have only watched the first DVD because it is so loaded with good information and technique that It will keep me busy for months perfecting my form.  This is the most thorough and accurate yoga DVD I have ever seen.  If you just want to casually work your way through a relaxing DVD with soft music and a scenic background then this is not the DVD for you.  If you want to do the poses correctly so you can safely do inversions and still be rock solid I HIGHLY recommend this DVD.  This is everything I wanted in a yoga DVD.  I have bought many and I am always left wanting.  Please remember my review is of the first of the two DVDs, but I imagine the second is just as good.  I am also coming back to yoga after many years of nothing so I guess you could call me an educated beginner????  I learned from books and DVDs so my form needs to be fine tuned and that is where Mathew's teaching style excels.Pro's1.  Everything is explained in crystal clear detail including angles of your feet and hands and how that affects the pose and your progress in the future.2.  Mathew's voice is pleasant to listen to.  I have one DVD that breaks my focus every time the instructor talks.3.  The teachings are methodical and in the perfect order to build strength before moving on to the next pose.4.  Inversions are taught in step by step increments building the balance and strength needed before doing the full inversion.  (I have only seen this done before with 1 or two increments.  His approach is much more thorough.)5.  I like the camera work and the plain background.  It doesn't distract you and the poses are very clear.6.  There is not a lot of fluff.  I am not a big fan of fluff.  If I want to know the history of yoga, I will study that on my own.  I do not want a 10 minute over generalized intro at the beginning of my DVD.7.  Based on my knowledge of yoga, his form seems to be perfect and his movements are so fluid it almost looks fake.  My niece actually thought we were pausing the video at one point.  That's what I aspire to be and some yoga DVD instructors look like they can barely do the pose themselves or the are using improper form which is both unsafe and limiting.Cons1. This isn't really the kind of DVD you can throw in and do as a workout.  There is the Sun Salute section which shows 5 different Sun Salutes from heavily modified to floating and jumping in and out.  I use that to go along with but it's really more of a demonstration.2.  It can be a little dry if you need a more inspirational feel.3.  His perfect form makes me feel like a wobbly fool, seeing as I am soooo out of condition right now.  I could see that as being a deterrent to the very beginner.  I just hold on to the memory I have from 15 years ago when I was the rock solid yoga junkie doing seemingly impossible poses despite my learning only from books and DVDs.  I will get there again.  Don't let that discourage you if you are a beginner.  It is better to learn proper form from the beginning than have to fix it later.4.  I hate when DVDs come in cardboard sleeves.  It guarantees they are going to get scratched before I remember to get a new case for them and then I have to cut the cardboard sleeve and try to find a way to keep it in the case I buy.  It's just an annoyance but it seems to happen a lot more these days.5.  He does this prayer thing at the beginning in another language with a caption in English.  I'm sure it's important to him.  I just find it annoying.I truly feel that the Cons are insignificant in compared to the amazing value in this DVD.  I only include them for the sake of veracity.I hope you find this review helpful.  When I get past the first DVD I will try to remember to update it.",5.0,Proper form and strong poses from a DVD.,1384387200,"11 14, 2013",Sports_and_Outdoors,1.0

It's called Tamara Lackey's Capturing Life Through (Better) Photography.As the title suggests, this set is aimed at helping anyone who owns a camera learn how use it - well - better. Tamara speaks to non-professional audiences for the first time in this series, and the result is a comprehensive guide for anyone looking to use whatever equipment they've got to make the most of everyday snapshots.While many in the Photofocus audience already have a grasp on this material, it will be of keen interest to those who are constantly asked by friends and family about how to get better at photography.The 90-minute DVD is fast-paced, and offers incredible production quality. The product was filmed by Rex Ballard, Director of ABC's Extreme Makeover: Home Edition. So if it looks like you're watching a professionally-produced television show instead of a cheap web-video it's because you are. This DVD contains straightforward tips from Tamara's professional experience, delivered in an energetic, engaging format - with some silliness thrown in as well. The DVD covers lots of ground, but it is a little light on the side of breaking down photography's more technical aspects. That's where the book comes in.The 100-page book dives right in to some of the toughest camera terminology and vocabulary, tackling the ISO/shutter speed/aperture relationship early on, but doing so in a fun and conversational manner. Tamara's take on how to best understand aperture and shutter speed is one of the freshest explanations I've heard.  It then moves on to breaking down the preset shooting modes seen commonly on most point-and-shoot and starter SLR cameras--what they do, and why they work.  The rest of the book is dedicated to applying Tamara's simple tips on five components of good photography--lighting, composition, background, interaction, and optional equipment and accessories--to scenarios like sports games, birthday parties, dinner with friends, or family portraits.  Filled with stunning imagery and a few really fun illustrations, it's a treat to flip through.The Quick Reference Guide is attractively designed and simple to use. This guide condenses the most important points covered in the DVD and book into a small camera bag-sized booklet. Including key point reminders, exposure charts and aperture diagrams, it reminds you of what you need to know in a style that's easy and encouraging.The three products do not depend on each other, but seem to work best as a set. There's also an accompanying iPhone app in the works.For new photographers - highly recommended.",5.0,Highly Recommended,1296345600,"01 30, 2011",Sports_and_Outdoors,1.0

BUT, after purchasing it for my five and half year old, who is way beyond his age when it comes to constructing and building, I understand what others have complained about in the reviews. We purchased it for a Santa present and instead of constructing it for him, we thought it would be great for Daddy and my son to do it together Christmas day. It was a good activity, but it took about three hours for my husband and my son to put together and a few of the parts broke during assembly. Mind you, these two build things together all the time. My five year old can construct snap circuit into models not even listed in manuals on his own. Now that the toy is constructed, it is a lot of fun and my two year old likes it too, but pieces are always falling apart and breaking. Thankfully there are a few extra pieces in the kit. Also, there are a few gears that provide a function in the marble run, but those gears in the front are just for decoration--so a little deceiving. All in all, it's a decent toy, but expect some time to assemble and some frustration, even with parental help.

Many state it took hours to build and doubts as to whether an 8 year old could do it. I have this set plus another from this company in my school age classroom (5-12 years old, before/after school and summer camp). It took 4 of my students working together to build this set about an hour. I only had to step in to break up any arguments. The youngest engineers were 7. There was one 8 year old, and the oldest was 11. It is possible for children to do.As for the educational aspect, it is great for logical thinking and scientific experimentation. Once children start building their own creations, and yes it is possible, they start exploring the science of ""what if"", as in ""what if I move this piece higher"" or ""what if I change this angle"". Of course parents and educators sometimes need to supply the terminology and maybe an idea or two to move things along.Last on the educational theme, paired with other household or classroom objects this becomes a great way to introduce children to Rube Goldberg and making new inventions. Go ahead and Google him, I'll wait.My point with this review is you cannot to sit back and be a spectator with any educational toy. It does require some parent involvement. If children get bored with this amazing toy, then it is the parent or educator's responsibility to step in and encourage new play and experimentation.

Completion makes it sturdy enough to function. Be careful with assembly, as not all support struts go straight down, and pressure can snap a crooked support scheme. When making the example in the book, you may have to move a weight on the bottom shovel from the side to the top to prevent it from blocking the green loading bay trough. I didn't put gears all over the finished coaster, as they wouldn't move. I added a vertical large gear, using a 9, on the bottom. This spins with the help of a medium horizontal gear, which is next to the extra gear coming off the auger assembly. I also added a large gear to mesh with the water wheel using a 10. To that, I added a medium gear using an 11. I put a piece of scotch tape over the sound holes on the Chamber of Sound to make it bearable. We solved the auger loading problem by adding more marbles for weight to push the other marbles in. We use about 30 large smooth marbles all together. This amount prevents bottlenecks and the lower shovel from getting stuck. Having a lot of marbles also means nonstop action.",4.0,It just needs a little tweaking.,1314403200,"08 27, 2011",Sports_and_Outdoors,1.0

Doyle and TJ seem to agree on most points, such as being careful with AA or KK etc. with only a few discrepancies, but they are different players with different styles.

Now this book, independent of the other, was quite useful when I sat at the 1-2 No Limit game at the MGM Grand and also when I played the 2-4 at the Tropicana in their Poker Room.Previous to reading these two books by Cloutier and McEvoy, I had finished three by Sklansky.  I found that by following Sklansky's Small Stakes Hold'em I was playing far too conservatively to win.  The blinds were eating me up and I rarely got any good cards to enter pots with.  The opinions of Cloutier and McEvoy are far more practiceable I believe.What we have here is a weed's eye view of what one should do when playing pot limit and no limit hold'em.  There is some overlap with the other book but both are valuable on their own.  The authors conclude that pot limit requires more skill than limit but that no limit requires the most skill of all.While I was in Vegas, outside of the Rio where the World Series of Poker was being held, I did not see any mention of pot limit games but I've been in them a couple times online and have to state that it's one a most exciting variety of poker.  It can get crazy fast and the book is quite insightful in describing the way in which one should specifically play.The reader is given crystal clear advice on what to do in particular situations and the two authors seem to cover every single contingency that should arise.  I was helped by the plain language and non-condescening prose of these two champions.  I also liked the practice hands that were included.

The down home, folksy style of writing makes it easy and accessible, like a good beginners book.  But some topics that beginners absolutely need to learn, like pot odds and implied odds, are skimmed over and barely touched on.  Other times, they'll simply repeat the same thing over and over again, with different ways of phrasing it.  I get that you need ""iron balls"" to play hold 'em; no need to word it 5 different ways in the span of two pages.The authors also like to make grand pronouncements and hold fast rules, as if they're reading from a stone tablet or something: ""Thou shalt not draw to a flush unless ye have the nut flush draw AND two overcards!""  (This is not a direct quote from the book, but they do mention this ""concept"".)  Nevermind the absurdity of that statement; I just hate it when poker players say things as if they're the gospel truth.  There are going to be times where you should put money into the pot with a non-nut flush draw or even simply two overcards, let alone both of them.  The overall strategy described in this book is uber-tight, to say the least.  The authors are much more concerned with protecting their own chips then they are with taking them from others.  That's not a bad strategy for a beginner to start with, but if that's as far as your poker skills get, you're going to leave a lot of money on the table.This book is not without it's highlights.  The discussion on how to play small pocket pairs is refreshing, albeit only because two dissenting viewpoints are discussed.  T.J. doesn't really like them, while Tom will play any pair.  I mostly agree with Tom, especially if the stacks are deep.  The implied odds you get from hitting a set make pairs a very profitable hand to play, as long as you can get action when you hit it.  If you're at a table full of nits who don't pay off (players like T.J., for example) then you shouldn't waste your money with the small pairs, unless you're simply trying to steal the pot pre-flop (basically playing it like a semi-bluff).Overall, I was very disappointed with this book.  I think the main problem is it's target audience, or lack thereof.  It seems like the authors wrote this with serious poker players in mind, but it reads more like a beginners book.  If I had found this a few years back when I played ATC (any two cards) this would have been exactly what I needed.  Now that I know how to play the good kind of loose, this book does nothing for me.If you're a real tight player, you may find this book comforting.  Everyone else should move along; there's nothing to see here.  If this is ""the bible of poker"", as the back cover claims, then call me an atheist, cause I ain't buying it.",2.0,Disappointing and dated,1186704000,"08 10, 2007",Sports_and_Outdoors,0.0

Keep in mind that what looks like the same game is actually quite different. Low stakes limit holdem is much different than high stakes limit holdem and no limit and pot limit are significantly different than limit holdem. And finally no limit cash is different than no limit tournament play. That said this book is excellent for pot limit and even more so for no limit mid to high buy in tournaments.A quick hint- the use of the word ""Championship"" in the McEvoy and Cloutier titles can and should be completely interchangeable with the word ""tournament"". That is the player these books are written for.Many of the super tight approaches that Cloutier uses to be successful in tournament play are unprofitable in cash game play. Because the average player is so ultra loose, tighter is probably better than looser but again this is geared primarily for tournaments where if you lose your chips you are through for the day.Survival is one of the most important ideas in tournament play but ultra tight in cash games will often get you too little action on your better hands.

If you are unfamiliar with kirtan, it is based on the concept of 'bhakti yoga' - the yoga of devotion. Singing the names of gods or goddesses in a call and response style with hypnotic Indian music in the background, kirtan is believed to bring a deep connection with the divinity within all of us.Jai Uttal's The Art and Practice of Ecstatic Chant delivers the whole mood of kirtan beautifully.  A devotee of kirtan since the age of 19, this talented musician has put together a CD that is melodic, sensuous, intense and truly uplifting.  You cannot help but feel moved when the first note hits your ears.  There is over 2 hours of music in this CD - and never once will you feel bored.  Uttal has a gorgeous voice - you can feel his love of kirtan in every syllable that he utters.There is an introduction in the CD, where Uttal explains kirtan and the path that led him to it.  This is a great piece - I feel that it gives an insight from a true devotee.  The intro helps even those who are new to kirtan to understand the significance and beauty of this ancient and spiritual art.  I recommend this highly to everyone - not just those on the yogic journey.There are a few kirtan 'stars' out there in the US these days - Krishna Das and Ragani to name a few - who are helping a wide audience enjoy and appreciate kirtan.

But for harder hikes I'll definitely buy the actual maps anyways and for easy hikes just use the free maps they hand out to everyone. The information I found on alltrails was generally wrong. I understand this is a mostly a user database and it is people adding the wrong information. When the length of the trail is listed as 1.4 miles and from personal experience and after two seconds of research I find that the trails actually measure over 7 miles according to the official website, it bums me out. Then I look and see that the locations are wrong. One trailhead was supposedly in the middle of a river. I tried adding photos and there were errors for 1/3 of them. I tried correcting trails and some of the information did make it through but not all of it and  I don't feel it's my job to fix things. I tried adding new trails that weren't there and they just disappear. So I can't even make myself a ""accomplishment list"".

Since this 2012 edition pre-dates the latest championship, this edition obviously lacks anything having to do with the 2013 title.One of the hardest things to tell about this before buying it is just what's included. Of the 13 pages pictured on the product's cover (the ones included with this listing), 10 are in the 1975 to 2011 era (just 29 of the 64 pages, 63 pages if you discount the cover). The others (two on Ted Williams plus one from the 1915 Series) don't give a good representation of the majority of the content (the other 35 pages).Arguably, one of the most fun aspects of this is hunting for why some of the earlier pages were included. This treasure hunt reveals gems in Red Sox (and world) history which even a fairly decent fan like myself might not know (the diehards will probably be searching for the articles by date!). If you want to know what you are getting, keep reading. If you want to discover these gems for yourself, then stop reading - ""spoilers"" follow....The entire ""paper"" is split into four sections. The first (20 pages) covers 1904-1920 including a box score mention of Cy Young's perfect game, the first in baseball's ""modern era"" (according to Wikipedia), the first game played at Fenway Park, the 1912 pennant, Snodgrass's muff (which won the Sox the 7-game 1912 Series...in 8 games), and the 1915, 1916, and 1918 championships. Part of what is so wonderful about the articles from this time period is that the Sox's opponents for many of these key games were against New York-based rivals (Yankees, Brooklyn Dodgers). Consequently, these articles were big local news, not just big sports news, and are sandwiched on the Times front page between such monumental world headlines as ""War Declared; Battle Raging in the Balkans"" and ""(Col. Theodore) Roosevelt Gains, Bullet Located, Lodged in Rib."" Part 1, naturally, ends with the 1920 headline, ""Ruth bought by New York Americans for $125,000.""Part 2 (another 20 pages) covers the relatively quiet years from 1939 to 1975, very heavily loaded with Ted Williams highlights (""first big leaguer to bat in 100 runs,"" his All-Star game-winning HR, his 0.4057 batting average, and the change in his draft status from 1A to 3A, the homer that won the 1946 AL pennant, an AL MVP mention, another batting title, his 500th homer, and his final at-bat). It also includes mentions of Jimmy Foxx's 500th career homer and Lefty Grove's 300th victory.Part 2 continues with a 1967 piece on Bill Rohr's rookie debut game - a one-hitter. This page also includes this amusing description of batting gloves: ""When Yankee Stadium opened in 1923....players and spectators then would have been flabbergasted at the idea of batters wearing golf gloves, and Ruth's comments might have been unprintable. Today, it is commonplace equipment, and several players on each team wear them to reduce blisters and other shocks"" which nicely captures the changes in the times (from 1923 to 1967 to present where pretty much everyone wears them) and the Babe's infamously colorful personality in one fell swoop.This is followed by coverage of the 1967 pennant, Yaz's signing, Jim Lonborg's Cy Young victory, and the 1975 pennant.  Part 2 ends and Part 3 (16 pages) begins on a high note, with the Sox tied in Game 6 of the 1975 Series. Part 3 mercifully skips the next few weeks and fast-forwards to Fred Lynn's record setting MVP (first AL rookie to be named MVP). The other highlights in the following grim years for the Sox include Yaz's 3000th hit and retirement, the Rocket's 20-K game, the '86 pennant, and (painfully, for those of us who remember this Series well), coverage of Game 7 vs the Mets. :/ Ugh. `Nuff said.This section continues with coverage of the 1990 Division title, Roger Clemens's third Cy Young, Pedro's 1999 All-Star classic (which includes a photo of Ted Williams, who threw out the first pitch, and includes historically interesting coverage of Pete Rose's presence on the All-Century ballot, and of day one of Lance Armstrong's first Tour de France defense...also noteworth: the caption on Pedro's pic notes that ""his victims included Sammy Sosa and Mark McGwire."" Part 3 thematically ends with Ted Williams' obituary and several long retrospectives on his career and impact, and with the 2003 Division series title (featuring the massive outfield Collision between Johnny Damon and Damian Jackson).The last few pages of Part 3 begin the chronicle of the 2004 journey (stuck in this section, presumably, because the pages need to be grouped in 4s). The story begins with Game 6 of the ALCS  featuring the famed A-Rod pansy slap at Bronson Arroyo, and Curt Schilling's famed bloody sock. The first page of Part 4 (8 pages) features Tek jumping into Alan Embree's arms after the victory over the Yankees and includes another page including articles on the ""Yankee mercenaries"" and the ""Monumental Collapse."" Mark Bellhorn's clanger of Pesky's Pole in the 2004 Series gets a mention and then it skips ahead to the good part where Sox fans can ""Kiss That Curse Goodbye: After 86 Years, Boston Gives the Boot To the Bambino.""The 2007 coverage includes just Schilling's Game 1 victory in the World Seriews, and the subsequent ""Coronation."" The final pages include (oddly) Johnny Damon (as a Yankee)'s first visit to the DL (after over 10 years in the Majors), Wakefield's 2009 All-Star debut after 17 seasons, and last, in what must have seemed like a good idea at the time, an article on Bobby Valentine.I hope if the NYT updates this to include the 2013 title that they'll pitch the coverage of the 1986 Series finale and remove the article on Valentine (really - if they're going to include a manager article, it should be on Terry Francona, not Valentine or John Farrell) and should, in my opinion, include (much) more on the epic 2004 Yankees/Sox series. Some key highlights that I would want to see include the Idiots and their Why Not Us shirts, Dave Roberts's steal, Papi's Game 4 and 5 walk-offs, or even the Wakefield's heroics in the Game fiasco of a loss or the massive Duck parade that followed. Sure, the subsequent titles were/are great (yeah, call me spoiled), but the 2004 Championship will always be the one that broke the curse - and for that reason, to me, warrants more coverage.",5.0,"Many gems in Sox history from 1904 to 2012 - great selections overall, though would prefer more coverage of 2004",1397952000,"04 20, 2014",Sports_and_Outdoors,1.0

People riding next to you or a few feet behind can see the red laser lines very well.

To get an idea of our outside activities we ski, snowboard and go sledding every year and both children play hockey, baseball and basketball and we live in a middle class suburb of Chicago. This year we went to upper MI were my kids and their friends stay outside for hours going down hills on saucer sleds (which from our testing of all the other sleds are the absolute best). All of the 6 kids with us, ages 7-10, tried these for about 2 minutes and said they suck! The spooner's would go about 4 feet and then just stop and the kids said they tilted to the side and they couldn't stay on. As for using these during the summer if you've got a bike, basketball court, baseball field or a park field around you why waste any time tooling around on this thing? In the summer my son and daughter ride a ripstick waveboard and skateboards and these are infinitely more fun than this spooner piece of crap.

It was quite a challenge though to get the 'lunitidal interval' value needed to display the correct tidal data. The manual lists the required numbers for several cities around the world, but tidal dynamics are extremely complicated and tides can differ several hours even when you go up north or south of the same coast. What made it more complicated, was that I am living in a country where English is not the main language, and I had no idea what I was looking for in local terms. Finally, I understood that lunitidal interval is known here as ""gemiddeld havengetal"" (Dutch), but still it was a real challenge to find it for the spot of coast I was planning to use the watch. It was not on the internet - ultimaltely I was able to find it in a specialized yearly nautical publication. I can imagine that not being able to find the right data, might let some users down. Casio should have realized this and should have put more effort into guiding the user to the right values. It might be the reason Casio left this option out of the newer Sea-Patchfinder models. For users in The Netherlands: I have uploaded a table at [...]As far as the watch: one problem I have with it, is that it does not have dual time, which I really need. Second, I do not understand why Casio has chosen not to print a complete 360 degree scale around the watch, but chose to print COMP, BARO and START in between the 210 and 330 degree values instead. Especially since it is also shown near the buttons as well as on the display at about the same spot. OK, it is nice to have a compass and a barometre, but don't need to read THREE times every time I look at my watch. Another disadvantage is that it is impossible to verify that the watch is level when using the compass. Especially at sea, this is essential. The watch does have some sort of tilt sensor to automatically switch on the light when you look at your wrist - it would have been nice if this feature had been used to indicate if the watch was level.A small disadvantage is the short lighting period. Having so many batteries aboard, this period could have been longer than 1.5 seconds. Also, it would have been nice if the moon graph was inverted - with the positive display showing the lighted part of the moon. Standing outside in the dark and pressing the light switch, results in seeing the dark part of the moon lighted up on your watch... Also, a button lock would have been nice. Because of its size, it is easy to press a button by mistake. Especially the Baro-button is prone to be pressed inadvertially when bending your wrist, supporting yourself during an activity.Otherwise, a perfect watch, which is extremely light for its size. The distinct beep when you return to time mode, is very handy. The glass does not scratch, it is perfectly protected by the bezel ring. I am looking for a replacement after 3 years, since the black plastic light switch broke off (it is only supported at the back by a small metal pin which is off-center, so pressing it eventually makes the connection snap) and the barometric pressure sensor went offline recently. Since I really need dual time and I do not like the newer Pathfinder model using about 1/4 of the display telling me about the battery status (what a waste of space!), I decided to compromise the tidal data and buy a Suunto watch (with button lock and sensor that indicates if the compass is level) next.",4.0,Tidal data not that easy to adjustl,1125100800,"08 27, 2005",Sports_and_Outdoors,1.0

Some reviews listed under this item are about different Pathfinder Protrek watches without the analog hands which I never seriously considered.  Analog dials have a great advantage - you can take a split-second glimpse and still know what time it is, and combined with digital dials they give you an abundance of available readings.  I have been looking for and buying only ana-digi watches like this because of their functionality and flexibility.The greatest selling point of this watch is the perfect combination of features that I am always looking for (listed in order of importance):- Analog-digital multi-function watch- Solar- Shock-resistant- Compass- Barometer- AltimeterSo far, I have been very proudly using this watch every day for two and a half years and it is still my #1 functionality-features watch in the world.  Although it's not listed as anti-shock but as ""Tough Solar"" it really is a very tough engineering work of art.  It still works perfectly even though it has gone through a significant number of abusing events.  Besides the annual vacation swims/dives in the sea and everyday normal movements, I'm an ex professional drummer who still frequently pats his knees in the rhythm of the music, and nowadays this watch has to withstand frequent clapping when listening to the music and playig with my daughter.  In addition, my 1.5 year old daughter used to play with it occasionally and she let it fall on the floor many times.  Moreover, this watch has two times received a hit that would have broken apart any other watch I have.  Once I accidentally hit a corner of a rock wall with it so hard that my hand hurt.  In spite of my expectations, all those abuses have only left a single barely visible scratch in the middle of the glass and several minor scratches on the bezel, so I can testify that the crystal/glass on it is very scratch resistant and the watch really is very tough.  I bought the titanium model/bracelet, so the entire watch is very light in spite of its size.The solar charging works great and the battery is almost always on H (high) position, and only in December during long nights and short days it sometimes goes to M (medium) and the contributing factor might be that I have the automatic backlight set up and it frequently lights up even when I don't need it.  When I get the M reading I can quickly charge the watch if I leave it in the window for half an hour during a sunny day because in the winter it is often covered with my sleeve when I'm outside.  Usually, instead of charging I like to push the envelope and see whether I can get it to L (low), but I've never seen that so far. At night and during prolonged low light conditions, the watch shuts off its digital displays to save power, but once you move the watch (or turn the backlight on), they turn on automatically and instantaneously.Some people complain about inaccurate temperature readings on watches like this, but you have to be aware that there is no way your watch will not get influenced by your body temperature, so you need to take it off and leave it for several minutes before you can get an accurate reading.  The only exception is when you are swimming/diving and you can obtain a reasonably accurate measurement of the water temperature in a matter of minutes without taking the watch off, especially if you are moving your arms and swimming or if water is otherwise flowing around the watch.The barometer/altimeter is accurate (of course, if you adjust it prior to your trip to a known reference point).  I always watch it on the airplane where you can tell which passenger plane keeps the air pressure best (or also which company is trying to save and scrape on air supplies and maintain low pressure)  - sometime you'll see the pressure drop about 33% before they adjust it and so the reading of the altimeter in a pressurized plane cabin is not at all accurate.  The internal artificial pressure they keep in the passenger cabin usually corresponds to 4000-6500 feet above the sea level.The compass function works well, but I think they should have allowed it to work for a longer and possibly adjustable period of time before shutting itself off automatically after 20 seconds.  I know it takes a considerable amount of battery power to run the compass but still, I'd like to have the option to run it for 30 seconds or a minute without having to press the button repeatedly.There is more I'd like to see and buy in a better watch and I have been looking for it for years, but I still haven't seen one as good as this.The only two main competitors I considered for a while were Tissot's T-Touch and Citizen's Eco-Drive Skyhawk.  The T-Touch watch, as seen in the James Bond movie is a bit less bulky and more dressy, so it looks better, but you have to spend about double the amount on it.  Still, if it were solar I wouldn't hesitate to buy it, but since it's not, in my referent system that translates to a waste of time and money when the battery runs out and a questionable water resistance after replacement, so it's out of the question.  Citizen's similar solar bulky watch Eco-Drive Skyhawk is a bit more dressy, but its digital and analog dials are not independent and from some reviews I can also conclude that it's definitely not as tough and resistant as this one.  Omega had an amazing ana-digi multi-function Speedmaster X-33 watch that was a serious candidate for my favorite, however, that one was not solar powered, it was many times more expensive, and it is not being made any more, so Casio's PRG60T-7V still owns the ""THE WATCH"" title in my world.Some minor cons:- I'm 6'3"" and not skinny, and although together with the titanium bracelet it does have a rugged sturdy look, I'd like it to be a bit smaller, and definitely thinner.- Position of start/stop/reset buttons on the stop watch function is unusual.  The lower right button is used to start and stop and the upper right is used to reset (I'm used to the opposite).- The color of the first circular layer under the bezel (I suppose this is the solar charging part) is gray but in some light it gets an ugly-ish  purple shade- It takes a long time to circle almost 12 hours if your watch is one minute fast because I can only adjust the hands forward.  Fortunately, the watch is pretty accurate and I only do this several times a year, two  times because of the DST switch.Things I would like to see in a future improved model:- Atomic world-wide time adjustments- Count down timer.All in all, this is as good as it gets. I have been searching for a better watch for years, but I still haven't found what I'm looking for.",5.0,I can't find a better watch,1202515200,"02 9, 2008",Sports_and_Outdoors,1.0

I am a disabled female veteran so often this type of blind is better for me.  The ""named brands"" were ok.  The problem is that some just have an open window (which deer hate and I feel uncamoed and in full view) and another has 2 zippered flaps in front with the option of magnets holding up some netting should you want that.  That has been good, but usually problems occur if you are not on solid ground because the magnets won't hold the netting up.  So I would purchase magnets on my own to double up on the magnets in the blind, to help keep the netting in place.  However, with this No Name Chair blind this problem has been solved.  YOu have several options here.  You can unzip the solid front flap and have full netting.  The netting is CROSSWAYS rather than vertical.  Because of this you can slip your gun through the netting. This means your face and head are more covered.  If the shooting slit is up and down like the others your face and head movements can be seen.  Anyway, The other option is to close up the main flap and zip around  a smaller flap, still allowing you to slide your gun through the sideways slit.  Head and face pretty much camoed by the netting. Since I have a cervical spine injury I sometimes have to move my head and neck after sitting stationary.  This allows me to stretch my neck/head a bit without to much of a problem.  Only other difference from the more expensive named ones is there is only one drink holder on the chair inside (rather than 2) .. no big deal there and this does not have any ""pockets"" in side to put calls or stakes in.  BUT, there is a zippered pocket on the carry bag that holds stakes in that.  So all in all I am very pleased with this thing.  The stakes are a bit flimsy as are all of them for all brands and I will probably buy a more sturdy kind, but that does not detract from this blind.  The seat is roomy, does have a zippered opening at the bottom of the front, which is standard with all chair blinds I have found, so it is a pretty good comparison.  Again, I have to stress for me, the options on the front of this chair blind is what sells it for me and why I will purchase a second one.  Far more concealing (of my face and head) and gives me a more ""concealed feeling"".  Oh yes, it has to fairly largecovered and netted windows on the side. But I will use these only for viewing. I am not able to move a rifle to the side window without the blind moving but perhaps someone else could.  But those windows are great for air and for viewing game etc.  One last thing.  It does not have ties in places such as on the top and sides to allow you to tie a small branch to help with camouflage  Though I do actually like the camo enough not to worry about this.  Perhaps someone might take a star away because of this but I like the horizontal shooting netting so much I am not going to be concerned about minor flaws.  Shipping was fast and came very well packaged.Dec 17, 2012  Writing to give some updated information.  The blind broke at the back of the chair.  I contacted the seller.  They took immediate action.  I sent photos of the damages and they got a second blind out to me immediately.  The sent me a return UPS label so I could send the damaged one back.  The entire experience was easy and quite satisfactory.  Their communication with me was immediate and complete.  We will gladly deal with these folks again.

But in 1976, Sparky Anderson's star-laden Cincinnati Reds did just that, taking their second straight world crown by defeating the New York Yankees, four games to none.Led by catcher Johnny Bench, who was Series MVP, the Reds knocked off the Yanks by scores of 5-1, 4-3, 6-2, and 7-2.  And this came on the heels of Cincinnati's three-game sweep over the Philadelphia Phillies in the NLCS. 7 wins and 0 losses for the Reds in the '76 post-season!Cincy batted at a .333 clip for the four games of the '76 World Series; while New York could muster just a .222 team batting mark. The club ERA stats were equally one-sided in favor of the Reds -- Cincy's ERA was an excellent 2.00; the Yanks' pitchers amassed a poor 5.45 mark.28-year-old, 9-year veteran Johnny Lee Bench was on fire during the '76 Series, hitting .533 (8-for-15), with 2 home runs and 6 runs-batted-in. Bench also had 1 double, 1 triple, and 4 runs scored. He struck out just 1 time in the 4 contests.  This World Series performance helped to make up for Johnny's poor 1976 regular season (.234 / 16 HR / 74 RBI).Other top hitters in the '76 Series included George Foster (.429 batting average), Dave Concepcion (.357), Dan Driessen (.357), Joe Morgan (.333), Tony Perez (.313), and Cesar Geronimo (.308).On the losing Yankees' side, Thurman Munson was a hot hitter, batting .529, with nine hits in the four games. Future Reds' manager Lou Piniella hit .333 for the Yanks during the Series.Dan Driessen of the Reds had the distinction of becoming the very first National Leaguer to be used as a Designated Hitter in the World Series.  Starting with this '76 Series, the DH was used in alternate World Series. In later years, a more sensible system of utilizing the DH was implemented, whereby the DH is only used in the A.L. ballparks. The pitchers are now forced to bat in World Series' games hosted by National League teams.Cincinnati's Reds won 102 games during the regular season in '76 (following up their 108 victories from 1975), and won the N.L. West title by 10 games over the Los Angeles Dodgers. The third-place team (Houston) finished a very distant 22 games behind the surging Reds.1976 also represented Cincinnati's 5th trip to the post-season during the first 7 years of the decade of the '70s (missing out on making the playoffs only in 1971 and 1974). The team would find winning their division much more difficult in future seasons, however. The Reds finished a distant second (to the Dodgers) in 1977, the year they acquired pitcher Tom Seaver from the Mets in mid-season. And they finished in 2nd place again in '78. In 1979, the Reds rounded out a successful decade by winning the N.L. West, but losing in 3 straight to the Pirates in the playoffs.MLB Home Video produced this VHS video, which is narrated by former big-league catcher Joe Garagiola. What with there only being the minimum of four games played during this '76 Series, the video's run time isn't very long (29 minutes). But all the pertinent info and game highlights are included in this color video program. (The picture quality isn't very much to write home about though.)One quibble regarding this video's packaging -- On all other World Series VHS videos put out by MLB Home Video, the team winning the Series is listed first on the box sleeve (both front and back). But, for some unknown reason, the 1976 Reds are listed SECOND on the packaging (e.g.: New York Yankees vs. Cincinnati Reds). Very odd, IMO. I have yet to encounter another video in the MLB World Series collection that makes this error and displays the losing team first on the box cover.** = EDIT: That is, up until the 2005 World Series DVD, which lists the losing team (Houston) before the victorious White Sox. Starting with that '05 disc, they started showing the losing team first for several years in a row. Mighty strange. ~shrug~Anyway, it's not a big deal obviously. Just a trivial oddity that I noticed.A semi-off-topic comment (a ""1976 Memory Flashback"") --- One of the main things I recall about the 1976 Reds/Yanks World Series is being able to watch Game 1 on ""videotape"" just minutes after the game concluded at Riverfront Stadium. In '76, video cassette recorders were brand-spanking-new, and it seemed quite remarkable (at the time) to be able to ""replay"" Game 1 of the World Series and see, at my leisure, how Don Gullett beat Doyle Alexander, 5-1.The video machine used to record that particular game was one of the early, bulky ""Betamax"" units. Remember those babies? They cost about $2,500 in '76 and didn't even include a built-in timer/clock! The timer, which resembled your bedroom's clock-radio, was a separate box that sat atop the Beta recorder. And it took TWO Beta tapes to record the game, because those tapes could only hold one hour of material. Can you imagine that today? Thank heavens for DVDs, huh?  :)To be quite technical, it might very well have taken even a THIRD Beta videotape to capture every pitch of Game 1 of the '76 Series, with the exact game time being 2 hours and 10 minutes. So, unless those old-time tapes had about 5 minutes of ""extra"" tape tacked on to their 1-hour spools (which is likely, similar to VHS tapes nowadays), then I guess a third tape must have been utilized to get the final ninth-inning out of Game #1. That final out in the Reds' 5-1 win, for the record, was a foul pop-up caught by third baseman Pete Rose, hit by Yanks' pinch-hitter Oscar Gamble. Pedro Borbon was on the mound and threw that last pitch of the game. Oh, btw, Gamble wore uniform number 23. Borbon wore #34. -- Now THAT'S baseball trivia at its finest! :-)For those who can recall the Cincinnati Reds' short-lived, two-year ""dynasty"", this video serves as a valuable keepsake and reminder of when the Reds sat atop the major-league baseball world.",5.0,Reds Over Yanks In 4-Game Sweep!,1099526400,"11 4, 2004",Sports_and_Outdoors,1.0

You can do just about anything with these bands. I use these bands to pre and post exhaust my body parts during a workout, but you can certainly use them as tools for the main bulk of your workout. I find the bands extremely helpful for arms (shoulders, biceps, triceps), abs (resistance decline situps), and chest (pushups), but you can probably find ways to incorporate every body part. I would recommend YouTube/Google to find creative ways in using these things. If you go beyond the listed exercises, you'll have a much better workout.

(2) It is more satisfying to see tangible progress with weights (15 lbs last time, 20 lbs today), than with bands (blue to green, or worse, small loop to big loop).

I started the P90x program, however, and unless you have a full weight set lying around (which is quite unlikely for college kids like myself), it is quite difficult nailing the weight that the workout requires. Seeking alternatives, I contacted the seller for some info and was quite surprised by the service I got.Normally, when you need something from an online company, it is a royal pain in the butt to get helpful advice from a real and knowledgable person. This time, however, I felt like I stumbled upon the pot of gold at the end of the Customer Service Rainbow. The seller was super responsive and extremely enthusiastic about his products! He took me under his wing and helped me find the perfect set of bands for my needs. He even checked up after they arrived to see how I liked them! I had to pinch myself because I thought I was dreaming. Nobody checks up on their products nowadays!This purchase has given me new faith in online shopping. The product is way better quality than you pay for and the service is unrivaled.

But I have to agree with the reviewer who wrote something along the lines of, ""So what if they wore out and broke, it means you're using them! Buy another set and wear those out too!"" I love that review.These bands are so portable and easy to store, there is just no excuse to not do a workout. On nice days I've been using them outside in the fresh air, on the colder rainy days we've had lately I just use them indoors. So easy.I'm finding you can replicate almost all of the primary freeweight exercises, and several of the gym equipment exercises. There are a couple books out there that have good photos and sample circuit workouts. I bought one called ""Resistance Band Workout"", by James Milligan. It has some great photos and explanations, and tells you exactly which muscle group you are working with each exercise. I have also found some great instructional videos on BodyBuilding.com. Have a look at several references, and develop your own workout. I combine mine with lunges, squats, and cardio so I get about an hour and a half of a great workout that leaves me ""just right"" sore for the next day or two.While the bands will never take the place of ""real"" weights in my opinion, they are a superb alternative.My bands arrived in two days, but that's because I have the Amazon Prime two-day shipping thing.I really hope this helps you to decide whether or not to try these out, and if you do, please check out the above references, because they really helped me. After a fairly long haitus from ""organized"" workouts, I am getting back into it, feeling fantastic, and I find the bands are just so accessible that workouts are really easy to keep up on.And best of all: no more, oh I Have to drive to the gym, but first I Have to fix my hair and put on a fancy matching workout suit and fix up a sporty ""natural healthy girl"" makeup style so I look really cute while I'm in there... you can do these anywhere at home, wearing whatever you are comfy in, and sweat as hard as you want without wondering if your mascara is running.

They flex well, and seem to show no signs of breaking/tearing. I'm satisfied with their quality. If I had one biggest complaint about them, it's that you cannot really get too much weight out of them. In order to get to ~60lbs of resistance, you need to link up three different bands. Admittedly, with bands you can always just create more tension to get more resistance (by creating a loop on the floor; look up videos on youtube if you're curious) instead of just attaching more bands, but I don't like putting that much strain on my bands. If you're expecting these bands to turn you into the Hulk, come back down to earth and rethink what you're buying them for. If you're using these to put on a little size, tone, or to supplement your use of heavier dumbbells/machines, then I'd highly recommend these. I'm using them for P90X, and I have no complaints.

You know tied to the bannister for one, looped around a door handle for another, wrapped around the table leg for another....So the end result that it was such a pain I tended to not do my exercises. I was considering joining a gym until I ran across the Black Mountain Kit. Using this kit with the door jam feature and handles makes it so easy I'm doing my PT all the time and am looking forward to building even more muscle after I'm healed.The instructions for different exercises that comes in the box aren't as comprehensive as what Black Mountain has on their website.Overall a well built product at a great price. I think all Chiropractors and Physical Therapist should sell Black Mountain Products in their offices.

Previously I have been using weights, however, I hurt my back pretty badly doing one of Tony Horton's lawnmower exercises (not his fault, I stupidly pushed myself too far!!)At first, when my injury dragged on, I wanted to try just doing the non-back exercises, but I found that I still couldn't as trying to lift a heavy weight to do some arm exercises still aggravated my back.  I started researching back problems, and someone recommended switching to bands for this very reason.My only previous experience with bands was with EA Sports Active, and they were terrible.  There wasn't enough resistance, and the bands broke far too easily.My experience with these BMP bands is a complete 180 from the EA ones.  First, these have an incredibly sturdy metal clip on either side of each band, which attaches to a comfortable handle.  Bands can be added and detached easily, and even combined to increase the weights without having to buy more bands!For my back exercises, I found that I could very easily just pick the very easy yellow bands, and do extremely light exercises even though I was still recovering.  This allowed me to assess my situation without endangering myself even more.  After three weeks, I am moving up to the green bands (the middle one) on my back, confident that yellow and then blue were no problem for me on the previous weeks.As a final note, I'm fairly tall (6'2"") and I was concerned that my height would affect the efficacy of bands in general.  I was completely wrong about this; using resistance bands seems to be a personal thing.  You experiment with various combinations, you can adjust where your feet are, you can loop the bands, etc, until you ""find the burn!""  Then you jot that down, and you're set for next time.",5.0,Great bands!!! Bands > Weights if you have a back problem!,1314057600,"08 23, 2011",Sports_and_Outdoors,1.0

The picture shows everything you get, and it's just about all you need for your exercises. You get:- 5 x resistance bands with clips: You can easily mix-and-match for more resistance. The resistances aren't labeled, however, and sometimes I get mixed up with red/black and blue/yellow, because they're both about the same thickness and I forget the order of increasing resistance.- 2 x handles: Decently padded with foam, but I wish the handles were a bit more structured, because on some exercises, the nylon straps on the handle scrape against my hands. Not a big deal, and more of a nuisance than anything.- 1 x door anchor: Works fine, just make sure your door doesn't flex very much.- 1 x velcro limb strap: I've never used this to strap onto my arm or leg. Instead, I usually use it to wrap around staircase railing or various poles around the house as an anchor, so that I can simulate pulley-type exercises.- 1 x carrying bag: Not very robust, just a cinching pouch made from that weird papery-clothy material.As of this review, I had used this set for five months, and everything's mostly held up.

(300 lb squat, 320 lb deadlift x 5, 190 lb bench press...so far)  I bought these resistance bands to warm up my shoulders before heavy lifting and to allow my wife and kids to do assisted chin-ups.  They work for those tasks quite well, but they surprised me by how useful they are for ""assistance"" exercises like hamstring curls and glute extensions that I would otherwise need gym equipment (cable system) to perform.  (OK, maybe not a heavy lat pull-down, but chin-ups or assisted chin-ups if you must are much better anyway.)  If you put both handles in one hand, you can approximate a ""fat bar"" dumbbell to build grip strength.  These bands provide all of the resistance I need for non-barbell assistance lifts.  Seriously.  The benefits when traveling are obvious, which is another reason I bought them.OK, so this is an endorsement for resistance bands in general so far.  I will say without reservation that my Black Mountain bands are very well made, as are the handles, ankle strap, and anchor, and they are easy (and fun!) to use/clip/unclip.  The price is fantastic.  The lifetime guarantee is nice, too.I was initially disappointed that there was only one ankle strap, but you only really need one for standing glute work.  (Leave it loose enough to slide your foot in and out to avoid clipping/unclipping.)  And it's big enough that I can secure it around both ankles for hamstring curls if I wish.

These bands are meant to last (if taken care of and directions followed). I try and work out on my off days from running. These bands just make things easier and it makes me want to work out.  I now have a gym in a bag that I can use pretty much anywhere.  I'll be taking the kit on vacation with me next month.  The best thing is that I can work out, still be in eyesight of my kids and also not worrying that my kids are going to drop heavy weights on their feet.  If I could give these bands 10 stars I would.

I just wanted to say that I've compared the BMP bands with other resistance band products I've used and these bands are definitely more superior in both quality and strength.I also train with them myself, and enjoy the interchangeability of the bands, (it's more convenient for my clients when doing circuit training). I'm not really nervous that some part of the band is going to break if I'm hard on them, mainly because I've gone through literally hundreds of resistance bands over the years and BMP bands are by far the most durable I've had the chance to work with.I know their only rubber and rubber doesn't last forever, it just like anything else has a resistance threshold especially being used as much as I use them, but for the price their fantastic. I recommend these bands to all of my clients for traveling purposes and every day workouts.I feel that the design overall is tremendously better and being able to stack the bands on one handle creates a great workout not only for me, but my clients as well, A BIG PLUS. I also like the extras that are included in the package like the ankle strap and door anker, you don't get those with a lot of other packages and if you do, you have to pay more in order to get them most of the time.I even called BMP to drill down on their product even more because I believe in getting what I pay for and the customer service was impeccable. They answered all my questions, they were very personable and were extremely helpful. That's what impressed me the most, hence why I'm writing this.All-in-All, I'm really happy with my purchase and would recommend BMP bands to others and would also recommend them if you're planning on using bands for high intensity workouts such as the P90X program, aerobics classes and other circuit training exercises like I perform with my clients.

I can't run 5 minutes now without my hips or knees hurting a lot. A lot of online sources told me to use resistance bands, and my physical therapist's opinion too sealed the deal.Thus, I have found myself ordered these from the good reviews. The products are good, but as someone who had never ever seen these before, I admit I was unsure how to use them. The instruction manual wasn't particularly helpful because it shows a single position and what it was called, along with terminology I wasn't 100% sure about. I don't even know which muscles are being trained, or what's good for runners like me. Thankfully, you can go to youtube and lots of online forums to find answers.But before that, I had emailed BMP asking which exercises were best for runners at both their website and on their customer support email. No answer from either. So, along with no answer and a poor instruction manual, I am obviously questioning...how can they make good products when they don't even answer questions about the product? Not answering implies not knowing, and who wants to buy bands that haven't been tested or seemed to be developed for the purpose?I'll update if I get a response, and I've only used this product several times since it came in. I like them so far, so 4 stars for quality, minus 1 for terrible customer service and a terrible instructions manual. Example? Along with these bands, came the door anchor and ankle strap.

But as a small family owned business, we can only move forward on a few things at once, due to expenses and overhead. Our main priority at this time is to improve our quality of our equipment which we work on daily. Also, besides YouTube, I often recommend The Great Resistance Tubing Handbook: http://www.amazon.com/The-Great-Resistance-Tubing-Handbook/dp/1926534522. The book has many great tips and exercises for a fair price. Lastly, to care for the bands, always inspect the bands before use. Always check for imperfections, cuts, tears, or abrasion. If you see anything please contact us as we warranty all our bands. When using the bands, always try to work out on thick carpeting or an exercise mat. Thin carpeting or concrete floor can cause severe damage to the bands. Also, watch the shoes you wear when stepping on the bands. Shoes with lots of grip or that are worn outside can also cause abrasion to the bands.""Don't hesitate to contact them!

I've found they're very versatile once you figure out what exercises you can do with them, and they've provided perfectly adequate workouts for someone used to free weights and cable machines.  I gave the product four stars primarily based on the lack of instruction that accompanied them - the included booklet has very sparse directions for only six exercises, and in my opinion doesn't provide a very clear explanation of how to perform the exercises or how to use the extra accessories.  I would recommend a website like [...] ([...] is a good example) for more detailed guides on resistance band workouts.The resistance bands themselves are great!  I'm only 5 feet tall, so I didn't have any issues in terms of length when performing exercises that required you stand on the bands.  When using the door attachment or wrapping them around a pole, I did have to experiment before finding the best way to position myself; I found that standing with my legs in a staggered, lunge-style position provided the most stable base for exercises like a standing chest press.  Also, positioning the bands overhead using the door attachment allowed me to kneel or sit in order to perform lateral pulldowns.  The door strap has proved to be extremely useful, and I haven't had any issues with its sturdiness.  I've used it with door frames that are quite old, and if anything I would advise users to make sure the door you use reliably stays closed.The interchangeability of the bands is definitely one of the biggest selling points of this set.  I really like that each band has its own attached clips at each end; it makes it faster to change resistance, which is important when you're doing a circuit with limited rest between sets or moves.  You can incrementally change resistance by adding or removing multiple bands, or by shortening the amount of slack you allow at the beginning of an exercise.I also like that the handles are padded - I imagine using the bands would be uncomfortable with hard handles.  The size of the handles is perfect for me, but I'm a fairly petite girl, so for a guy with large hands they may be a tight fit.I'd definitely recommend this set if you're looking for a good basic resistance band package.  For someone looking for heavier weight, the guide indicates there is an additional orange band you can purchase that goes up to 40 lbs.  This set fit my needs as is, and I'm excited to find more ways it can enhance my fitness repertoire.",4.0,Good Resistance Bands,1293580800,"12 29, 2010",Sports_and_Outdoors,1.0

I hate having to go to the gym, and this product has made it easy to complete my strengthening at home.The first thing I noticed about this product, from the moment I held one of the bands in my hand, was the quality.  The bands are thick and smooth, and are secured to nylon straps which have carabiners for attachment to the hand grip.  I've used it for almost two weeks now and it's durable and easily stored.  It comes with a nylon tote bag, which makes it easy to hide or transport.  Inside the bag is a manual which tells you how to mix the bands for more resistance.  Put simply, the bands do exactly what they are supposed to.I wouldn't recommend this product for anything but rehab.  Real strength is gained by working and sweating in a gym, not with bands such as these.  That's not to diminish the quality of this product, but if you're seeking size and power, buy yourself a gym membership.My only complaint is that the carabiner does not attach easily to the door wedge piece.

The quality of the actual band material is first rate.  I'm not some sort of expert who can tell what kind of synthetic material they are made of, I've only had them for two weeks, and I'm certainly not strong enough to impress you with a story about how I pulled my truck down the driveway with them.  But, I am smart enough to know that the bands are all smooth, with no signs of defect and that they have a consistent stretch throughout the length of the band.  They are securely connected to the snaps at either end.Oh yeah, those snaps at the end of each band....that's why I bought these to begin with.  You'll notice some of the other sets available have handles permanently attached to each band.  That might work if each of those bands are exactly the weight (resistance) you want to use.  But if you want to combine two or even three bands it's going to be pretty difficult with two or three of those handles.  With these bands you simply choose the bands you want to use, clip them to the handle and you're all set.  And with all the bands in the set you have a pretty good idea of the weight range you get.Lastly the handles...perfect.  Foam padded the entire circumference of the handle along with flexible, heavy duty nylon strapping, and sturdy D rings to attach the bands to.I'm very happy with these bands and can't imagine some of the others costing 3 times as much are at all a higher quality.

This type of product is certainly convenient to use and offers a fair amount of resistance for my purposes. However, for those intent on building gobs of muscle, weights are of course ideal. I found that I needed some time to adjust to the feel of these bands. While the manual indicates some type of pound rating it doesn't feel accurate. The nominal rating of weak to strong is a better way to judge the resistance of each band. I chose a familiar exercise that would allow me to work through a range of bands. I knew what I  could lift with weights and compared that sensation to the band with a similar resistance. From there I could start to estimate which bands i might start with  for other exercises. The kit is nicely put together with a wide range of bands and extra straps for doors and ankles. The carrying bag holds everything without being cramped and is well suited for travelling. As another reviewer noted, the bands are rubber and are subject to wear. It behooves the user to inspect them regularly before use.Update: I have used this kit several times now and wanted to add a finding. I found the exercises more satisfying when contracting and holding the muscles being worked on at the end of the positive movement. This gives extra focus to the area at hand and makes the most out of the resistance that the bands offer.

I enjoy a simple workout that I do with Black Mountain Resistance Bands (tubes).  My workout consists of Overhead Press, Lateral Raises, Upright Rowing, Biceps Curls, Triceps Extensions, Standing Row, Chest Press and Calf Raises; then as golf season get closer I add Overhead Wood Chop (R&L;),  Standing Side Twist (R&L;) and Reverse Wood Chop (R&L;). These last three are very helpful in getting back into the rotation mode you will need for your golf swing, and if you are like me you need all the help you can get.The Black Mountain Resistance Bands (tubes) are color coded which makes it easy to select the right resistance for what you need.  The ones I have are Yellow 2-4lbs., Blue 4-6lbs., Green 10-12lbs., Black 15-20lbs. and Red 25-50lbs; and you can combine these to make other various resistances.  This package also includes a door anchor that is great for two reasons.  The first it allows to try quite a few more exercises by giving you a stable anchor at various heights on the door.  This anchor has the blocking necessary to prevent it from slipping through the door when shut, but it is small enough to slip through the crack in the door from the front.  This allows you to position it exactly where you want it quickly.All these various bands(tubes) and the combinations allow you to personalize your workout by switching or combining the tubes to give you the resistance that works for you.  It also allows my wife to use the same equipment (two for the price of one), which make it very cost efficient.  It takes almost no room for storage and we can take it any where we go on vacation.Great product, very pleased and I highly recommend it.D.

Whatever you do, make sure you get a number of bands (just like this set!)When I started P90X I used just one braided Reebok resistance band, because I didn't think I'd need multiple different resistance strengths. I was wrong. Certain exercises were too light, no matter how big I made the loop, and certain exercises too heavy, even with no loop. The problem, especially with making a really big loop, is that you overstretch the band and before you know it, it tears. Mine tore within 2 months.The BMP set, however, is great. I use all five bands, from the lightest one (yellow) for straight arm shoulder flies to a combination of the heaviest ones (red and black) for bicep curls. Speaking of which, this is a really clever system that allows you to use multiple bands in one exercise, so you can create your own weight. Really smart. The door hook anchor is also cleverly made, with no metal parts, so if for some reason your door isn't strong enough, at least no metal will be flying in the direction of your face.The only thing I would do is call BMP before they ship your stuff, and ask them if you could order an extra set of handles to be shipped along with your order. It makes switching between bands (and therefore between exercises) so much easier!

As a pastor in my late 50's, I don't get a lot of exercise, nor do I have a lot of extra time or money. I wanted something small and inexpensive - not a weight machine that I would have to set up in the basement. My wife suggested exercise bands. After a quick review, I determined that 1) I needed a complete set to have enough for a good workout, 2) they had to me made well (many reviews complained about weak stitching and other failures). BMP's ""new and improved"" set (that included a Door Anchor - which I use in about half the exercises I do) seemed like the best choice.As a former engineer, I look closely at design, workmanship and quality of materials. I have not seen other brands up close, but I am very impressed with this set from BMP. The straps connecting the handles to the bands are made of heavy ""ballistic nylon"", with an extra piece added to double the thickness where the heavy duty metal grommet is located. To keep the bands from pulling through the grommet, they appear to have something like a large ball-shaped bead over the tubing with a tough rubber sleeve over that - a very nice design. The handles have a somewhat thin, but comfortable padding. The clips that attach the bands to the handle are heavy-duty and easy to clip with a single motion.Before my first workout, I tried each exercise to determine what band combination I would need. I then ordered my workout to somewhat minimize the number of band changes -- but I was surprised how quickly I could change them out. I was also pleased with the variety and quality of the exercises - I thought bands would be a poor substitute for machines and free weights, but in many ways I find bands to be better - especially compared to the kind of machines you can afford for home.One of the things I found to be lacking with the BMP set was exercise instructions - they only have six exercises. If they just printed one more double-sided piece of paper they could have added an additional 12 exercised. So I found a good small booklet - ""The Great Stretch Tubing Handbook"" for $8.95.",5.0,Just right for an out-of-shape pastor.,1309910400,"07 6, 2011",Sports_and_Outdoors,1.0

I couldn't do shoulder presses, any type of dumbbell presses or flies, tricep pullovers, preacher curls, bench press, rear deltoid flies, barbell squats, etc. Upon switching to the resistance bands I have been able to do all of these exercises and more with no problems whatsoever.  And I have been doing very heavy resistance with the bands.  After having a bad shoulder for over 20 years, I never dreamed this kind of intense workouts would be possible again. the resistance bands have strengthened my shoulder.  I am stronger now than I have been in a long, long time.the bands are strong and sturdy.  I have no problems lifting them overhead, clipping on 3 and 4 bands at a time.  I did buy some loop bands from discount-bands.com, which seems to be a part of Amazon.  they are unbreakable.  I do squats, shrugs, and heavy stuff with the loop bands.  the squats are great with the loop bands, with less stress on the back than a barbell.

I'm very happy with it.  In particular:- The band ends swivel to prevent twisting or binding.- The grip rotates as well, making for very smooth motion when doing standing curls, tricep kickbacks, or any other motion more complex than a straight pull.- The clips and stacking hardware are very high quality, and the stackable nature of the bands (can work with one, two, three, or more different bands at once) allows me to get a lot of variety in resistance from low resistance for tricep work all the way up to very high resistance for pull-downs.- Door hardware works great.- One set of handles and a pile of bands packs a little tighter than a set where each band has its own handles.Minor downsides to be aware of:- the stacking hardware can be problematic (scrape you) if trying to do exercises where you draw the band across your body such as overhead tricep extensions.  Usually just means adjusting your technique a bit.- When using stacked bands it can be harder to vary length by stepping on a loop of the band.

The gentleman on the phone immediately incited that they would send me two replacement bands for free by express mail.  He also indicated that given it was the two strongest bands that had broken....I probably needed more weight...which was true.  I was going to ask to purchase a stronger band.  He indicated that along with the two replacement bands he would send me one harder band for free.  Really impressed with their product and with their support.  Both band broke when I was using them with very little space between my foot and the handle...so a lot of stress on a  very short piece of material....I am still learning.

They worked well enough for the first couple of weeks although I felt I wasn't getting as much as I could out of the workout using bands compared with free weights. After a couple of weeks, the red band started showing signs of tearing on both ends about an inch from where the band connects with the handle. It seemed to still hold up to stress so I didn't think much of it; however, later that week, one end snapped and whipped my back, leaving a huge red, stinging imprint in its wake lol. I wrote an email to Black Mountain's customer support address to see about using the &#34;Lifetime Warranty&#34; that's advertised to get a replacement band; it's been about a month since sending the email and I've yet to hear back from them. I went out and bought free weights to use instead and I'm MUCH happier! As suspected, I wasn't getting the most from my workout with the bands. Using the free weights provides a much more intense workout than I experienced with the bands and my muscles are actually sore the next day.

But now that they changed to standard carabineers instead, I decided to buy a second set, which I use more regularly. Also I recommend getting the new extra strength orange and purple bands, sold separately. I would say the only drawback may be is that the bands, all bands not just the two mentioned, are a little short for some people, and probably best suited for people in the 5'4"" to 5'9"" range. I'm not saying people below and above that range shouldn't get a set. Let me just make it clear the height range I gave is not a concrete standard. It's just an opinion as to how I feel. I'm 5'11"" and I'm very careful how I use my bands. Black Mountain is a very good company with awesome customer service, and they're always working on improving their products.

They seem to be of good construction and thus far (about 2.5 months) they've held up without fail.  The door exercises have been especially brutal (good brutal) and leave our arms feeling like rubber.

This aside, and regardless of price, if given the choice between these and the free-weights again I'd pick the bands for simplicity, convenience, and greater versatility.  While you may not know exactly how much your ""lifting"", the bands help you to focus more on pushing your muscles to their breaking point and less on what weight you are using.  Additionally, with the bands you're able to accomplish many many more exercises than you ever could with free-weights.

First, you only have one level (plane) of motion possible and two, and no small problem, is a tendency for the band to fly off the door know and smack you like an angry thug. Who knows what it does to the door handle over time. Anyway, saw reviews of this and decided to give it a try. WOW! Exceeding my expectations-the door anchor works great and at any level you want to set it at. The bands are color coded and correspond to the PT bands in terms of strength. Except for an upper arm bike (I don't have a few thousand bucks lying around to spare), there is nothing I did at physical therapy that I can't do at home. Even better, PT didn't have handles for their bands and wrapping them around your hands gets old real fast. This product has handles to hold instead of strangling your hands. In every way a winner. Easy storage is icing on the cake.",5.0,Terrific in place of physical therapy bands,1389916800,"01 17, 2014",Sports_and_Outdoors,1.0

We are in the basement and the ceiling hook I installed is only about 7'8"" off the ground, which means that my wife has to sit back a bit from the mount point for the bands to be stretched enough to give a good amount of resistance.

As it is just paper - it falls apart quickly if you pack the kit in your suitcase and it can be a bit of a challenge to remember which bands are what when you are trying to achieve a particular resistance, or trying to chart your improvement like you do with P90 programs.

WIth that said, I am very happy with my purchase thus far. I purchased these bands a little over 3 months ago and have been using them with the P90x exercise videos among other workouts. The bands feel sturdy and well-made. I admit the first few weeks using the door anchor I half feared the bands would break anyway and snap back to slap me in the face (paranoia anyone?), but they held up beautifully. I find myself putting more and more stress on them now (getting further back from the anchor creates stronger resistance) because I know they can take it. I love the option to stack bands on the handles - there are several leg exercises I do that simply require more weight than a single band in this set can give me. Thankfully, the stacking option works great - the bands feel balanced and like I'm getting even resistance from all of them. I would like it if it were easier to attach and detach the bands from the door anchor, but at the end of the day, I'd rather have an anchor that I know will hold up.There are certain exercises that free weights really are better for, but for the most part, I've done great with these bands and just some 5 lb hand weights as a backup. It is also really easy to switch between bands during a workout, which I appreciate since my workout routines tend to move through several muscle areas and then repeat, and it involves a lot of weight switching.

For the most part these are great until you have to do a military press or an overhead tricep curl.  These exercises require you to stand on the middle of the band and push all the way up until your arms are fully extended.  For these exercises, the bands are too short for me and I worry how long they'll last if I keep stretching them that far.  I'm 6'0"" tall, so someone shorter might not have any problem.  If you're 6' or taller, I would find something longer because these will disappoint.  The B-Line bands used by Tony Horton for P90x and his other videos appear to be roughly twice as long as these.These are good quality bands though.  The grommets are strong and the clips are metal and thus, less prone to breaking.  The door attachment and ankle accessory work fine.  The ""instruction manual"" is a little sparse and simplistic but you can't expect too much there.  Suspiciously, I noticed that none of the exercises show the bands being lifted any higher than shoulder length.EDIT: I increased my review to a 4 star after using the bands a while longer and speaking to their customer service.  I also got a free orange band for my call.  According to customer service the bands can actually stretch safely up to 5 times their original size  (their max stretch is about 40 ft. although this makes them unusable).  After 3 weeks of overhead use they still show no signs of wear or tear.EDIT: Still on the fence about these.  After 6 weeks of use I had to get the red band replaced after seeing several tears appear.  Now I'm seeing tears in the black band and one tear in the new red band already.

When I saw the picture I thought it will not be big enough to take the bands out and put them in, but was I wrong. This nifty bag was a nice size and addition. Great for traveling or storage, but why will you put your bands away? WORK OUT lol.Bands: Bands are great, I have been using them for over a week now and I have no complaints. The hooks are metal and the construction is tough. I have no base to compare but this bands still look beefy and tough.Band Handles: Well the handles will not brake, at least the material. The padding for the handles seems to be of OK quality. They are used using the backpack-strap-nylon-material. They are good quality as well.Door hanger and other accessory: Well, I am using the door hanger and it works great, however, the other accessory, I have not even taken out of the pack as it seems to be an ankle strap. They are both built to last and seem good quality.Overall: I think this product has a good build quality. I am enjoying the easiness to add or subtract tension from your configuration. However, when using all the bands, the rings on the handles get a little crowded.Cons: Well, nothing is perfect so here we go. While I am very satisfied, with the product, considering the cost, I have to also point out some short comings for potential customers and also for the manufacturers own desire to improve a product. The band handles could have some better grip. I think the material could be improved on that area (I am talking about the foam part that keeps you comfortable). This is now issue for me, and if you are working out, and all you can think of is that the pads could be better, then your muscles are not burning enough add another band. Another thing that I noticed that could be improved is the hooks on the handles. Then again, these are easily available at any hardware store. Also, do not expect an exercise booklet with this package. All you get is a guide to see how much resistance each band has and what combinations you can get.Conclusion: I think this is a great product and I will recommend to any of my friends or family members who need a work out solution.

I have definitely enjoyed them thus far. They are quite easy to set up and do not occupy much space while storing. The only thing I would suggest in order to upgrade the product, is to write down the resistance range of each color band in the handle so you don't have guess what resistance you are using.

I would not recommend this to professional athletes, per se, as a substitute to lifting heavy weights for body building.  Stick to the gym if you feel the need to bench press 200+lbs.  That being said, the versatility of the band set offers users nearly the same range of exercises found on a BowFlex PR1000 Home Gym for a fraction of the cost.  I use the bands as part of my exercise routine 3-4 times per week.  I've been using them for about a month and, so far, the bands have held up well to the stress of the workout.  The door anchor is simple to use and will not harm your door or the doorframe in any way and the anchor holds up remarkably well to the stress placed on it during the workout.The exercise chart that comes with the product is simply a pamphlet that illustrates a few of the exercises that the bands can be used for.  In my opinion, this pamphlet is not necessary; however it could be better designed to include more detail on the exercises themselves while also giving advice on daily workout routine schedules and a prescribed number of sets/reps for each exercise.  Using a bit of creativity, you will likely find exercises that the band set can be used for that are not even illustrated in the pamphlet - such as leg extensions and leg curls.Final verdict: This is an excellent product and, if used properly, it will give you the solid workout you are looking for.

Fear of a huge investment with expensive free weights caused me to look into bands. I chose these because of positive reviews on amazon.

This feature is fantastic and adds great versatility to the product. The handles are sturdy with a firm grip. The door anchor works great.

I contacted the customer service department by email after business hours and received an email early the next business day.

I especially like that they are so modular, so I can hook them up in many different configurations to vary resistance. They are quick to attach to and remove from the handles, and seem very sturdy. I only have two minor complaints about the product itself, neither of which justifies removing a star. The first is that the D-rings on the handles tend to sometimes shift around, which can result in a sudden shift in resistance as it slips from one position to another, and seems like it could harm the long-term durability of the canvas. The second is that, since this is uncovered rubber tubing, I have noticed a few punctures in the tube from normal wear and tear. These don't seem to be weakening the tubes yet, but over time I may have to replace a couple of the more heavily used ones. To be fair, I may be using them in some slightly unorthodox ways. I figured out that I could use them to do assisted pullups by attaching both sides of the bands to the ankle strap attachment after looping one side over my pullup bar. Then I can use the ankle strap as a stirrup and stand up on it so I can do the full pullup motion without having to support my full weight. This is a little awkward, but works well, and the strap and tubes seem durable enough to be able to handle it.And now on to the customer service of Black Mountain, which I found to be outstanding. It seems that this is a small company run by two brothers, and they really want their customers to be happy. When I bought the set, it came with an offer for an even heavier orange resistance band for free. I called and they were happy to send it along at no cost given only my shipping address. When it arrived, they had accidentally sent the model with attached handles, which would not clip on to my handles. When I called to discuss it with them, they were apologetic and very quick to ship out the right product, allowing me to keep the other one that was sent by mistake. I also mentioned that the stitching on one of my handles had started to come apart, and they sent along two replacement handles with new and improved stitching.Overall, I was very satisfied with my experience with this company, and would definitely purchase from them again. The product may not have been perfect, but they stand behind it and make things right if they aren't. I have recommended these to two friends, and as far as I know, they are also very pleased with their purchase.",5.0,Good product and great customer service,1347753600,"09 16, 2012",Sports_and_Outdoors,1.0

Plus, it is said that using resistant bands works out your core as opposed to using traditional weights.My only caution:When using the door strap be extremely careful.  If you have an older style door, it will pop out when enough resistance is applied.  This is not due to a faulty door strap but rather the door in your home, it depends on how tight your door closes.  I about took my head off when I tried using the door strap.  I stretched the band for the first repetition, the door came flying open and the metal ball door strap came whizzing past my head at about 100 MPH!  Close call!

I am happy to support a company with a good product at a reasonable price.  Eventually I had to replace them though because 3/5 of them had snapped over the course of the year.

The carabiners seem lighter and less sturdy. And the bands used to be mounted on a swiveling clip, so your band never got coiled.

After a year I have lost almost 100 lbs and feel great thanks in large part to strength training.  It's still hard to keep motivated and on track.  As my work schedule ebbs and flows there are periods when I just can't get into the gym for a few days or even weeks.  After missing  workouts during these periods I see my muscles reduce and strength/mood deteriorate.After my trainer started adding resistance bands to my routine for variety at the gym, I thought that I could use similar bands at home for those days I just can't make it to the gym.  I bought this set as a lightning deal and I am really happy I did.  The probem I have had with bands like these in the past is that the available bands would only go up to 15-20 lbs of resistance and you could not really stack them.  Thanks to Black Mountain, this is not a problem with this set.  I can add or subtract as much weight as I want and still use the same comfortable grips.  I actually bought a second set so I had a much wider range of weight.  The quality is high, and the door anchor is a great addition.If I changed anything, I would like to have a door anchor that distributes the weight more across the frame.  When I use 70 lbs. or so I am worried the anchor might dent the door wood.  It has not happened yet but it would be nice to not to have to worry about that.  I would also like a way to secure the bands in the middle so I can shorten the stretch length when using a single hand.  Currently I just tie the band in the middle but sometimes it can be difficult to untie.One fantastic bonus of using the bands at home is that now my teenage son, who can't workout at the gym, has a way to build muscle for swimming and football.Great product!",5.0,Great product for those off gym days,1387065600,"12 15, 2013",Sports_and_Outdoors,1.0

I had to travel abroad and used this set to replace my usual dumbbell-based workout and it worked out very well (no pun intended). I did chest and shoulder presses, lateral raises, biceps curls, triceps pull-downs, among various other exercises.I can say it worked out very well, so much I have added band-based training to my regular workout. Although these are positive points about using bands -- and not about the product itself -- I found it worth mentioning, since many folks that will be browsing this sort of product might be seeking a substitution to their regular apparel.Regarding the set itself, it comprises a number of bands conveniently colored per resistance level. The kit is inexpensive, it includes a small bag and a nice booklet with sample exercises, straps that let you hook the bands to doors. It also includes a leg strap that I haven't yet used. The rubber does not smell much and the hooks appear to be reliable (I've been using it only for 5 months so far, but 4/5 times a week very consistently). Keep in mind that this may not be good for everyone; the ""heaviest"" band offers an estimated (by the seller) resistance of up to 30 lbs. Just to give an idea, I currently bench 50lb per hand and it works for me. The only potential issue I find is that the handle foams may wear out with regular hard grips. Still, I can see this product lasting long enough to be worth the 30 bucks I payed for it.To finalize, this is the second set I have purchased; the first one I gave to my dad, who got overall impressed with bands as an alternative to strength training.

The construction of the bands and handle hardware is much sturdier than I anticipated. I placed my order on Saturday, and with the free shippiing option, the bands arrived on my doorstep on Tuesday.

With a weight machine I was limited in the muscle groups I worked and the direction of the movement. These resistance bands afford me the flexibility of moving in all different directions.

I was also hesitant to purchase weights for my house due to cost, space needed, and possible damage to floors.I initially thought working with resistance bands would not give me the level of exercise I needed, and equated the bands to workouts for old people and physical rehab. After some research, I decided that this may not be the case and decided to give them a try. I decided on this Black Mountain Products to try it out, and after the past month or so, I've really been happy with the level of work out I get.Pros:- For a full set of bands like this, the price is really respectable- The levels of resistance, coupled with compact storage, trump having to get that many levels of dumbbells- The door anchor and ankle strap exponentially increase the number of exercises you can do, opposed to bands alone- The cable and hook designs are durable, and also allow for quick changes between sets and exercisesCons:- For the price, the value of this set is pretty awesome. Any minor issues I have at this time are most likely used to inexperience with resistance bands and definitely not worth mentioning at the price I paid for this set. My only bit of advice for the manufacturers may be to provide some links or suggested reading for exercises beyond the basic ones they present in their starter guide.",5.0,A complete home workout at a good price,1370995200,"06 12, 2013",Sports_and_Outdoors,1.0

I like the fact that the bands have clips for the handles. I bought an extra set of handles to avoid having to swap out frequently between exercises. As it turns out, a lot of times when I'm working a smaller muscle group with a single band, I won't even use the handle -- I'll just grab the end of the band near the attachment. I also really like the fact that it's easy to combine the bands to increase the weight. I haven't used the ankle strap and I'm not sure if I ever will. I have used the door attachment and it works well when used as instructed.

They come in a closeable pouch made of lightweight material. With the bands folded easily into the bag, it can be tucked away in a suitcase or even a carry-on. The whole package weighs very little and takes up very little space in your bag.Using the bands themselves is a simple task. Simply clip the bands of your choice onto the supplied handles and get to work. There is a simple set of workouts supplied by BMP. There is also a chart that details each bands' strength, along with a few combinations to achieve different weights. These bands stretch much further than you'd think while still maintaining their strength. They haven't ripped, over-stretched, or torn. The handles are comfortable to use, with foam grips that keep your hands from hurting after a tough workout. The bands can be used individually, or combined for an almost infinite (well, not quite) combination of weight for your workout. The supplied accessories -- Ankle strap, door anchor -- also work well. The door anchor can be mounted low, high, in the middle, or above the door for any number of workout positions.All in all, these bands are the perfect light-weight accessory for the on-the-go traveler, or for use at home just the same.

The bands are great, very sturdy and well built. They come on and off of the handles easily and the book that comes with the bands offers a great many exercises you can do with them. As I said, I wanted to use them with TF though, so I'm going to concentrate on that.The bands are shorter than what you get with TF by quite a bit, I can't say specifically how much as I no longer have my TF bands, but I would estimate 12"" - 18"" shorter, this is a big difference as far as intensity of exercise. I ended up switching to the green band where TF uses the red band because it was simply too much resistance. Also, where the TF bands are a continuous unit, this set of bands, since you can remove and replace for different intensity, is not a single unit. The metal portions of the bands (where they clip on and off) can rub against your arms during your exercises and it can get quite uncomfortable. I don't know how to fix this, I'm doing the same exercise I was doing with the TF bands, but it's noticeably uncomfortable and I generally have marks on my arms when I'm done because of the metal rubbing against my skin. If you plan to use the bands with something like TF, you might look into bands that are not removable/interchangeable.All of that said, this is a great set of bands and I am glad I have them.

We ordered this product for its flexibility in allowing us to not only work with the resistance suitable to us, but also the resistance suitable to the exercise (i.e. the same band wouldn't work for hammer curls and overhead shoulder presses, mostly because of the length the band would have to stretch).Upon receiving the product, the first thing we noticed is that the bands were of very good quality. These things have withstood our rigorous workouts and should last forever. The handles are also of very good quality, with a padded insert and strong nylon. The resistance bands are hooked up via latches that connect to a D-ring on the handle. I was thinking it might be difficult to quickly change out bands, but the latching action is very smooth and quick. This is important for us as we do high intensity exercise and want to move on to the next exercise as quickly as possible to keep up our heart rates. As another reviewer pointed out, the cover on the band before the latch will rub against your shoulder when doing exercise like overhead presses, but this is a minor inconvenience.The accessories included are a storage bag (very convenient), a door anchor, and a leg strap. We won't be using the door anchor or strap, but I did try it, and both worked very well. I was impressed by the comfort of the leg strap. There is also a convenient chart of the band resistance and common band combinations which comes in handy.We have greatly enjoyed using this product and are very pleased with it. The only thing we might suggest is including another set of handles to make switching between different exercises even quicker, but this is small beans compared to a great product at an even better price.

I have 4 kids under age six so I didnt feel comfortable having ""real"" weights in my home anymore so I switched to bands a few years back while a continued to use free weights at my gym.  The bands I purchased years ago didn't seem like they provided the stated resistance and wore out relatively quickly and left a bad impression.  Fast forward to today... on a friends recommendation, I bought this set and was totally blown away by the difference between these and the ones I had previously.  The resistance feels right and the bands feel solid.The best part is that my wife and I can both use this set because of the great range of band resistance and when either of us finishes, they go right back in the bag and in the closet. No need to worry about one of our little ones busting their head on a dumbbell. Even my 17yr old nephew was impressed by these.  As a self professed fitness nut, I recommend these bands highly.  Bands in general allow you to do things that aren't nearly as safe to do with free weights in regards to range of motion and are excellent for flexibility work... the key is to have high quality bands, and these are the best I've used.  The ones at my gym are downright terrible are probably the same ones they had 15yrs ago.These bands are not going to have you looking like old school Arnold (you'll need steroids for that), but if you want to get a a GREAT set of resistance bands at an even greater price, look no further.",5.0,Family weight room in a bag,1322524800,"11 29, 2011",Sports_and_Outdoors,1.0

We bought these bands to supplement our strength workouts, and have been pleasantly surprised.  They are well designed, especially with strong carabiner clips at both ends of each resistance band---which is a huge deal as it allows you to set some many different configurations, and to do it quickly.  The quality on the cables are good, and if you use them properly, they are sturdy and long-lasting.  One thing that a few reviewers have never understood about resistance bands, is that you do not stretch them to their absolute limits.  Each band is designated with a comparable free weight resistance level, and it occurs in the 50-75% of the band's stretch.  It is not occurring at the 90-100% of the stretch limit.  Most people don't realize that when they use any mftr's resistance bands, they are going way harder than they normally would with a similar free weight.  It seems they can't believe a band is giving them a workout as would a free weight (i.e. dumbbell), so they stretch them past the limits of what they should be doing.  This is akin to cranking down on your toothbrush and brushing; toothbrushes quickly degrade and can't clean your teeth if you do this.  We also want to say that BMP bands are of the same quality as other bands costing 30-40% more.

I had previously purchased some bands from a store that had athletic/workout equipment to do p90x, but when I got home to try them out, they were horrible. They didn't do anything they said they would and had no resistance. It was a complete waste of money. I did a lot of research on my next set and I ended up buying these Black Mountain Resistance Bands. So far they have been great. I was a little worried that there would not be enough resistance due to other people's comments, but they are perfect for me. I use the green, red, and black bands in place of pull ups, and that works well for now. In addition, I have an orange band (35-40lbs) coming in the mail, which in addition to the bands i already have, will definitely be enough resistance even if p90x makes me super buff. The things that I like the best about the bands is that they are high quality, you can strap on all the bands to one handle if you want, meaning you will always have enough resistance, and the door anchor is very easy to use. These are also really nice for me because I have lived in 3 different countries in the last 4 years. I have a set of bowflex weights that go up to 90lbs, but I have had to keep them in storage for the last couple years because they were too heavy to move with.

Owned the product for well over a month now and I'm using it regularly 3-5 times a week. I messed my shoulder up pretty good at work and so I had to see a physical therapist for a month. After the 6 meetings with my PT, I decided to buy these resistance bands after seeing how EVERYTHING I could do at the PT, I could easily perform at home for free. These bands really impressed me, although my expectations were low since I just needed them to do a few simple exercises for my shoulders. I've been working out with weights since I went to college, but these bands allow me to work out my muscles in many different angles that I couldn't accomplish with weights at home, and it does it in a much safer way. Once I get my shoulder back to where I want it, I'll probably return to my weights, but until then these will be perfect for my rehab.So in short-The Good: cheaper/safer than weights, great for rehabing, endless exercises you can perform with them, door mount is awesome (the ankle mount/handles included aren't very useful in my opinion)The Bad: I'm not a fan of having to combine the bands to increase resistance, only 1 set of handles for all bandsI doubt you'll find a better set of resistance bands for the price so go for it!",5.0,Shoulder Rehab,1334793600,"04 19, 2012",Sports_and_Outdoors,1.0

I saw limited use and limited results for them.  No way they could be used for any serious purpose,  I thought.  Limited to light resistance, hi-rep functional strengthening and conditioning within the confines of a physical therapist's office - boy, was I wrong!I lift 5 days a week, and love to incorporate cable machines for full range of motion resistance.  Only problem is (was) that I don't have access to a cable machine at home or on the road and getting to the gym at 0530hrs was an exercise in self-discipline.  I looked at several other band sets from many other manufacturers before selecting Black Mountain.  At this price and with a 90-day return policy and lifetime warranty, if I didn't like them I could return them or let the wife and kids use them.  Throw in &#34;Made in the USA&#34; and I figured they were worth an audition.Well, color me impressed!  I can easily replicate all of the exercises I used to perform on cables and more.  Rows, lat pulldowns, crossover chest pulls, hammer curls, concentration curls, tricep extensions and pulldowns - these have even replaced freeweights for lunges, good-mornings, and calf raises!  Even with no freeweights, you can still get a full-body workout with these bands, and add-ons are available to up the resistance.  Believe me, the pump you feel after a workout with these is every bit as good as you'll feel leaving a gym.I like the stackability of these over the individual bands with handles - you can mix and match throughout your sets to increase resistance between sets.  With the handles, door anchor, and ankle strap, there really isn't anything you can't do on the go out of the small carrying bag.The quality is great - at first I was a little hesitant to put too much weight on the thick nylon anchor, but now I am more concerned about the door frame I put it in!  The foam handles are comfortably sized, and you can even slide them in the loops to replicate pronated and supinated hand positions for various exercises.Now these can't be this good without a few minor limitations.  You do need to be creative with positioning the bands or your body to perform some exercises - you'll find them too long for some, too short for others.  I'm 6'3&#34; and my wife is 5'7&#34; - we both have to make some accommodations, but there is nothing we just cannot do.  Also, the addition or option of a bar would be awesome - hint, hint BMP!All in all, great product - we get great strength training workouts in minimal space.

They didn't work for him because of the intensity of his workout, it was too much for the bands.  Although, he did get some replaced by the company when they wore out quickly, so kudos to the company.  He gave them to me, because my workout isn't as strenuous, so he thought they would be helpful.  And they are great for what I do.  I dropped my gym membership because of cost, but still wanted to continue with one of the workouts I took regularly that used resistance bands.  (I would use these with a DVD, or exercise class, as the start up guide doesn't give a lot of information about specific exercises for toning all areas.)  These are perfect for what I do, and the variety of equipment they give you is excellent, you can change up your routine easily.  When I injured by shoulder (not seriously, just a strain), the yellow and blue bands give an easier workout without adding to the injury, and then I worked my way back up.  I'm very happy with them, and they have lasted several months even with almost daily use (full disclosure, there was a week or two where I was too lazy to do anything).  If you are looking for more serious workout/weight loss, I recommend adding other workouts to your routine, or getting more heavy duty equipment (although my body building friend told me they worked very well for him, but didn't last as long with a daily, super intense workout).  However, if you are like me and working out isn't easy to do (lack of motivation), so you stick to what you are able to commit too despite not losing much weight with it, I can recommend a supplementRaspberry Ketone Platinum (2 Bottles) - Clinical Strength - All Natural Fat Burning, Weight Loss, Diet Supplement, 60 capsules- it's a great fat burner, and helps my workout actually turn around into weight loss and fat loss.  I can't judge the products from the serious trainer point of view, but from the couch potato point of view, the bands are great for toning, and the rasp ketone makes your workout more effective in losing fat.",4.0,"Great product for getting in shape, don't recommend for serious body building",1376179200,"08 11, 2013",Sports_and_Outdoors,1.0

What is different about this set is a shocking number of reports about torn and broken bands that often caused serious injuries and even a few cases of disability. Also, it's quite unusual to read these reports in some 4- and 5-star reviews.Usually, I don't pay much attention to 1- and 2-star reviews because it's very common for people to have various reasons for dissatisfaction, which have little to do with the quality and usability of the product itself. Actually, since I was going to use the bands for rehabilitation and the number of positive reviews was overwhelming, I decided that this product should serve its purpose for me and bought it in September 2013. This conclusion appeared to be accurate, and, before writing a regular review, I decided to read again what other people were saying. And this time many reviews sounded very alarming, often, apparently, without the author's intention. What could one think reading a 5-star review that asserts that if the exercise equipment breaks, it is beneficial for the user because this indicates increased power of the user, and the sooner it happens the better? And this opinion was not an exception. Somehow, I didn't feel comfortable using this product and conducted in-depth Internet research on similar products including Amazon reviews. The results are as follows:1. As some reviewers suggested, this product had improved over time, and many reported incidents might not be relevant for new purchases, so it might be prudent to disregard old reviews. Unfortunately, many new positive reviews from 2013 mentioned various quality related issues. This could be due to incorrect use of the bands.2. Similar products sold on Amazon have much better feedback, and complains are about incomplete sets, delivery issues, wrong band size, etc., but not about damaged bands and injuries. And a few products, such as Bodylastics and JS Fitness sets have almost no negative reviews. I have no intention to advertise anything, but one should not look any farther than Amazon to find some alternatives to compare and make a choice.3. The bands certainly should not break in a few months and even years unless they are defective or damaged by inappropriate use. Of course, some drivers can wreck a perfectly good car in a few months, but it doesn't indicate they've become superior drivers. If the active or working length of a band is not stretched more than 4 times, the band should serve for many months of daily use.4. There are bands with built-in protective devices, such as inclosing sleeves and enclosed cords, which should prevent possible injuries and traumas in case of band failure.5. The flat bands might be a better alternative since their length and, therefore, resistance can be adjusted much easier. They can be folded multiple times if needed, which increases both resistance and reliability. There are extremely heavy duty flat or loop bands suitable for heavy lifting and body building.Practical recommendations:1. Inspect every band thoroughly on arrival for any possible defects.2. Test every band carefully with gradually increased load and inspect thereafter.3. Contact the manufacturer in case of any issue and/or question. They have excellent customer service, which I had a chance to verify personally on a few occasions.4. This set should be perfectly fine for light to moderate loads and/or infrequent use.5. Read the enclosed instructions before using the bands. The most important safety instructions are periodic inspections and overstretch prevention.6. If no defects are found after a few uses, the bands are likely to be in a good condition and unlikely to break without any indication of wear and tear, which can be revealed by periodic inspections.7. Avoid stretching the bands more than 4 times their active or working length. Rolling a band around the hand or reducing its length in any other way will reduce its working length. This should not be used to increase resistance (overstretch), but only if there is insufficient room for exercises. Using entire band should always be preferred.8. Using bands attached to a door, wall, post, etc. effectively doubles the resistance, saves room, and allows for greater control and variety of exercises.9. Avoid incidental cuts, pinches, scratches, etc., which can damage the band. Always inspect bands after using them in some unusual way and/or by another person.10. If the items above sound like too much hassle, consider buying more reliable and, possibly, more expensive bands with protective sleeves or cords, which will give you peace of mind and can actually be more economic.11. Read customer reviews on Amazon very carefully before buying any product if you plan to use it for vigorous and tough exercises.P.S. A huge number of trivial positive reviews might be caused by the ""free orange band reward"" promised by the manufacturer for a fair review, which can encourage many people to write a few words instead of agreeing with already existing reviews, which would have been much more convenient for new customers.",3.0,Band Reliability Review,1396051200,"03 29, 2014",Sports_and_Outdoors,0.0

Stackable bands give you flexibility with the level of resistance, but also allow you to keep stacking as you get stronger - meaning you can use this set for longer as your strength increases.2) The craftsmanship on this item is fantastic.  The point where the rubber band attaches to the end clip is really well done - reinforced and sturdy.  I don't feel nervous that it's going to snap off or break.3) the clips on the end of the bands are really top notch!  They attach simply by pushing the clip onto the D-ring on the handle.  and they open easily as well, just push on the spring-loaded hinge and slip it off the ring.

Here are my impressions after 3 weeks of use:1) Good alternative to purchasing 50 lbs of weights or a weight set. I live in a small apartment in an urban setting without a car. So the idea of purchasing a dumbbell set and having to walk home with it was not good. I bought these bands as an alternative to weights.2) The bands do take some getting use to. I still prefer dumbbells, but for a small apartment, or for people that don't have a car, or people that do a lot of traveling or moving, these bands are perfect. Think of them as a dumbbells set on-the-go.3) Unlike dumbbells, the resistance changes the further you move the grips from the ground. For instance, in one of the P90X exercises involves lifting from ground, to hip, to shoulder, to above your head. With dumbbells, you can get a consistent 50lb weight throughout the exercise. With bands, it feels like 0lb from feet to hip, 20 lbs from hip to shoulder, and 50 lbs from shoulder to above your head.4) What you get in the box: 5 bands at different resistance levels, a pair of hand grips, a door attachment, and a bag. The whole thing is really good quality. It costs $25 for the whole set, and definitely worth it considering it would cost you $75+ if you were to purchase a dumbbell set. Plus you'd have to carry the dumbbells home and find room to store them.5) The band quality is pretty good. I've only used them for three weeks, but am not worried about anything breaking. The grips have pads on them to make them more comfortable to use. The bag is nice because it keeps everything together in storage when you're not using the bands.6) I would definitely buy a set of resistance bands. Don't bother buying individual bands because you'll need different resistances for different exercises. For instance, the 15lb band might feel like 15lbs if you're doing a bicep curl (hip to shoulder), but it'll feel like 25lbs when you're doing a military press (shoulder to above your head). I'm adjusting and using different bands all the time throughout my routine.7) The door attachment is good if you don't do pull ups much. If you do pull-ups more than 2-3 times a week (if you're doing P90X, you will), then I would just pay and get a real pull-up bar.All in all, these bands are good if you want to create a gym at your place and don't have the space for a dumbbell set, travel/move a lot, work out occasionally, or don't want to spend for a dumbbell set. The bands themselves are great. It takes some getting use to. I still prefer using a real dumbbell set but for my small apartment and set up, these bands are perfect.",5.0,Great bands.

They are great construction quality and they are quite inexpensive as compared to some competing products in the same quality category.I owned other products in the past and while I am not the Schwarzenegger type for sure, I have managed to break through cheap resistance bands causing pain and/or cuts in various areas of my body. Usually the metal rings would give in under tension and the whole band snapped unexpectedly. That's why at first I was a little hesitant to but this brand and was thinking to settle on more expensive product to assure build quality. I was even more worried after closer examination of the pictures, where I've noticed that what keeps the tube connected is nothing less than the infamous metal ring that likes to fail. However the reviews were good and people mentioned that the customer support is good, so I took the plunge.When I received the product, it wasn't packed in any extravagant box or anything like that, so I wasn't sure my OEM tubes would be good after all. But, after inspecting all elements I've realized that the quality seems good overall. The metal elements appeared to be sturdy and of good quality (I would say B+ quality); the tubes looked good and smooth without any defects, and they streached evenly too; and the handles were OK.So far everything seems to be working fine and I'm slowly regaining trust in resistance bands workouts again, just rarely worrying if something will snap again and hit me.... Maybe this time a piece of the doorframe.What I like about these particular bands is that you can stack them in various combinations to create different tension. So as long as your doorframe is sturdy and you look up few exercise ideas on YouTube and other places you can pretty much work out most of your muscle groups with various exercises. It's also less straining on your joints and creates more resistance throughout the whole movement unlike working out with dumbbells.If you never worked out with the bands, then you should know they are big advantage over dumbbells. I think they work better, are more fun to work out with, are easier to store and are defiantly lighter and more portable.

The strap is then inserted between the door jamb and the door and is secured in place when you close the door.

I purchased the bands because I am in the early phases of a new workout and wasn't quite ready to invest in an expensive dumbell set.  The product came just as described and incredibly fast.  The carrying case is great especially as I plan to bring these along when travelling. The small size of the carrying case makes it ideal for travelling.  Only downside with case is that sometimes the bands gets tangled inside but only takes a moment or two to sort out.  I did wind up calling customer service with a question about proper use of the door anchor and the person I spoke with was knowledgeable, friendly, and helpful.  Wish all companies were like that.  The door anchor works well between jam and door.  I'm a bit nervous about using it at the top of the door, not because of anything specific to this door anchor, just my overall sense of the security of these door anchors where there is a slightly larger gap. Certainly don't want it to come flying out.  The quality of the bands themselves seem good.  After reading a few of the other reviews, I am going to start making it a habit to give the bands a regular quick scan for fraying and wear and tear but so far no signs.One of the other reviewers mentioned that the set only comes with one set of handles.  I, too, found this to be a bit problematic, as I use  a variety of resistance for different exercises and would like to be able to transition from exercise to exercise fairly quickly.  I found the transitioning a bit unwieldy with the carabiner clips and nylon and it was slowing me down.  I have since ordered a second set of handles and that has been helpful.  If you are looking to transition quickly I do recommend this.  I haven't started combining bands yet but I imagine that when the bands are combined the transition would be even slower.Follow-upCustomer service has been great as I had to get some bands replaced.  In talking with the customer service rep, he was able to identify a particular exercise (lawnmowers) that can place unreasonable stress on the bands if you put the focal point (i.e., foot on band) too close to handle causing an extreme stretch on small portion of band.  That was likely the culprit in the problems I was having.  I really like the stacking function of the band (i.e., combining different bands for more tension) but do get somewhat frustrated as I am trying to maintain a pace to my workouts and it is not always a quick transition and in certain workouts I need to regularly go back and forth between tensions.  It is hard to maintain the pace in those instances.  Multiple handles are helpful - I only have two but maybe three would be better, although would face the same issue if using same bands in different combinations.  Still, stacking function is great and much cheaper than dumbbells.",4.0,Solid Purchase So Far,1359676800,"02 1, 2013",Sports_and_Outdoors,1.0

To date, my impressions of the product and company are as follows:(1) the bands are very well-made and should last a long time;(2) the door anchor, which is included in the kit, is sturdy.  I&#8217;m glad the anchor was included, because it enables me to greatly increase the number of exercises I can do with my resistance bands.  I really like using the anchor, and feel confident that the anchor is secure;(3) the instruction sheet included in the kit is helpful.  I especially appreciate that it lists the estimated weights for each resistance band and includes illustrations of six basic exercises one can do with the bands.  Tip for others:  Search YouTube to find other effective resistance band exercises.(4)  Black Mountain offers a full warranty on their resistance bands!  The warranty was a selling point for me.  I appreciated that a small family owned company stands by its products (I wish more companies today did the same); and(5)  Black Mountain customer service takes customer's questions seriously.  I wrote customer service via e-mail, and received a thorough reply within 24 hours (just like the company promises in it's informational materials).  I received a reply from a human being, not a robot.I haven&#8217;t used the ankle strap, which was included in the kit, so I can&#8217;t comment on it.  However, I'm looking forward to using all the Black Mountain bands and attachments.  I feel my new bands will help me take my work-outs to a higher level, which is why I chose Black Mountain.  I'm impressed so far.  In the future, when I need other exercise related equipment, I&#8217;ll definitely consider buying from Black Mountain Products!",5.0,Love my Black Mountain resistance bands!,1374451200,"07 22, 2013",Sports_and_Outdoors,1.0

Many reviewers wrote that this stackable set is good for P90X but I have to agree with the few people who said it wasn't so great for this purpose.The quality of the bands seems very good and I'd give the product 5 stars for quality. The problem I have with these is that in order to make these stackable, the connection adds about 6"" between your hand and the beginning of the band in comparison to other bands. Compare the pictures here to those for the strong man set.Some strength exercises in P90X have the weight moving very close to the ground. With the extra 6"" added, you can't get nearly that same range of motion doing it as instructed and I can't change my body position enough in order to create that range of motion while doing the exercise properly. Maybe this is because I am short but you can watch the P90X video and see that even with the bands that they use, the person using the bands can't really do the exercises as properly as the people using the weights. If anyone wants to comment on this review to disagree, I'll read what you have to say and edit this entry to reflect if I am swayed.The stacking function, though, is helpful. I am 120 pounds and can only do maybe 7 pullups - hence the need to be doing P90X! But I have to stack the three strongest bands in this set to get what I feel is comparable resistance to a real pullup. On the strong man set, you'd have to hold two or three handles in each hand to get the same resistance so this set is easier to use.",3.0,Not good for P90X in my opinion,1329955200,"02 23, 2012",Sports_and_Outdoors,0.0

They'll send you a new one--FAST AND FREE.- They get the job done if you're using them right; great results.- Comfy handles.- Ankle and door straps are great bonuses, along with the carrying bag.- Easy to travel with; lightweight and they fit anywhere.Cons:- Band could get in the way on some exercises.- A little too much slack between the handles and clips on the bands; removes resistance.- Doing some exercises with the bands could be a bit of a hassle; needing to extend your legs or arms awkwardly.Other Notes: My experience using the bands has been limited to P90X, but considering P90X covers just about every kind of common exercise I think it's safe to say I've put these bands through a good test. I've had to get the red band replaced twice so far in 4 months. The first time I noticed a rip, and the second time the metal clasp broke off and hurt me quite bad during the 'box lifting' exercise. However, the second time was most likely my fault; I shouldn't have put THAT much tension on it. I sent them an E-mail both times and got a response the next day with my replacement bands arriving just 3 days later; the quick and kind costumer service made up for my minor injury (metal clasp shot my side and left a bruise).

The exercises call for some equipment to be utilized. If you lack that equipment, the program shows those preforming the exercises utilizing alternative methods to complete the routine. I thought it would be nice to mix up the different methods for something different.REVIEW:The purchased showed up with everything included in the photo. There was the carrying case, an instruction manual that was brief but explained what the combination of colors would add up to, an ankle/soft grip strap, and a door anchor.The resistant bands are of a higher quality. I tried out the resistant bands in the store and felt that the material making up the bands including the clips were very cheap. These feel durable and have held up quite well through vigorous usage during this second round of P90X.I know it states one size fits all. Myself, I am 5'8, these bands are perfect. If you are shorter and have slack, you are able to adjust. If you are a taller male, you might have some issues preforming the exercises to their full extend since they will not stretch the distance you need them to.PRO:++ Durable material. Built to last++ Includes everything needed in one set up plus extras to complete exercise routines++ Great for any exercise routine as well as physical therapy if lifting weights is too great but need natural resistanceCON:++ Only one set of handles included.

If you are looking to really build you body up with an inexpensive, well made, extremely effective product, these bands are awesome. So, A few years ago I basically completed the P90 transformation program that was the predecessor to the P90X program. Instead of using weights I used bands and became an instant believer in their ability to build muscle. Now, fast forward a few years, I recently was given the opportunity to do the P90X program with a few friends as a competition with accountability so we will all finish the program at the same time. I got them all convinced that bands are the best way to go and we recently received our B.M.P. product bands in the mail. Below is what I think about the bands.1. First, Shipping was great. The bands came well packaged, on time, and were stamped with ""Priority"" and ""Take special Care"" stickers.2. The bands themselves are intense. As I mentioned, I have used bands in the past. The biggest problem is getting enough tension on the bands for various exercises. However, this set of bands basically trumps those worries completely. I am an in shape guy, and if I use all five bands at once, I can barely get them all up. The set of 5 gives PLENTY of resistance for any type of workout your going to be using.3. I did a lot of research before getting these and I really think you will be stoked about buying them. The materials are really heavy duty. I put these bands through some serious stretch and they are working tremendously.Hope this review helps, Like I said, I convinced the guys Im working with to get bands as well and they are just as stoked. Its funny to see them switch from weights to bands because they used to make fun of me for using the bands.... until they tried them. Now they realize how intense they are.

So far it's held, but it feels flimsy.I would prefer the rings on the foam handles were a little bit larger, in case i want to double up more bands and have them all on a single handle (So you could be hooking up more than 5 rings at the same time.Overall they are getting a lot of use, and eventually they will wear down, but the price is good enough that it's worth going through a new set, even every few months.

If you have a door that opens up to a larger space or hallway, you can do a lot of the exercises. If you live in an apartment you will sometimes not have enough room to stretch out as walls tend to get in the way. What I like about this set is that you can tack on as many or as little or mix and match the bands according to your level of expertise and strength. You can actually do more that what it says you can do in the workout booklet provided. If you have gone to the gym before and have worked out with free weights, you will be able to duplicate some of those exercises as well. Just use a little imagination and what you have at home, like a chair, a wall, etc. The padding on the grip is adequate. I can see it just not lasting too long if you use it everyday.

I played multiple sports all through high school, and while I don't play sports here in college I have always kept myself pretty fit by training for and running marathons, lifting weights a couple times a week, and participating in intramurals.However, despite my history I have never really used resistance bands before but after talking with some of my friends, I decided to buy a set of resistance bands for use while traveling and on the days that I didn't feel like going to the gym. I bought this Black Mountain Resistance Band Set last week and after a week of use I have decided that resistance bands are my new favorite thing. You can do so many exercises and still get a great workout without all the hassel of going to a gym / buying weights to use in the home.That being said, given my relative inexperience I feel like this resistance band set is a great product for the amount of money that you are paying. For $25 you get 5 resistance bands in varying degrees of resistance and two handles that clip onto the ends of the bands. The bands themselves seem to be sturdy and well made, and the clips as well. It also comes with a door and a ankle mount and a good carrying bag to keep it all together. When everything is in the bag it is small enough that it could fit comfortably in a suitcase, which I appreciated since I travel a lot for recruiting and for my job while in college.All in all, seems like a great buy.

I travel quite a bit and take these bad boys along with me wherever I go. When the weather is bad, I default to my bands and get the exercise that I need. My only concern is the length of the bands. They are very short for certain exercises and you do not get the full extension needed for a workout. Quality is ok and they fit easily into a carry-on.Now for my thoughts on the Black Mountain Products company. Its concerning that they sell this set on Amazon directly from Black Mountain but they are $3.00 more than their own website. Plus they provide free shipping. Since they are the same product from the same company, why not charge the same price? Go figure.

Simon,"[3, 5]","I waited several months to write the review so I could talk about the product over a longer period other than just the first use.Like most people I use the bands for P90X and they work great. When I started the program I was using dumbells and the bands are much better. My results per workout are almost twofold with the bands, since the resistance provides an isometric workout. These bands also give you more flexibility in terms of how much weight/resistance you want compared to the P90X bands.I had 2 concerns when I first purchased them:(1) My workout room gets extremely hot during the summer and I was worried that it would affect the band's elasticity. I've had them all summer and so far I haven't seen any signs of degredation due to the heat.(2) The description of the product has the max weight equivalent as 35 lbs with the red bands, I was worried this wouldn't be high enough for me. However this proved to be an unfounded fear, since when you hold the bands on the muscle contraction it increases the workout exponentially (much more difficult than dumbells)There are two concerns I still have however:(1) For P90X some of the workouts require you to step on the bands. If you are mixing two bands for increased weight it is incredibly difficult to find a good balance for both bands on both arms. In this situation one arm will experience more resistance than the other.(2) My sneakers have tiny, soft rubber, spike shaped treads on arch (maybe only 1/16 of an inch or less in diameter). When I stepped on one of the bands with the arch of my foot I noticed the band got several pinholes from the treads. This worries me because I'm afraid thif at over time these pin holes will grow and one day the bands might break. None of the other bands have this issue since I didn't use the arch of my foot for them, so I recommend that you don't use shoes with miniature spike like treads on them when stepping on the bands.The door latch works perfectly too, doesn't slip out at all like someone people have had concerns about. I haven't used the ankle brace yet.I recommend using gloves with the bands for shoulder press and tricep exercises, as the cloth on the handles will rub against the back side of your hands.Its the perfect price, I used the free super saver shipping, Amazon said 5-8 business days, it came in two.

The foam around the handles is comfortable to hold. The information that comes with the bands helps to determine which combination you need for the amount of resistance you're looking for. I'm using them in conjunction with P90X and they're working out very very well.The only thing I have had any issues with is the area where the caribiner/clip is attached to the handle is slightly abrasive and rubs my arms during some of the exercises. It's not breaking the skin or causing any lasting scrapes, but it's not the most comfortable feeling in the world. My only other (totally superficial) complaint is that my storage bag ripped the second time I took the bands out. The seam seemed to be held together with adhesive rather than being stitched.

Several weeks later I popped 2 others.I went to Amazon and looked up other bands and came across these.  I read many good reviews on them so I gave it a whirl.  I am so glad I did.

His doctor advised against heavy weights at his age  (can damage the bone growth and keep your smaller kid small if the growth plate hasn't fused shut yet. Anyhow, the doctor said that resistance bands can still help him bulk up like he wants WITHOUT inhibiting his growth. Yippie!!! SOOO, I started searching for made in the USA resistance bands. Trouble is, there's a catch. Resistance bands are made from rubber from a rubber tree which isn't indigenous to the US. I called and spoke to the owner (two brothers own and run this company, no pesky automated phone line or overseas language barriers to deal with when I called!). These are indeed assembled by hand by the owners in the US but because the rubber comes from Malaysia, they can't call it ""Made in USA"". Grin, but I can. These arrived in two days thanks to the wonders of Amazon Prime and I was VERY impressed with the density andGREAT quality of the bands and ankle strap. You can't beat the price either (I found everything else to be more expensive through Amazon and other sports stores).

I am a 20 year old, 5'9"", 145lb, Biomedical Engineering and Pre-Med student at my university, and tend to use exercise as a way to relieve stress and get my mind off of my highly intensive workload. As such, I frequent my campus gym very regularly, be it to lift, squat, run, row, or swim. Additionally, I am the COO of my school's Krav Maga club, and recently started practicing Tae Kwon Do. As such, I like to think of myself as being quite physically fit.I started looking into my own set of resistance bands a little while back, in the hopes that I would be able to add some more variety to my warm ups, stretches, and workouts. More importantly, I wanted something I could use in my dorm room or hallway that didn't make much noise and didn't take up much space (it is a dorm room, after all). They also had to be low maintenance and quick to use (whenever I pull an all-nighter or just a late night, I try to do something active every hour or so to prevent myself from going crazy or falling asleep). That's how I stumbled across these resistance bands on Amazon.Let's start with the pros. (I have only had these for a week or so, and as such, can't comment on the longevity of the bands. I will try to update this review when I can say more on the matter.1) Quality make. Each band is securely attached to a metal carabiner at both ends, and can be easily attached or removed from the handles to increase/reduce resistance. Other than the foam covered plastic handle, everything is comprised of quality rubber, metal, or durable fabric.2) Compact and easily organized. The bands come together in a little black drawstring bag, which is small and lightweight enough to simply toss in my gym bag before heading to practice or the weight room.3) Attractive. I know it might be weird to say this about what are basically big elastic bands, but the set is nice to look at. Black and metal, with the individually colored bands. I have had friends comment on how 'sweet' they looked (they liked using them as well).4) So so so easy to use. Again, these are big pieces of elastic attached to handles. While I'm sure someone can figure out a way to hurt themselves with these, it's not easy, and the variety of exercises one can do with these is fantastic. (The kit comes with a little paper booklet with some basic exercises, which is a nice touch). The door anchor and leg strap are pretty self-explanatory, and offer even more options for workouts. It's also nice to be able to combine bands to increase resistance, though if you do it with ALL the bands it can get a little crowded (though that hasn't stopped me)Now is the time I would normally talk about the dreaded cons, but frankly, there aren't any to note of (as of yet. I'll try to update this in a couple months). If someone insisted I complain about something, I would just say that the handles seem to be the component of cheapest quality, but that's only because the rest of the set is so nice.One thing it would be nice to see in the future would be a pair of fabric loops, for attaching to a bench press bar (for resistive sets). The handles work fine, but the rigid nature of them means that the bar digs into the handle when attached, which might reduce their lifespan. Also, this is just me, but I don't really see myself using the 2-4lb yellow band for anything, and would much rather have a second red or black band for extra heavy resistance.In conclusion: Yes, I would buy this again. Yes, I would recommend it to a friend (already have, and I'm going to take them to Krav Maga tonight to see if anyone else is interested). Five stars, and I will most certainly be looking at more of B.M.P's gear in the future. One other thing to note would be that my set came with a free orange resistance band coupon, which is supposedly even more resistant then the red 'extra heavy' band. The gentleman on the other end of the phone was very friendly, and I look forward to receiving it. I would have rather had this orange band included in place of the yellow band, but that's not something to complain about.",5.0,Excellent product at a very reasonable price.,1360195200,"02 7, 2013",Sports_and_Outdoors,1.0

That is, the nylon fabric is doubled back on itself and sewn, creating a loop.  I think it would be easier to use if a D-ring, such as used in the ankle cuff, were sewn into the door anchor.

I spoke with the owner Dan Weidner pertaining to some questions about the bands and the man is an absolute professional. He was very polite and answered all my questions and told me I could contact him anytime. He sincerely wanted me to feel happy with my purchase.I'm a 55 year old man with several medical conditions that now prevent me from work. I'm on social security disability due to a 38 year chronic back condition, 13 years of fibromyalgia and recently diagnosed with several bulging degenerative discs. This has resulted in several misaligned discs causing me multi-level bi-lateral foraminal stenosis of the spine. I have moderate to severe numbness in both my legs. Since I was a teenager, I have done some form of exercise, swimming, running, bodybuilding, elliptical and Nordic Track. It is only after I turned 52 that I really began to have major medical problems due to the combination of the above. I lost the ability to lift weights which has always been my physical therapy. I need to keep active and keep my muscles active and strong to support my spine and reduce the muscles spasms caused by Fibromyalgia.I thought I'd give these resistance bands a try and I couldn't be more satisfied customer. I have been lifting weights for 35 years but can't use them anymore, that is, unless I want to end up in the emergency room. These bands are very easy to use. I find them to work my muscles better than weights and weight machines because they stretch the muscle throughout the movement, really great for my Fibromyalgia condition. Of course you should use the appropriate band(s) and do the exercise fluidly and slow, no jerking or relaxing upon completion of the movement to get the full effect. These bands remind me of the bands I used for swimming team practice.I would recommend purchasing these resistance bands sold by BLACK MOUNTAIN as they are well worth the money. Take this review from someone who has been into fitness for most of his life and who has used a variety of gym equipment; and if you have a muscular/neurological conditions like me than these are for you.The bands are well made and the hand grips are very comfortable.I've altered several exercises in the manual to fit my condition and added a few of my own as follows.SEATED ROW - IX and XIVPlace door anchor about 18 inches above floor.Put resistance bands into door anchorSit down on floor with legs flat on floor at a 45 degree angle facing door (opposite angle from door anchor.)TRICEP EXTENSION - IIIPlace door anchor in top middle of door.Put resistance bands into door anchorPush down and back with BOTH hands bending at the elbow.LAT PULL DOWN - XIII (standing as in instructions does not work for me)Place door anchor in top middle of door.Put resistance bands into door anchorSit with back against door and legs straight out on floor.Pull resistance bands straight down to where handle is parallel to shoulder.(This gives better support for my back and allowing for a better stretch).The following are exercises not in instruction booklet.SITTING LAT CHEST PULLDOWN(This builds lats in upper back and intercostal rib cage muscles.)Place door anchor in top middle of door.Put resistance bands into door anchorSit with back against door and legs straight out on floor.Keeping arms fully extended, pull resistance bands straight down (palms facing floor) to 12 to 18 inches above knee.FOREARM CURL(This is similar to exercise V the curl but builds forearm muscles instead of bicep.)Place band under feet.Curl band with palms facing down towards floor, instead of palms up as in bicep curl.FORWARD LATERAL RAISE(This is similar to exercise VI side lateral raise but gets deltoids at a different angle.)Place both feet over center of band.Keeping arms straight, raise arms forward and over head.",5.0,One of the best investments that I've ever made,1370736000,"06 9, 2013",Sports_and_Outdoors,1.0

Some people may need more weight than this set can provide.  Since my wife did not use the &#34;heaviest&#34; red band very often, I borrowed hers to make my simulate pull-ups more challenging.The door strap works well near a hinge, and these bands also worked well over a pull up bar.  Overall they have held up fairly well.The Bad:Out of our two sets, one strap broke at the metal clasp.  I expected one of the rubber tubes to give out, but instead the metal snapped where the clip swivels around on the post that attaches to the band.  Fortunately no one was hurt when it went, but it left a mark on the top of the door frame when it went during a pull-up.Some of the bands show a lot of wear from friction when standing on the band to shorten it or to increase tension, as the P90X videos demonstrate.  Again, none of them have snapped, but we stopped using one of the black bands just in case.Overall:I liked the bands to get started on P90X, but ultimately decided they weren't giving me the workout I wanted.

When we need to anchor to a door, we use my anchor which uses a donut ring instead and holds without slipping.

I've been using it for a month now for my T25 workouts and it's been great.  The construction quality is good and the bands work very well and I don't have any concerns with them breaking. The included exercise booklet is great and the different attachments it includes help you do a variety of workouts. I did learn a few things while using them that people might want to know.1. Even though there are multiple included bands that allow you to do different weight combinations (great feature), it takes time to attach the bands to the handles, and sometimes I don't feel the effort to un-attach and attach the bands. This gets emphasized on the T25 workouts due to the fact that the workouts are fast paced, I don't want to stop and spend a few min swapping bands. I am looking to get http://amzn.to/1b8DJ67 which will allow me to at least have 2 different weights and I can change dynamically in my workout.2. The exercise booklet is great for doing different exercises and I think people would be very happy with doing that and having that variety. I mainly purchased these bands for T25 and I realized when I got into it that T25 even though they support resistance bands, the muscle and workouts they do are better suited for dumbbells, like weighted squats don't work very well with resistance bands due to resistance is hard to get on a down motion of a squat. This isn't a ding on the product, just a realization that dumbbells do have their place if the workouts a video does is based around them. It isn't enough of an issue for me to want to crowd my living room with dumbbells though.Overall I'm very happy. The price point is ridiculous for this kind of quality. Look elsewhere, and you find a single band for $15-20.  Even them selling the handles alone cost $10.

I don't have much to which I can compare them but they certainly appear to be very good quality on their own.  I've been using them in concert with Tony Horton's Power 90 program and find them to be perfect.It is very easy to connect/disconnect them from the handles which brings me to one of the things I like A LOT about them.  I had started by using the Green (10-12 pound) band.  Then I got to the point where I really needed to move onto the next (Black - 15-20 pound) band for most of the exercises (but not quite all).  Rather than move onto the Black I simply combine the Green I had been using with the Blue (4-6 pound) band.  Then for the ones for which I need the lighter weight I simply and quickly disconnect only one side of the Blue and I'm back to Green.  It works great and the speed of the change allows me to keep up with the program without pausing.I'm very happy with this product!,5.0,Very Very Happy,1363478400,"03 17, 2013",Sports_and_Outdoors,1.0

More importantly, BMP stands firmly behind them:  while I have only used them for a couple of days, the bands come with a 90 day satisfaction guarantee, which matches perfectly with the length of this program.Overall, the service has the feel of a company that wants you to come back, which makes for a product with which I am extremely comfortable.",5.0,Excellent quality for price,1296691200,"02 3, 2011",Sports_and_Outdoors,1.0

Being a personal trainer it's always a perk to be able to toss all those band types into one bag when traveling to multiple client's houses throughout the day. My only complaint is the tension/shortness of the bands. While they do stretch fine for moves like an overhead press the bands are very tight which makes each band's weight resistance not accurate when doing these moves. This can be a bit of a problem for some of my lady and elderly clients who use the 2-4lb or 6-8lb for almost all moves and then struggle immensely when shifting to a press move or tri-extension which stretches the band to its limits.,4.0,Great bands!,1362355200,"03 4, 2013",Sports_and_Outdoors,1.0

Even at the sale price, it turned out to be a waste of money!First, the bar ends that rest against the door frame are hard plastic, not foam pads like on the Iron Gym.  The hard plastic ends will almost certainly damage a wooden frame. Heck, even the Iron Gym's foam pads eventually wore through the frame's paint, so I have no doubt that this model will do worse.Second, the bolts that connect the top cross-bar are not recessed into the bar like they are on the Iron Gym.  In fact, on this model, the bolt heads stick out further than the rubber pad that is supposed to protect the wall!  These bolt heads will definitely leave marks on the wall above your door frame.Third, the handles are straight, not angled as shown in the product picture.  This probably ticks me off more than the above problems, as I wanted the angled grip for wide pull-ups, and this was one of the reasons I chose this over another Iron Gym bar.Fourth, this uses very thin bolts compared to the ones on the Iron Gym, and they are not plated like the Iron Gym's.  I bet these will rust quickly.So, bottom line is this is an inferior design and doesn't come as advertised. It only cost me an Andrew Jackson so it's not worth sending back, but I recommend you shop around and compare the build quality before buying.  Note that most of the others that look the same probably are - look closely at the pictures and compare the bar ends that rest against the frame.

I bought these bands because I wanted a resistance band that I could quickly adjust (which equates to quicker/efficient workouts!).  The clips are strong and the nylon that bridges the band with the clip is durable.  The bands themselves are infinitely better quality than anything you'll find in a local store, yet at a fraction of the price.  I do own a pair of the Lifeline TNT cables, so as an unbiased customer, I owe it to the community to make comparisons.  The main difference between the Lifeline TNT cables and the Saber Bands is the quality of the band itself.  In terms of durability, the Lifeline TNT cables are ""available by prescription only"" while the Saber Bands are the ""extra strength over-the-counter medication"".  If you are a gym-rat meathead that bench presses 300 lbs as a warm-up set, then the Saber Cables doesn't provide the 100-pound cable that you would need.  If you are anyone else, the Saber Bands will be more than enough.  I think the Saber Bands beat out the TNT cables on many levels: (1) you aren't limited by only 3 cables, (2) adjusting the resistance is a cinch (if you have 1 cable on the TNT handles and want to add one more, you have to detach the 1 cable then re-attach 2 cables), (3) it's much lighter and less bulky, making it ideal for travel/outdoor training, and (4) it is more than decently priced (I feel like I'm ripping off the seller for once!).

The problem I have is with the door anchor.  There is a small plastic cylinder inside the anchor side of the door anchor that is supposed to prevent the door anchor from coming through the door.  The first time I used it, this plastic piece broke, which allowed the anchor to become much flatter which then allowed it to squeeze through the door.  I have to admit, this was an internal hollow core lightweight door that does not lock or secure very well.  When the plastic piece broke it also jarred the door allowing the latch to open, the anchor then shot forward and smacked me very hard in the center of my back.  I posted a picture as well.

Very high quality bands, I've used them inside (70 degrees) and outside (50 degrees) and they've held up in both places. All of the handles, clips, nylon straps, and other parts of the band are in excellent condition. Further, even though these bands are automotive-grade, they rubber is virtually odor free, and this isn't the case with all exercise bands.It's a nice plus to these bands that the handles detach. It adds more variability and flexibility as to what one can do with the bands. Also, the bands are indeed the resistance weights that are advertised, and I have found that they offer plenty of resistance. I'm an avid athlete who is just a year out of playing at the collegiate level, I know my way around a gym,  and I use free weights, 5lb-45lb. These bands completely cover that, they are very light-weight and easily transportable, and if you want to start using bands or are looking for a durable set, these are the ones. (Note: resistance bands are known for providing strength training that increases muscle tone, range of motion, and flexibility. They are great for providing functional workouts, and they can be used for building some muscle size, but if you're a bigger guy wanting to get bulked, resistance bands may not be for you. For anyone else, they do the trick and can't be beat for convenience.)Saber is a good company, they're a family-owned business, and when you call them, you don't get an answering machine, automatic response, or a customer service rep who doesn't care, you get the owner.

Most of the resistance bands in the campus gym are fixed to a specific handle - you can't compound them to increase the resistance. With these bands, though, it's easy to create precisely the correct amount of resistance by mixing combinations from just a few bands. The handles are also surprisingly comfortable - more than I thought they'd be. The bands themselves also seem very durable and unlikely to age quickly.The door anchor is sufficient for its purpose, though you do have to physically remove the handles from the bands in order to slide it on and off (of course, this is better than having the ""clipping mechanism"" some door anchors use, which almost invariably wear out and break). If you use the door anchor for pull-downs, though, you're probably using a lot more weight than you would for other exercises, so switching in and out of ""door mode"" usually requires removing the handles to change the bands anyway. Still, if the loop in the anchor were wide enough to pull the handle through, the issue would be averted entirely.I don't usually use bands over weights, but I wanted to try them mostly as a travel-friendly alternative. They certainly fit that purpose well, especially with the bag which they give you. All together, they don't take up much room in a suitcase, and even then it's unlikely that you'd need to take all five bands with you anyway.There was one small issue, however. The blue band had a few small spots of green rubber fused to the side (almost like the raised edge of a plastic figure that was cast in a mold - a sort of continuation of the rubber that didn't fit the rest of the figure). When I mentioned this to customer service, they profusely apologized and promised to send a replacement immediately. I can't say I mind, though - the band works just fine, and you wouldn't have noticed unless you were looking for that one spot.",5.0,Excellent piece of equipment.,1288051200,"10 26, 2010",Sports_and_Outdoors,1.0

If you screw the bolt of the wheel tightly against the backboard, the spinning wheel comes to an abrupt halt after you spin it, instead of slowly rolling to a gradual stop like the wheels you see at carnivals. That takes away the fun and excitement of participants who would otherwise watch the wheel slowing down as they hope it stops on their prize (or number). Conversely, if you screw the bolt in too loose the wheel becomes all wobbly, causing it to bang against the backboard and affecting the turning of the wheel so that it's spin seems unnatural, the last thing you want in a game with any kind of prizes where people might wonder if it's somehow rigged. The dry-erase surface is a bit odd and hard to make look professional when you're just using dry-erse markers unless you have perfect handwriting. The manufacturer says to email them if you want to find out where to get pre-fitted word documents that you can customize, but I emailed them and didn't get a reply. I don't see how cut up word documents would fit on the wheel without tape or glue so I didn't pursue it. And yes it's relatively easy to assemble even without instructions, but for this kind of money the least they should do is include some type of written directions so you wouldn't have to do it by trial and error. Also, one of the four corner pads on the bottom of the base was missing, so I took the other three off to make it level. Overall it seems sturdy but even so, it is way overpriced.

I took one star off for no liner installed for the tire rim. This is important as some of the rough edges were not fully sanded down where the spoke holes were drilled. Easy to fix before inflating the inner tube. Battery bag is just the right size for large capacity 12v SLA. I went with an 18AH model. Battery bag could be improved with the addition of a carrying strap to make taking the bag indoors easier given the weight of SLA batteries for charging purposes and protecting from temperature extremes or theft. The battery power lines are not labeled as indicated in the instruction manual. There was a warning in the book that the warranty would be invalidated if user hooked up wrong. Since the wires aren't labeled I could hardly see how the end user would be at fault if one did mix up the polarity as there is no real way to test which is which.

Like many ardent fans, I've wanted a pulse rifle ever since seeing the movie Aliens. I'm also an avid gamer, and in such obvious favorites as Alien Trilogy, Alien vs. Predator for the Atari Jaguar, and Aliens vs. Predator for the PC, the pulse rifle is the standby weapon, making actually owning one that much sweeter.Until recently, the only commercially available pulse rifles have been the Icons resin replica for over half a grand, or various moving-part offerings from a few small production companies in the thousand-dollar-plus range. Considering what you'd pay for just a chunk of resin with some paint thrown at it, the Matrix AEG Pulse Rifle is a ridiculous bargain, all the way around. Actual working parts? Check. Real metal construction? Check. Authentic firearm weight and heft? Fully functional LCD ammo counter? Actually SHOOTS?! Check, check, and check! This gun looks fantastic, has actual moving and functional parts to play with, and is a blast to shoot.

The first gripes are about authenticity. There is a shotgun shell instead of a grenade in the under-barrel pump assembly. It's not visible unless you slide the pump grip back, but it's not authentic. Also, ""Made in China"" is printed conspicuously on the side of the gun, instead of one of the dozen less obvious places it could have gone. It would have been nice if the magazine was incorporated into the magazine cap. The orange barrel caps are required by law in many places. If it's legal to bypass this requirement (check local laws), I recommend painting over rather than removing them. They're securely glued on, and I have yet to see a photo of a clean removal job online. There are other minor authenticity complaints, but for how good this product looks for the price, your best bet would be to buy it and make your own modifications if you really feel the need. I'm very happy with mine, ""as is"".The other gripes regard quality control, and they are mostly legitimate. You will need a better battery. I ended up exchanging my first pulse rifle because of a bad battery and broken LCD counter switch, right out of the box. The battery in my second unit was good, but not strong enough to cycle the piston until it was loosened up first by a higher amperage battery. You will also want to buy a ""smart"" charger, as these batteries are notoriously easy to overcharge--thus killing them. The edges of the retractable stock will scratch down to bare metal after only a few slides back and forth. The magazine is a real pain to line up correctly and insert (though internal shimming might help this). Other reported problems include scratches, cracks in the plastic, and loose internal screws. While there have been complaints about the shroud (carrying handle) being flimsy and breaking, I think that this could occur during run-and-gun games, but not during normal target shooting and handling. Others have reported loose pistol grips and pump action slides, and I did notice that both of these were tighter on the replacement pulse rifle I ended up with (but were acceptable on the first gun). I don't believe I've ever purchased a product with so many known issues (though not all justified), and I specifically bought from Amazon rather than cheaper vendors elsewhere in case I needed an exchange. Good thing I did, too, and the vendor (Access Store) was absolutely outstanding in quickly handling the return in the most convenient way possible, at no cost to me.""Remember--short, controlled bursts."" -- Most of the other reviews I've read have been by individuals that bought this first as a pulse rifle collectible, and second as an Airsoft gun. I'm in the same category, although I have experience with traditional airguns and firearms. If you're just looking for an Airsoft rifle for games or target shooting, you can find more reliable and easier to use products for less, elsewhere. In particular, the pulse rifle handles awkwardly compared to more traditional firearms, has no built in sights, and the magazine is hard to line up right and swap out. However, as a pulse rifle collectible that also actually shoots, this gun is a blast. Aiming down the groove in the carrying handle is not very precise and takes some getting used to, though the large groove does afford a good view of your BBs streaking away toward the target. I had no firing problems in either single or full auto mode. Velocity is reportedly good for an Airsoft rifle (close to 400 fps), and after some target shooting (the accuracy is reasonable for an Airsoft rifle), had fun shredding some aluminum cans.IMPORTANT NOTES:--Even with a higher amperage battery, my gun's piston would not cycle until I switched it to full auto. I had no sticking problems in either mode after that. Once the piston was apparently un-stuck, the included stock battery could power it--but not before. Again, you will need a better battery--and a smart charger. The manual provides no charging instructions whatsoever, but if you stick with the stock parts, figure the charging time in hours by dividing the mA (milliamps) of the battery by the output of the charger (1100 mA battery divided by 350 mA charger output = 3.1 hours for a full charge, for what was included with mine).--The manual is terrible, unless you're already used to brown-box Chinese products that come with little or no product information. I've literally seen more thorough product instructions on bubble gum. In case you're wondering why it continually warns against disassembling your gun, while showing you in detail exactly how to take it completely apart, it's because this manual originally came with a parts kit that you could use to modify a Thompson M1A1 Airsoft gun into a pulse rifle. (The parts kit alone originally sold for more than the complete rifle here, again making this quite the bargain.)--Note that the magazine capacity is actually 190 rounds, not the 60 or 70 listed (the manual can't even agree with itself). Also, in case you're new to Airsoft, you fill a high capacity magazine by pouring BBs through the small pop-open hatch on the top, and then fully wind the geared wheel on the bottom of the magazine until it starts making a different clicking sound--this usually takes about half a minute or so. You don't use a ""charging rod"" to load the included clip as the manual confusingly states. This may be obvious to experienced shooters, but for a first-time purchaser the manual again fails miserably.--Use only seamless, high quality 6mm BBs. There are several available weights, and the manufacturer recommends 0.23g BBs. This will prevent jamming, feeding and other ammo problems.""Marines, we are leaving!"" -- In conclusion, despite some possible issues, the Matrix AEG Pulse Rifle is an Aliens fan's dream, at a very reasonable price. I had to get an exchange to end up with a perfect unit (which is why I dock one star), but I still consider it well worth the trouble. I will probably only shoot mine on an occasional basis, and display it the rest of the time, but even if it never fires another shot, this particular Aliens fan is extremely pleased with his purchase.UPDATE -- I recently purchased a chronograph and wanted to drop some velocity figures in here. Running about 80 rounds (0.23 g Goldenball) through a Shooting Chrony Beta Master gave me an average of 351 fps with a 1600 mA battery, with no statistically significant difference between the stock 1100 mA battery (though firing rate was clearly slower in the latter) or between single shot and full auto modes; overall variation for all my tests was only around 3 fps. This velocity is close to what I would expect, considering that the advertised velocity was undoubtedly obtained with a lighter BB (which you want to avoid to prevent possible jams).",4.0,"Hey, I want to introduce you to a personal friend of mine",1381017600,"10 6, 2013",Sports_and_Outdoors,1.0

I've been a fan of the movie ""Aliens"" ever since it came out and my dad brought me to watch it in the theater. I was about 7 or 8 years old. Yeah, I nearly crapped my pants, but eventually loved the movie and the whole franchise, to include ""Predator"", ""Aliens vs. Predator"" and all the other movies and even comic books. Even today, with flicks like ""Prometheus"", the story continues to unfold and has almost become its own genre.This replica is a nice homage to that...and its a limited edition (although also available from Snow Wolf, see below), so what to do next is obvious for any die-hard fan of the Aliens franchise, or airsoft player who's also a fan. I no longer play airsoft, but I still had to have one of these. I found it on sale later somewhere else, but I'm happy with Amazon's service and I'm glad I went this route. Amazon's, and the seller's, buyer protection/returns policies are great. Turns out, I needed it.Because it is Chinese-made, I expected a few quality control issues. This is called a ""custom"" replica made by Matrix (under Evike), but I believe this is the exact same Pulse Rifle made by Snow Wolf, who makes decent AEG's even though they are a Chinese company. This is (probably) just the re-branded Matrix version. The bad reputation China has had for quality control is slowly but steadily moving out the door, and some of the best items are from there. Some of the Chinese airsoft brands are actually pretty great in quality, along with the Taiwanese brands. That being said, I still don't trust Chinese brands I don't have experience with, like this one.So when I first received it, I was hugely disappointed and there were some issues I just could not accept since this was intended as a collectible. The seller was extremely helpful though, and replaced it for free. After a few very helpful emails from them and putting it right back in the box it came in, it was in the mail.The issues were what someone who intends to use this for airsoft games would consider ""minor"". But for a collector, they were hard to ignore. It may have been shipping damage, since the gun ships with almost no padding at all, but it seemed more like quality control issues. The upper black receiver had a few small scratches in weird places under the stock but they were down to the bare metal. I'm fine with that if I was the one making all the scratches, but this is supposed to be brand new. The pump for the mock grenade launcher was very ""loose"" and didn't stay shut, but that wasn't that big of a deal. The pistol grip felt loose and the plastic creaked if you picked it up by the grip. It was covered in white or yellow dust and to top it all off, a small black Phillips screw fell out of the mag well as soon as I opened it. I heard it rattling around before I even opened the box...but it wasn't just a BB, like I hoped. I wasn't sure if all of them came like this from the factory, but the seller agreed to send another just in case. (THANK YOU AGAIN!)That loose screw could've been nothing, or left-over from the factory, but it could also be something pretty important. Like off of the gear box or other internals. I just put it back in the magwell and packed it all up immediately, deciding not to take a chance. If I was going to run around playing airsoft in the woods with it, I probably wouldn't care...but I have a G&G; F2000 if I ever felt like doing that. As a collectors item, I want my pulse rifle to be as close to perfect as possible, and have everything attached.The second Pulse Rifle arrived:...in a lot better condition! But now I can see that they all have quality control issues. Some, more than others. This one looked fine though, and even felt a little more solid for some reason. The shotgun pump also stayed in place.Dust, still there but not as much. It must be from the factory, machining or packaging process. C'mon, Snow Wolf...invest in a vacuum cleaner?Scratches, not on the metal but on the plastic this time, but not too noticeable. As if someone took a car key and tossed it a few times at the gun. A few bigger gouges/scuffs...probably shipping damage. I can look past it. Its nothing you'd notice unless you were holding it up and inspecting it in sunlight.Overall, it looks a lot better and could pass for ""new"". I'm happy with the condition. There are no bright scratches on the metal parts. No loose screws! It even feels more solid and the shotgun pump stays put, although that part wasn't a big deal.Function - I'm not going to chrono this or give any field reports because that's all been done in many other reviews. To sum it up, this gun performs great on the field, if you intend it for that. It's based on the Marui Thompson. But I can also say...It needs a battery and smart charger - Definitely use a 9.6v battery (or more if you can fit it with modifications) and skip the 8.4v. The metal v6 gearbox should be able to handle it. The rate of fire is lower than I hoped for with a 8.4v 1600mah Tenergy battery. I don't even bother using the included battery. It's next to useless and they probably include it with the gun just for looks. A Pulse Rifle should sound like its ""pulsing"", not ""pop pop pop"". The good news is that any AEG is upgradable, and the 9.6v battery alone will make a difference...but for the true ""tinkerers"" out there, you can use a li-po battery for extreme rate of fire. Just learn li-po safety first, because they can explode, burn out your trigger, or catch on fire if mishandled...Appearance - Aside from the quality control issues, the gun itself is somewhat solidly constructed, and for a fan of Aliens, looks AMAZING! Except for the ""Made in China"" stamped on the side, but 100mph tape or paint could fix that. Not too much wobbles or creaks on the gun, except the grip. On the second gun I received, the grip seems tighter. This is something you can probably tighten yourself, but I don't expect wobbly grips right out of the box. This is a very front-heavy gun though, and the added stress can't help. But it's not too heavy overall or too unwieldy of a gun, even if its not even close to being balanced. But I am used to an 8-9lb F2000. This weighs a lot less of course, but it's no M4 carbine. The Pulse Rifle is not designed for comfort, it's designed for a movie set, and you don't use one for ergonomics. You use it for killin xeno's!Upgradeable - There's lots of info out there on possible mods for this gun. You could try installing an actual working airsoft grenade launcher or shotgun up front. Not to mention all the internal upgrades you can do, if inclined. To use a li-po, you should at least install a fuse or MOSFET. If you want to remove the orange tips, if its legal in your area, its going to be tough. You'll need a heat gun because they're glued on. Probably easier to just paint them black. Some also paint the grenade launcher portion to make it look more realistic. But then again, it's fine just the way it is.The bottom line is that it's now possible for any hobbyists out there to get their hands on this fine piece of memorabilia, stick it on a wall or something, plink soda cans in the back yard, or play some airsoft games at the local field....and it won't break the bank. I've seen them in other colors too, on other sites...tan and woodland camo. But this olive drab version is more true to the films. A long time ago, only the &uuml;ber-SCI-fi-fans had replicas and they were usually really expensive, made of resin or other non-metal material, and did nothing at all. Airsoft kits came out later, but weren't affordable or easy to find, either.This is a limited edition, according to Matrix. You could try getting the Snow Wolf version from another seller, maybe direct from HK or China. But, it will probably cost more, and be exactly the same...just maybe not the colors. If you're a fan of Aliens, enough to think that having a working (airsoft) Pulse Rifle around your house would be the COOLEST THING EVER...or if you're an airsoft player that wants to have something really different from everyone else...well then you'd better get one before they stop making them and they go up in price.

While building in Germany I used to use these Bahco hatchets for setting timber rafters and splitting kindling for Granny. There is not another hatchet being sold on Amazon that is of this quality in this price range. I brought two back to the USA in my luggage. Damn it! Can't do that any more.The metal has a very distinctive ring to it when chopping. The nice contoured radius edge is easy to maintain and sharpens up well with a few passes of a file. On the hatchets that I own the handles appear to be made of a tight grain beech. The hatchet overall tends to be a tad head heavy which I prefer for splitting wood. Let the tool do the work. I would say that these Bahco hatchets are lifetime tools. As in - they will last you your lifetime.Not really suited to be used as a belt hatchet and does not come with a sheath.Act now and buy two Bahco hatchets before those German wholesalers figure out that they can get more for this product.I've used mine for over 20 years and have only replaced the handle once.Don't waste your money on Fiskars and the China made hatchets.,5.0,Smokin' Deal!,1400112000,"05 15, 2014",Sports_and_Outdoors,1.0

For a $22.00 axe it looks and feels awesome. I will note, I can choke up all the way, and the handle feels good all around. The bare edge is coated with what I'm guessing is enamel. The head on mine is also stamped. It also comes with a little rubber blade cover that I think I'll hang onto to make a sheath with, and yes the wedge does have a loop or hanger, I think I'll cut mine off like Bensoutdoor since its broke anyways.***UPDATEThere are about two or three things you need to know before you buy this. 1. I bought this hatchet knowing it will break. Its a tool, its 20 dollars, and its not going to compete with the best in the industry. Why? you would be loosing money producing a tool and only charging $20 apiece from the time it takes to make a top notch tool... pretty cut and dry here...2. the paint on the handle will apparently blister your hand (according to old jimbo, axe expert), either stand, rub, scrape it off, get blisters, or wrap the handle3. Uh last but not least buy a $20 dollar tool expecting to own a tool worth $20... it won't hold and edge here lets be realistic people. For a reference please see wranglerstar's video 'Bahco axe update' on youtube, I didn't watch the whole thing, no offence, to anyone! I Don't have the time to watch his videos, I work 60 hours a week...  I bought this knowing what it is and plan on its ultimate destruction followed by a full refurbish. So my advice if you want an axe under 20$... don't. either buy a used head that you did some homework on, on ebay (I'm currently biding on many that have flushed in lately),or if you got the cash and, well there's no one stopping you, buy a nice one like a Roselli, a gransfors bruks, uhm... wetterlings...I would recommend Snow and Nealley but their heads appear to be made in china, and hults bruks got pretty good reviews from oldjimboold jimbo told me also a friend's of his axe started to chip at the edge, he said to keep filing away at it and it would be fine and it was. I also saw a picture of a wetterlings that chipped from hitting a knot in a tree... and uhm, well don't do that, unless you want an $80+ axe to chip...** One more thing old jimbo told me, let your axe handle season for a bit before traveling to the mountains with it, or it might split apparently. axe handles should be dried already, but there's a difference between wood that's been seasoned for 1 year, and one that's been seasoned for 3, to 7 years...for a reference on that one please see the book hunting with bow and arrow(its public domain meaning its free to download, goggle hunting with bow and arrow PDF) chapter 5, paragraph 17. that may be for making a bow, but my point is still the same, wood changes in time and depending on the moisture content in the air.if you don't know where to start:do yourself a huge favor and do what I did, watch dave canterbury's '21st Century Longhunter Axes, Hawks, and the Nesmuk Double bit' video on youtubeonce again, did not watch the whole thing... don't have time, just listened to the axe names and said, 'that's interesting'...or you could goggle carving axethen switch to image view and scroll down...pick one you want and read a bit about itmy fav looking ones are from:holtheathwoodentreenoutdoors.magazine.free Scandinavian Bowl Carving*if you just goggle those you should come up seeing the same images I did, sorry, can't post links on here...well that's about all I know. Do your homework before you buy and don't be afraid to try something out, remember you only buy a rolex if you can afford 2... I would recommend custom maker's and their axe's... like a blacksmith's but without knowledge and reviews of their axe's or their process's, well your taking a gamble for their expertise... that they didn't mess it up. Some people may be irritated at me for posting this much knowledge on amazon, but the way I see it amazon reviewer's who know more than me have been helping save me money for, 7 years now... including alternative names, pros, cons, where to look, what to do, useful information, and I owe em one.",5.0,Awesome!,1398124800,"04 22, 2014",Sports_and_Outdoors,1.0

The ideas and musical genius of this man are stunning. I, being a follower of more melodic pop and classical, loved some of the soft, melodic ideas he came up with. 'Kim', 'The toast', 'Shadow of the hierophant', 'spectral mornings', to name a few melodic, soft masterpieces.Cured I could just about accept, it had 'Cradle of Swans' which harked back to his earlier work and the last track 'Turn Back time' was a very melodic piece with nice harmonies, the rest was ok.This is something of a culture shock for me. Gone are any soft songs and tuneful tracks with different instruments and multi layered songs.

He had an aggressive sound that was uniquely Chicago. This fierce CD has captured that sound and feel. Although the disc was recorded in 1980, it has a '70s funk/blues sound. The nine energy-laced songs feature seven originals by Seals, and two covers - the more notable one by Cropper and Pickett. Most songs are up-tempo with hearty girth. As on Midnight Son, Seal's mighty five-piece core band is enlarged by a full brass section with sax, trumpet, and trombone. Chicago Fire closely resembles Midnight Son which was recently chosen among the Top 200 greatest guitar recordings of all time by GuitarOne Magazine.Buzzard Luck highlights the difficulties and challenges faced by Seals upon arriving in Chicago. Tragic lyrics like (""I can't kill nothing and won't nothing die"") paint a bleak picture. Flame-like horns musically drive the band and Seals, in particular, to extreme. I'm Not Tired is one of Seals most swinging numbers ever. Leaving Home contains an arrangement that Seals loved. It is also featured on Going Back Home from Midnight Son, and he used to use it on covers performed during his live sets. On the track, Seals' ferocious vocals are as haunting as King Solomon's bewitching organ. Landlord At My Door contains the definitive Son Seals sound that we now deeply miss. What is that sound? A deep, funk groove with lots of hefty blues layered on top pulsating horns with a guitar solo that effortlessly discharges notes and emotions. Like the disc's opening track, the song weighs the advantages and disadvantages of urban versus rural life. On Nobody Wants A Loser, Seals proclaims, (""the game of life is the hardest one to win"").

Part of this is due to having gone back to a band situation(featuring Nick Magnus and Marillion's Ian Mosely), while there's also a more 'progressive' element going as well. Highly Strung is also his last band/rock album with recurring themes and reprises, something which had charactarized some of his other earlier albums(Defector, Voyage Of The Acolyte) and also on such Genesis albums as Wind &amp; Wuthering. The track sequence is different from the original vinyl, so I'll give it one star less, as the original sequence was more effective. Here's the rundown: Camino Royale - A stage favorite which remains in Hackett's live set to this day. Nice interplay between guitars &amp; synthCell 151 - Great rock track with extended instrumental section at the end. I suppose this is very similar to his ex-bandmates' 'Abacab' song, in that it is a rock song with an extended jam starting halfway through the song.Always Somewhere Else - good instrumental which starts with a Hackett/Magnus guitar/acoustic piano duet which developes into an instrumental piece.Walking Through Walls - musically more in common with early 80's funk bands like Chic and Ray Parker JR. or 'You Dropped A Bomb On Me' than Genesis of old. A mild funk synth bass line dominates this, one of Steve's more offbeat yet accessable efforts.Give It Away - in contrast, this sounds very much like a lost GTR track, with its arena anthem-like guitar lines and vocals. Where was Max Bacon for these sessions? This could have been a hit- surely it does sound a bit like Asia, the most AOR track on the album. Nice one.Weightless - A song about Hang-gliding. Pleasant enough.Group Therapy - as the title of this track says, this jazzy instrumental is a great group effort, with Steve and Magnus trading off licks and the rhythm section providing a solid bed for them to go off.India Rubber Man - forgettable but short slow number which reprises the theme from 'Always Somewhere Else'.Hackett To Pieces - Another group number, this caps off Highly Strung rather nicely. In fact, with the heavy drumming, this also sounds like it could have been a Genesis number. Genesis could have performed this well, and would have had Steve remained with them.Solid playing, fine songs.

I guess I can see why. First of all, those who call Edge of Sanity a melodic Death Metal band are wrong. EOS has never been merely a 'melodic' Death band to begin with; it's just that they stressed melody and the structure of their songs had powerful hooks that grab listeners by their balls. If you go back to the roots of this amazing band, you'll discover that their first three albums are the epitome of old school Death Metal with a proggressive approach.Unorthodox is the 1992 release of EOS, but most of the songs were written between 1989 and 1991. The music presented on this record is very raw in style, crushingly heavy and incredibly powerful. All aspects of Death Metal are served here and they are also enhanced by proggy overtones (remember Dan Swano is one of the biggest progheads ever). Added to the mold of the songcraft are non-metal elements such as piano, keyboards, violin and even cello. Make no mistake though, none of these instruments are used to overpower, but they are utilised to add colour and texture as well as immense variety. As ""Enigma"" kicks off after the short instrumental track, we are faced with strangely accessible time signatures that continue to shift, change and redefine themselves. Right after Dan Swano's clean vocals (also the only clean vocals on the entire album) the intense rhythm work played by Sami Nerberg (and Dan Swano himself) abounds with so much energy that it is hard stay unresponsive to the magic that shines through. ""Enigma"" consists of three 'psalms', namely ""The Blessing"", ""Celestial Dissension"" and ""The Loss of Hallowed Life"". The cerebral lyrical theme is utilised in a call-and-response kind of vocal delivery and with each passing second the riff architecture is further developed. It finally explodes into a chaotic wall of sound. While I happen to like ""Enigma"" best on this record, the rest of songs are far from filler. On ""In the Veins"" and ""Darker Than Black"", Dan's vocals are particularly raw, but not as refined as they are on the later EOS albums. However these vocals seem to fit the music a lot better. Keep in mind that Dan Swano was only 18 when he recorded this album and his vocals are somewhat in the vein of the earliest Doom-Death bands: slow, tortured, yet heavily brutal!""Everlasting"" sees the band experimenting with various textures and the busy interplay during the main passage is stunning. The song structures are tremendously unorthodox (as the title itself suggests) and way ahead of their time. It's a shame this band got overlooked amongst the metal fans. I could name at least 50 Death Metal bands that came ten years after EOS and became a lot more popular. Similarly ""After Afterlife"" is a direct, speedy piece on the non-melodic spectrum of the genre. This sounds like a musical incarnation of entropic nihilism. The rhythm guitar pattern once again destroys (there are plenty of awesome RIFFS to be found here!) and pleases.

His band's songs, and Brennare's own instrumental and voice work, have much less of the virtuosity associated with this brand of ""melodic death metal"", but somehow Lake of Tears comes off sounding great, the simplicity a liberating influence which allows the band to focus on music and songs rather than need to dazzle.  By not struggling to impress, Lake of Tears does so mightily, at least to this listener.Sometimes it's hard to tell how seriously to take this music -- with titles like ""Boogie Bubble"", ""Cosmic Weed"" and ""Devil's Diner"", it's up for grabs.  But with a sound as good as this, who cares?  Brennare's rhythm work is great, heavy but not overwhelmingly dense, thus allowing for the top-end crunch so often missing from other distortion-happy metal guitarists.  Johan Oudhuis' drumming is also wonderful, simple and direct, creating a good clean groove for the songs, and Mikael Larsson's bass often contributes the anchoring hooks for the songs.  This band really knows how to make room for everybody, and the result is great-sounding recordings.The catchy bass intro to ""Boogie Bubble"" segues into a simple two-chord riff that carries the same pulsating metal groove as Metallica's best works; ""The Four Strings of Mourning"" is beautifully moody; ""Lady Rosenred"" has Brennare coupling vocals with clear-voiced Jennie Tebler to good effect, but with a bizarre double-time rhythm and disturbingly bare arrangement in the background; and ""Raistlin and the Rose""'s mix of pastoral keyboard melodies and crunching power chords suggest Lake of Tears' later record, Forever Autumn.This is a band that makes a great argument against the de-tuning trend in metal these days.  So many bands are obsessed about playing lower and lower (even Metallica tunes down to C now), with seven-string and baritone guitars, that they forget Tony Iommi from Black Sabbath, the godfather of this style, used a treble booster to get his sound.  Most metal bands now aim so much for the bass that they forget the top-end punch; Lake of Tears, on the other hand, achieves its aggression without having to saturate every song with 20 tracks of growly guitars, using dynamics and space rather than block-headed density.  A Crimson Cosmos rocks harder than most records these days, and it has the potential to appeal to both fans of this ""melodic metal"" style as well as more mainstream listeners.",5.0,Weird lyrics with great tunes and performances.,1109203200,"02 24, 2005",Sports_and_Outdoors,1.0

Yet, to hear Ray Lane and Ernie Harwell once again on this CD brings back so many great memories for me and of those hot, humid summer nights back in Detroit with my Dad listing to all of this on the radio.  Remember, this is a compliation of snippets of radio broadcasts during the season, and at BEST you'll get a VERY general overview of particular games and points during the season (i.e., you are not going to hear an entire game, nor even an entire inning or even an at bat).  But to hear Harwell and Lane's commentary of Kaline or Freehan hitting one out, or Mickey Stanley making a great catch, this is a CD for those to reminisce; not to do a comprehensive in-depth study of the season itself.  And the background music when Lane and Harwell recount a season is very similar to the NFL films music used back during that time for team highlights as well . .So (in my estimation), it is doubly pleasurable.  The part of the CD that I love the best is when Dick McAlliff charges the mound in a game against the White Sox after Tommy John brushes him back and gets suspended for 5 games.  Ray Lane then goes on to describe how the Tigers begin to fall apart during their roadtrip to NY, and you really get a heightened sense of alarm as to how he calls this.  For me, this is radio broadcasting and commentary at its very best.  Professional, and not hokey like today where everybody tries to be a ""Chris Berman knockoff.""If you're a Tigers fan, you will love this (especially if you lived there during the 68 season).

Vinyl re-releases these days are often a hit and miss deal. Just because an album is re-released on vinyl is not a guarantee that it will sound by default better than the CD version - a lot of technical factors come into play, different masters need to be made for the vinyl release, the physical limitations of the format, the quality of your own playback equipment and so on. However, I'm happy to report that MOV's vinyl re-release of this Stone Temple Pilots album is excellent in all counts, with an airy, ample soundstage and emphasis where it counts the most for a rock band - on the midrange.

Audiences loved and love them. Critics, however, have been slower to catch up.Nearly a decade on, it's clear that STP isn't and never was a &quot;grunge&quot; band at all; Stone Temple Pilots are a classic rock and roll outfit in the grand tradition, more Zeppelin than Vedder no matter how you slice it. And Purple, far from the pop-grunge fad it had been labeled, has aged better than most any other music of the era. With the spectre of the &quot;grunge press&quot; gone, music critics can now see what the fans saw all along: Purple is a modern classic, one of the greatest rock and roll albums since the rock and roll era began -- with playful, intelligent yet touching and reflective lyrics and a set of monster hooks and subtle riffs that make the album instantly listenable and eminently hum-alongable. There isn't an ounce of filler to be found on Purple.Since Purple, the Stone Temple Pilots have continued on to produce a string of quality albums on the forefront of music industry relevance that the critics have increasingly warmed to, without once dropping a dud on the market.

They're all heavy, but ripe with infectious radio hooks.Songs like ""Vasoline"" and ""Unglued"" are very fast and intense, but also incredibly catchy. Both also contain wicked guitar solos.""Internstate Love Song"" is a modern rock classic. It's breezy and pop friendly, but it still rocks at the same time. The main guitar riff is so catchy that it alone becomes the song's hook.""Still Remains"" is just..WOW. A glorious meeting of the ways between dream-pop, carefree psychadelia, and rock. Scott Weiland gives a passionate vocal performance on this one.""Kitchenware & Candybars"" is another un-Core sounding song with meditative, accoustic verses and a swirling chorus. The bridge in particular is very majestic with its orchestral flourishes.Other highlights include the introspective ""Big Empty"" (which perfects the soft/loud dynamics) and the raucous ""Army Ants"".If you don't already own this album, please..do so.

I do, however, have my perspective, and my experience with the album.Since I got into music heavily some six years ago, this has been the album I have listened to most.  Though I would call Pearl Jam my favorite band, STP has undoubtedly received the most stereo play in my house.  Why?The answer lies in the sheer excellence of this album.  It is no where near as heavy as most of Pearl Jam's work (conceptually, as in the lyrics, as opposed to instrumentation), but still manages to be relevant, heart wrenching and encouraging.  Try to hear &quot;If you should die before me ask if you can bring a firend&quot; and not feel some flicker of emotion run through you.  Ponder that line.  Would you want to be dead alone?The album is not without its faults, though.  For one, I rarely have gotten past the eighth or ninth track.  I do not know whether this is because I at one time deemed the second half unworthy, or because STP stacked the best parts of its line up at the beginning.  I do know that the end of the CD might be as foreign to me today as the day I bought it.Returning to the high points, I love the sound that STP puts across here.  They sound as if they are travelling in a direction that had not been explored much at that time.  They are climbing out of grunge and into somewhat of a nuclear fallout:  they combine grunge, classic seventies rock, and their own stylings to liven up their record.Buy this album!",4.0,What is Left To Say?,1001376000,"09 25, 2001",Sports_and_Outdoors,1.0

Lead by one of the best frontmen rock has seen in years you'd think that was all this band had going for it, but no. You also have a band that even outshine Scott at times, and that is saying a lot about how great this band is. In my mind I think if they were still together making music they'd be the rulers of their genre, God knows they were in the '90s alongside Pearl Jam. As for this CD, I can't find a single song I don't like. From beginning to end this is one of the best releases in over a decade. It's got the radio anthems (Vasoline, Interstate Love Song, Big Empty), and you've got the songs that didn't get airtime yet are still just as good as the singles (Meatplow, Lounge Fly, Unglued). If anyone doubted STP could top Core, they were proven wrong with this release.Starting with Meatplow was a wise decision, it bridges the gap between releases very well. Meatplow moves through the verses and choruses with ease, there's no slow point to this song. Vasoline is the reason I ended up getting this CD. At first it didn't sound like STP but after repeated listens it just gets into your head and you're stuck singing it to yourself days after hearing it. Lounge Fly is a pretty consistent song that stays stalled in between hard and light music. While the music is pretty hard throughout, Scott just sings throughout the song. I have no complaints though, I think his voice is perfect any way he uses it. Interstate Love Song has got to be one of my top ten favorite songs of all time. I've heard it an uncountable amount of times yet it still sounds fresh, like the day I heard it for the first time. I can't help of thinking of a summer day when I hear it. Pretty Penny is one of the best rock ballads I've heard in recent memory. Although it grows a bit stale over repeated listens the lyrics still beg your attention. I'm hardpressed to think of a song so touching. While Big Empty is a bit flat through the verses the chorus simply soars, Scott's voice has yet to be better. The lyrics aren't extremely good but the mood and way they are presented makes for a great song. Kitchenware & Candybars is, I feel, the best way to end this CD. It's not as hard hitting as Core was so there's no need to end with a song like Where The River Goes. No, just a brooding song dripping with emotion like Kitchenware does is more than you could ask for. It's only fitting that this CD ends this way too. The not so hidden track is a comedic listen at best, although I do wish they would've just faded out with Kitchenware. But no big complaints about it, it just reminds you that this is a band who enjoys making music.All in all my favorite songs are Meatplow, Vasoline, Interstate Love Song, Big Empty, and Kitchenware & Candybars. I feel that whether you like commercial rock or underground rock, whatever kind of music you listen to, you will be able to see the beauty this CD contains. Hands down, this is one of the best CDs of the 90s, not to mention STPs best. If you have yet to hear this then you should feel ashamed letting a gem like this go unheard.",5.0,Fine place for a day full of breakdowns,1129248000,"10 14, 2005",Sports_and_Outdoors,1.0

I also have the translucent purple original pressing, so I am fortunate enough to have a comparison.ARTWORK:The jacket artwork on the reissue is very blurry like the CD cover was blown up whereas the original pressing is very sharp and high resolution.  The insert in the reissue is identical to the original, except that it is now 2 pages folded and there is additional artwork of the original master tapes. Very cool!  MOV has confirmed that the record was actually cut from 192kHz/24bit digital archives of the master tapes, however, and you can actually see the stickers on the master tape boxes indicating that they were digitally archived.VINYL QUALITY:I have the purple Purple vinyl and the pressing itself is on-center and dead quiet.  I'd like to say that's normal for MOV, but it's been a bit hit or miss for this audiophile geared reissue company.  For comparison, my lightly used original pressing  is way off center on side B, and the vinyl is extremely noisy, so this is a breath of fresh air in that regard.SOUND QUALITY:The sound is quite distinctively and unusually different from the CD and original pressing.  ""Unusually"" because for most vinyl pressings, you have to really think about the sound improvements vs the digital equivalent, but that is certainly not the case for this copy.  While the original pressing is obviously cut from the CD master leaving any sound differences up to your equipment, this reissue is an entirely different beast.  Where the original mastering sounds V shaped (boosted bass, lowered mid, boosted treble), this sounds completely opposite (A shaped?), and is also a bit more centered which is becoming the norm for MOV (I like a wide soundstage, but I guess they don't).  It's hard to explain, but it sounds awesome until you compare it to the CD.  Basically if you drop the needle and sit back and listen, it sounds wonderful.  But, if you then decide to cue up the CD to the same spot and flip over to it, it's a total shock how different it sounds, and it's kind of like ""Oh yeah, that's how I remember it sounding, but now it doesn't sound very good, it's too thin and harsh"".  So then you switch it back to the vinyl and now all the sudden it sounds really weird because there's a ton of mid and no bass or sparkle in the treble, so now that doesn't sound good anymore either.  Basically- pop on the vinyl and enjoy it, and don't give in to the urge to compare or else you'll be disappointed all around.",4.0,2013 Vinyl is good but very different,1375228800,"07 31, 2013",Sports_and_Outdoors,1.0

{'$oid': '5a132768741a2384e847c5de'},AC0Z6U9OWFRT0,B000002IZ4,Daniel Maltzman,"[17, 18]","The massive success of Stone Temple Pilots debut album ""Core"" (1992) was something of a mixed blessing for the group. While the album was a runaway smash, ultimately selling eight million copies and spawning such radio staples as ""Plush,"" ""Sex Type Thing"" and ""Creep,"" success definitely came at a price. Almost immediately the San Diego group was viciously and mercilessly attacked and ripped apart by the press. Accusations of ripping off the Seattle grunge scene and jumping on the flavor of the month alternative bandwagon were the most common complaints. ""Plush,"" in particular was singled out as plagiarizing Pearl Jam.Truth be told, these accusations were not without merit. While the band insisted that the bulk of ""Core"" was written as far back as 1988, the album did sound derivative of the Seattle soundbook. Released in 1992, ""Core"" blended the punkish riffs of Nirvana, the baritone growls and stylistic craft of Pearl Jam, and the metallic crunch of Alice In Chains. But with ""Core,"" the album was ultra radio friendly, the songs ultra infectious, which made the album both a smash hit and a number one target.Was ""Core"" a rip-off? Maybe. A great record? Most defiantly. But where to go from there?Stone Temple Pilots had a lot to prove with their sophomore album. The second album is often the hardest, as the ""sophomore slump"" is not uncommon. With their credibility and integrity under so much criticism, STP had to not only come up with a great bunch of songs, they also had to stretch their artistic muscle, lest their critics label them a disingenuous, opportunistic one-album-wonder.Recoded in just one month, STP's sophomore album ""Purple"" was released in the spring of 1994. Compared to ""Core,"" ""Purple"" is a far leaner, muscular album, sounding far less generic. While ""Purple"" doesn't sound 180 degrees radically different from the debut, much of the borrowing of the sounds of the Seattle ""big four"" (Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Alice In Chains) is left behind as STP was starting to find their own voice. With their second album the band sounds tighter, more cohesive. Dean DeLeo's riffs and solos should have been a breath of fresh air for anyone longing for the days of 70s guitar-heavy AOR. Vocalist Scott Weiland, always one for experimenting with sounds (just look at his underrated 1998 solo album ""12 Bar Blues"") gives the songs a lot of color, making them far above average. Eric Kretz (drums) and Robert DeLeo (bass) as always, provide an exciting and dynamic rhythm section.Many fans/critics/reviewers have labeled ""Purple"" a ""grunge"" album. Truth be told, however, ""Purple"" doesn't really have the characteristics of the grunge sound. Grunge is all about ""the fuzz"" with intense drumming, feedback, a ""dirty"" guitar, etc. Bands like Nirvana, Mudhoney, early Soundgarden, Hole, Green River, etc, exemplified the grunge sound. ""Purple,"" by comparison, is far more commercial. STP was never meant to be an underground band with street cred, as the band lusted after the arenas from day one.  STP wrote songs that were made to be played on the radio, not Sub Pop compilations. And while ""Core"" borrowed from the Seattle scene, ""Purple"" sees a strong Zeppelin/Sabbath influence, with psychedelic trimmings. In addition, there was nothing anarchic about STP; their songs were well-crafted and, at the risk of sounding cynical, calculated.  So to call ""Purple,"" a grunge album is incorrect. Rather, ""Purple"" is a fine collection of 70s inspired, muscular hard-rock with a twist of psychedelia.The grinding, sludgy ""Meat Plow"" gets things off to a great start and would make Tony Iommi himself proud. The classic ""Vasoline,"" a modern-rock staple, is one of the band's all-time greats. The Zeppelin-like riff and strong melody make it incredibly infectious and rock hard. The album takes an unexpected psychedelic twist with ""Lounge Fly,"" throwing the listener a curve-ball. The track actually sounds a bit like Hendrix's ""Are you Experienced?"" Destined to be played on classic rock stations in 20 years time, ""Interstate Love Song,"" which was the number-one mainstream rock song for nearly four months, is another vintage STP classic. The majestic ""Still Remains"" is big and epic in scope, swooping up the listener in a colorful sea of sounds. The sparse ""Pretty Penny"" sounds akin to ""Friends"" from ""Led Zeppelin III"" (1970). The hard-rocking ""Silvergun Superman"" wouldn't have sounded out-of-place on ""Core"" and while not the album's strongest cut, keeps up the momentum. Featured on the ""Crow"" (1994) soundtrack, the epic, ominous ""Big Empty"" was another smash from ""Purple"" and remains a 90s classic. While most of ""Purple"" avoided sounding derivative of anything Seattle, the bone-crunching ""Unglued"" and ""Army Ants"" sound very Nirvana-esque. However, these two cuts are so infectious, with such great hooks and rock so hard; STP is given a free pass. The haunting, ambitious ""Kitchenware and Candybars"" concludes the album nicely. Just when you think the album is done, however, you are hit with the totally bizarre ""the second album"" an unlisted bonus track (thus making ""Purple"" a collection of ""12 gracious melodies."") Much like how the closing ""My World"" from Guns N' Roses ""Use Your Illusion II"" (1991) stuck out like a sore thumb, this lounge-lizard ditty is totally out-of-place, but it's cool in its own way and works.With a little bit of Sabbath, Zeppelin, psychedelia, Nirvana and a lounge number thrown in the mix, ""Purple"" is a pretty cool, diverse collection of songs. In some ways, ""Purple"" is somewhat of an underrated album. While ""Purple"" is generally regarded as the band's best work, many of its songs are over-looked. While ""Purple"" is renowned for its big singles (""Vasoline,"" ""Interstate Love Song,"" ""Big Empty"") the album is chock-full of memorable great songs.With ""Purple"" STP proved that they were no one-album-wonder. They fought back accusations of trend-hopping by writing a memorable, eclectic collection of songs, much to the chagrin of their detractors. So while many figured STP to be just a flash-in-the-pan, with ""Purple,"" STP proved that they were just getting started...",5.0,STP fights back...,1152403200,"07 9, 2006",Sports_and_Outdoors,1.0

It still has grunge efforts, but they  have a more extensive range in this one.Buy this CD if only for the  hits: &quot;Interstate Love Song&quot; held it's own with the group's other  SUPER hit &quot;Plush&quot; from &quot;Core.&quot; ILS stayed number one on  the charts for 17 weeks and is one of the most known songs of the 90s. The  same can be said about &quot;Plush&quot; and it could take hours to figure  out which one really was the bigger hit...however any group that could  produce two songs that were so damn popular deserve to be in the hall of  fame.Two other smash hits on this one: &quot;Vasoline,&quot; a simple  but excellent grunge anthem that secured STP's success, and &quot;Big  Empty,&quot; the song everyone would know from &quot;The Crow&quot;  soundtrack. &quot;Big Empty&quot; is the better of the two...and I would  bet my LIFE that anyone would recognize it in the first five seconds of the  song. The cool slide guitar work and mysterious lyrics secured The Crow's  platinum status. Topping that off with one of the catchiest choruses of all  time, &quot;Big Empty&quot; is reason enough to by any album.Thankfully,  this album trimmed the filler from &quot;Core.&quot; In the grunge  category, there is &quot;Meatplow,&quot; a wonderful rocker with cool but  meaningless lyrics, and &quot;Lounge Fly&quot; which kinda sounds like  Alice In Chains in its own weird way.Alternative rockers are the  majority here:&quot;Still Remains&quot; is a preview of the mysticism  that would be all over their next (better) release, &quot;Tiny  Music...&quot; while the same can be said about &quot;Pretty Penny&quot;  and their latest release, No. 4.&quot;Silvergun Superman&quot; is one of  STP's finest tunes, and is basic rock and roll that could have been  released in the 70s.

Overshadowed by the bitterly cerebral Kurt Cobain and Pearl Jam Eddie Vedder's bombastic, sonorous voice--and being emotionally more akin to Radiohead--the STP spent several albums trying to claw their way out of the flannelled scene of the times, all the while being accused--often correctly--of mimicking other bands.With Purple, they got it right.  The DeLeo brothers' incredible songwriting paired with Weiland's lyrics to form an accreted image of a self-punishing naif flailing--but not quite drowning--in the wicked world.  Life's aches and pains permeated all these tunes, the best of which--Interstate Love Song, Big Empty, Lounge Fly, Vaseline, the ridiculously named and shockingly good ""Meatplow"" --plead for understanding in the face of complete relational impasse.Too, Weiland's voice was an unsung hero, as it were: a flexible, reedy tenor bouncing between raw and warm vibratto--far prettier than he was ever given credit for.  The DeLeos filled their songwriting with quirky, Byzantine chord progressions and hooks pounded out of guitars in a violent sludge that never, ever overwhelmed the searching tunes.

""Purple"" is quirky and unexpected where ""Core"" was more predictable hard core grunge but ""Purple"" is also the much, much better album both in the quality of the songwriting and the complexity of the ideas of the tracks.No doubting that ""Core"" has a few killer tracks and ""Plush"" with its simple and yet complex sounding chords made me and my band want to cover as many of their tracks as we could but we found that we ended up covering more tracks on ""Purple"" instead because they were more interesting and fun to play.  That's the beauty of STP in that the De Leo brothers were never shy of experimenting with chords and they would purposely avoid playing a standard chord and look for more exotic ones to substitute them with.  ""Plush"" is a great example of this and it's so simple to play that even though all these years I haven't played it on the guitar, I still feel confident I can simply pick up my guitar and still play 90% of the piece without error.""Purple"" is almost like a jazz album in the way it's written and is a real enigma to me even to this day.  Starting out with the brilliant ""MeatPlow"" that is overflowing with exotic-sounding chords, the album moves on to one of my old band's favourite songs to warm up to, ""Vasoline"", and carries on to what can only be described as what country music would sound grunge style in ""Interstate Love Song"" one of my band's favourite tracks to cover.  The riffs and the intro has a distinctly country feel about them.Then we get the acoustic and excellent ""Pretty Penny"" which is a joy to play if you are into folk guitar because yet again, we get to play exotic chords all the way.  ""Big Empty"" is simply another beautiful track and is one of their best ever.  ""Unglued"" is the ultimate jam song and one of the easiest to play but sounds very complex indeed.All the tracks flow very nicely here and like any classic album, move the tracks in any other order and the overall album suffers for it.  I can't wait for a proper remastering job on this album and on ""Core"" with perhaps a mini-lp sleeve packaging design thrown in as well.By far, STP's best album and one of the best grunge albums of all time.

Obviously the criticism must have hurt; enter their second kick in the teeth, Purple. This was a turning point in STP's career, considering this album was relased two months after the death of grunge's poster boy, Kurt Cobain, and the musicial ""trend"" would soon follow him to the grave. Scott Weiland and Co. were obviously on a mission, taking what they had learned and listening to what was around them;listen to ""Vasoline"" and you'll hear a hint of Red Hot Chili Peppers funk, carried by the bass of Robert DeLeo. Then there's "" Interstate Love Song"", which in my opinion is just out of the top ten of the best hard rock songs of the 90's.

Alternative grunge rock had taken hold right at the start of the decade with bands like Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Nirvana and Alice In Chains gaining widespread popularity. Plenty of other groups though were trying out the whole grunge trend. One of these bands was the Stone Temple Pilots. Originally coming on the scene in 1992 with their debut album 'Core', the 'Pilots were at first given the tag of being Pearl Jam rip-offs. However, with their debut the band showed they had the makings of becoming one of the great acts of the 90's. 'Stone Temple Pilots' (also known as 'Purple'), the Stone Temple Pilots second studio album, released in 1994 was the bands much awaited follow up to their successful first album. 'Purple' has in time grown to be the band's most popular album release. So, does 'Purple' really deserve the critical acclaim that it has been given.Let's make it simple; this album is a masterpiece. With this album, the Stone Temple Pilots totally found their sound. If their debut left some people writing the band off as rip-offs, 'Purple' completely smothers the idea. More than just a straight ahead hard rock, riff filled album, the Stone Temple Pilots reveal the more diverse side of their music, which is what in many ways gives the band their own identity and sets them apart from the pack. This album is alternative rock at its most refined. Breaking away from the 'grunge' mold (however you interpret that), this album is a mix of songs with powerful riffing (i.e. 'Meat Plow' or 'Silvergun Superman') and slower stuff (i.e. 'Big Empty'), plus not to forget the more diverse songs like the acoustically driven 'Pretty Penny'. On the whole, you can easily say that some of the band's best songs are on this album and you can tell this as the instrumentation and lyrics feel completely assured right through the album. Lead guitarist Dean DeLeo his brother bassist Robert DeLeo show how diverse guitar playing can be on this album, where we go from the harder more metal sounding riffs, to acoustic and country sounding moments. Scott Weiland's lyrics are at times crazy and other times powerful and cynical. However, the powerful vocal style the man has makes the words blend easily with the music. 'Purple' is quite simply one of those albums were all of the songs work without sounding out of place or inconsistent. 'Purple' is 11 years old but has that remarkably fresh appeal to it every time you listen to it.There is one thing though that really hacks me off about this album and the same goes for the album's follow up, 'Tiny Music'. You guessed it, its the back cover of the CD; there is no tracklisting. This is a mistake that you hope will be corrected in time because it always helps to be able to see whats on the album, especially when your viewing the CD over before buying it from a shop!So what about the 12 gracious melodies this album gives us. STP kick off their second album with 'Meat Plow', a heavy riffed opener. Weiland sings this one with a down and out style, a great opening song. 'Vasoline' fades in next, with some quirky guitar hooks and pronounced drumming. The chorus on this one is awesome where Weiland sings 'it isn't you, isn't me' to a great guitar riff. Next is 'Lounge Fly', a sonic sounding opening, with some more pounding riffs. Weiland's lyrics gives this song a pent up aggressive side. Things slow down next for 'Interstate Love Song', the guitar play is a perfect mix of hard riffs with a bit of a country sound. A great ballad styled song where Weiland sings about events past, and things/people you've left behind. 'Still Remains' keeps up the power driven riffs; again the band jam out a great chorus with some clever echoeing singing from Weiland. Eric Kretz drums out a great surprise entry towards the end of the track.'Pretty Penny' is one of the more diverse tracks on the album. Its got a great acoustic sound. Crazier lyrics follow with 'Silver Gun Superman'. You've gotta love the metal riffs to this one. For me though, 'Big Empty' is the greatest track on the album, Weiland yearns out the opening verse before the song builds into a great driving chorus, at its most powerful where Weiland screams 'conversations kill'. This song is a perfect mix of the bands melodic and experimental sides. The supercharged 'Unglued' follows, a 2 minute bashed out rocker that you NEVER get tired of playing again and again. 'Army Ants' starts suspiciously before building into another explosive song. However 'Kitchenware and Candybars' is a great change to finish the album. Again like a ballad, the song has a great orchestral addition at the end to accompany some luscious riffs and some emotive vocals. Keep this track running though for the twelfth song (its fixed onto track eleven), a funny song where Weiland sings about the 'second' album to the tune of trumpets and hammond organ!When people look back on the 90's era of music, yes they will think about the bands who set the trends like the Pearl Jam and others. However, im confident that the Stone Temple Pilots will also be remebered as one of the great alternative rock acts also, in no part due to this masterpiece of an album. This was the first STP album that I bought and I loved every minute of it from the first listen.

One of the strongest (and most overlooked) songs on the album, it is a thundering, original fresh blast of air, despite what all the critics say about STP ripping off (admittedly superior) bands like Nirvana and Pearl Jam. It is followed by 'Vasoline', which is over before you really get a feel for it. The saving grace of 'Lounge Fly' is its mellow, acoustic midsection which is far more affecting than the louder riffery of its first half. 'Interstate Love Song' and 'Still Remains' are two different views of love, both featuring memorable riffs. Weiland's chorus line &quot;if you should die before me ask if you could bring a friend&quot; are the most affecting lyrics on the album. 'Pretty Penny' and 'Big Empty' are slower tracks that grow on you, but neither is a standout. 'Unglued' and 'Army Ants' are both saved by their choruses and cool guitar riffs. 'Kitchenware &amp; Candybars' is unusual, but a decent closer. The secret track, '12 Gracious Melodies', is so ridiculous and overdone you can't help but love it. After a few listens you'll never get it out of your head. However, best of all these songs is 'Silvergun Superman', an edgy, longish (by STP's standards) epic with unique song structure and striking, whispered verses.

Gordon,"[2, 2]","When Stone Temple Pilots hit it big in 1993 with their debut ""Core"", the band's rather obvious attempt to align its image with the then-popular grunge scene earned them derision.  However, once you looked beyond frontman Scott Weiland's dyed hair, goatee, and somewhat Eddie Vedder-esqe vocals (although it was more due to their mutual appreciation of the Doors), songs like ""Plush"", ""Sex-Type Thing"", and the almost joyous grinding pop-metal of ""Wicked Garden"" all indicated that the band had a canny understanding of hard arena rock.  Indeed, the slick production values and unwillingness to indulge in aimless alt-rock/grunge noise jams belied an ultra-professional approach that just required some stronger material to fit between their singles (notwithstanding a couple of quality deep cuts such as ""Where the River Goes"").  The question was whether Stone Temple Pilots would, as one of the first bands to so obviously jump on the grunge bandwagon, simply be another one hit wonder to join the scrapheap of forgotten bands trying to cash in on a trend.It was with their self-titled second album, also known as ""Purple"" to most, that Stone Temple Pilots showed that they could transcend the cheap image gimmick they used to get their foot in the door.  While it's not that likely that you'll find a lot of demand for grunge copycat bands such as Bush, Silverchair, the Kennedys or others of the age to mount a comeback, the fact that the Stone Temple Pilots 2008 reunion generated excitement is in no small part due to this album, and the eclectic blueprint it laid out for their subsequent releases.  While both Scott Weiland and the rest of the band attempted to find success independent of each other, it's the combination of Weiland's unpredictable charisma (part David Bowie, part Jim Morrison, and part chemical ingestion) and the hyper-professional musicianship of the DeLeo brothers and Eric Kretz that brings forth their best.  Even someone like me, who's more likely to be listening to German heavy metal or Eighties pop than grunge, can't help but salute STP for delivering the goods better than even original grunge bands such as Soundgarden and Pearl Jam, which both ended up exhausting their inspiration within a few years, and released albums laden with self-indulgent yet poorly performed filler tracks that managed to not even be experimental in a good way.  Compare the plinking and pointless droning all-too prevalent in Soundgarden's ""Down on the Upside"" with the professional, multi-faceted sounds found on later STP albums such as ""Number 4"" and ""Shangri-La-Dee-Da"".On ""Purple"", STP dropped the uniform, single-minded production found in ""Core"", and roughened things up a bit, while still keeping things quite listenable and appealing to a broad audience.  It was this album that pretty much confirmed that the band actually understood what made Led Zeppelin tick.  Larger than life anthems such as ""Still Remains"", ""Big Empty"" and the megahit ""Interstate Love Song"" mingled with the acoustic, exotic ""Pretty Penny"" (a song that would've fit in well on Led Zeppelin III), and the psychadelic ""Lounge Fly"".  Faster, aggressive songs such as ""Vasoline"" and ""Unglued"" also helped propel this album's popularity, while slower, heavy numbers such as ""Meatplow"" and ""Silvergun Superman"" channeled a Sabbath vibe.  Throughout all these songs, a melodic, catchy sensibility is the common element linking them together, with a subtle, contradictory love of prog-rock lying just below the surface.  The band would continue to mine their devotion to the concept of maximizing the effectiveness of the album medium on subsequent albums.While Stone Temple Pilots are far from original, they never claimed to be world-changing.  Nonetheless, they're far from the mere bar-band with freakish success that some critics think they are. In the end, it's perhaps their devotion to being entertainers first and foremost that keeps people like me intrigued....when they're not busy going on hiatus or breaking up that is.  Let's hope that the reunion lasts, and that the new STP album carries on the tradition they started with ""Purple"".",5.0,True Arena Rock For the Nineties,1215388800,"07 7, 2008",Sports_and_Outdoors,1.0

Core was no rip-off, no, but it was just slightly ""too"" similar to the other bands of the time. Purple has also more range and is more ""daring"", and better guitar work, you can just sense the great musicianship and passion from track to track, this album was the real diamond for Stone Temple Pilots, if you're more into 90's rock in general, perhaps ""Core"" is an album a bit easier to get into, but once you get into ""Purple"", you'll love it. STP is perhaps the best 90's band there was, I like most of the other bands (Soundgarden, PJ, Nirvana, AIC..), but it's just that STP managed to ""reinvent"" themselves album to album, but yet having their own style and sense in everything. If we go to the members, singer Scott Weiland, has a great voice and a great talent to use it, there's undeniable charm and presence in his voice and great lyrics, being mysterious in his texts, but not to the point that it's annoying, and you don't have to wonder if the lyrics have a point or just fancy words. Dean Deleo, has slightly improved here since ""Core"", not that he wasn't great then, but ""Purple"" just offers more range and especially solos, which were a slight lack on ""Core"". Bassists are very underrated in general, and I can't really tell if a bassist is great or poor, but Robert Deleo has great basslines! Eric Kretz obviously knows his job too... This is the best album STP gave out! If you haven't still gotten into STP, and you're a rock fan, don't hesitate, get this one, and their other releases too! See, STP were perhaps annoyingly much shadowed by Nirvana or Pearl Jam, and because of that, some (dumb) people might actually think that STP was just one of those grunge rip off bands coming out in the mid to late 90's (Creed, Godsmack, Seven Mary Three), no, no, no! STP was one of the original bands! There are no filler songs on the album, every track is perfect! and the songs don't get too similar or repetitive!

Some bands outdo themselves and make a great second album, but some end up falling flat and never surface again. In the case of Stone Temple Pilots second album (call it PURPLE or self-titled if you will), they avoid the sophomore jinx and make a terrific album full of sludgy, crunchy hard rock with some real surprises thrown in for good measure. Guitarist Dean DeLeo continues to throw out memorable riffs, and his brother bassist Dean DeLeo and drummer Eric Kretz continue to provide a great rhythm section for Scott Weiland's impressive vocal turn. He's lost some grit, but his voice is better on this album (he was still good on CORE) and he outdoes himself.""Big Empty"" is easily one of the best hard-rock singles ever released to radio, and the term ""power"" ballad might apply even though its dreamy hard rock makes it even more powerful (no wonder it was featured on THE CROW soundtrack). ""Interstate Love Song"" was one of the best songs released in 1994, and it demonstrates Stone Temple Pilots ability to craft a great song. And while the band still shows it's tough side on tracks like the thundering ""Silvergun Superman"", the percussion thunder of ""Lounge Fly"" and the thrashing ""Unglued"", they also show a melodic flair on the pretty acoustic ""Pretty Penny"" and the contemplative ""Kitchenware & Candybars"". Throughout this second album, Stone Temple Pilots have really crafted a very strong, memorable, and cohesive set that improves on the highly successful debut, which showcased a more raw, raucous sound. Other memorable cuts include the head-banger pleasers ""Meatplow"" and ""Army Ants"", and the very catchy ""Vasoline"". Not one bad song in this bunch, unless you want to count that incredibly cheesy ""hidden track"" which thankfully is left last so you can skip it.So thankfully, Stone Temple Pilots avoided the sophomore jinx and PURPLE (or the self-titled album) was another huge success.

They had been roasted with their debut CORE because of the heavy sludge attack of that record.  Stone Temple Pilots were accused of being rather dull copy-cat `artists', learning from Pearl Jam and Nirvana their entire bag of tricks and then replicating it with rather boring results.  CORE's main problem, of course, is it gets very bogged down in the full assault of that heavy grunge sound, and Stone Temple Pilots don't rely on much else to carry the record through.The critics this time were fairly right.  With the exception of the four singles (Wicked Garden, Sex Type Thing, Creep, and Plush), which stand as some of the very best songs of the early 1990s and as important as anything Nirvana, Pearl Jam, and the other grungies were doing at the time.  These tracks were tempered with melodicism, heavy-hitting music, and a great acoustic sound which rivals even Alice in Chains (who I believe has the best acoustic sound of any of the grunge heavy weights).PURPLE is miles ahead of their debut.  While they still retain the trademark sludge of grunge, they temper it greatly and vary things up enough to make their sound much more interesting, and in the process give the other grunge bands a run for their money.Of course, recrafting your sound does not make the new record any better than the old one unless you have songs to go along with it (Sixteen Stone vs. Razorblade Suitcase).  This is where PURPLE shines.  As far as I'm concerned this record plays like a greatest hits record, or a compilation of essential early 1990s tracks.  Without exception, every song on here is as good as the singles I cited from CORE.  Stone Temple Pilots turned in a set that almost every song sounds like it has the potential to be a radio hit, and while critics and fans may cringe thinking that means they've sold out, Stone Temple Pilots sound their best when they're doing rock that could get on the radio*.PURPLE sounds much more commercially minded than CORE, but in this case that's not a weakness or artistic compromise.  Instead, PURPLE sounds much more like a band that has at long last come into their signature sound, and they're damn good at what they do.  Just like The Who's MEATY, BEATY, BIG, & BOUNCY, everyone of these tracks shows an excellent band producing high quality singles which ranks as the best music from that time.  The thing that sets PURPLE apart artistically, with its commercial sound, is it sounds genuine and a natural evolution of the band, and never once feels manufactured at all (if you want manufactured grunge-by-numbers rock get SIXTEEN STONE by Bush).  PURPLE sounds both legitimate artistically and exhilarting musically, making it one of the most exciting records of the early 1990s.Buy Purple now, as it stands as one of the essential records from the 1990s.  Stone Temple Pilot never topped it, but resting on the strength of this and their other singles they will be sure to be remembered.Mike London*Well, not all the songs sound like a hit grunge single.  The last track, 12 Gracious Melodies, is a hilarious novelty track.  I wish they had put ""Tripping on a Hole in a Paper Heart"" on here.  It so fits the sound on Purple, enough so that I almost think it's an outtake from this record..  That and ""Dancing Days"" too.  I knew that song from STP and didn't know it was a Zeppelin track until much later, so I always think of the STP version of it.

""Interstate Love Song,"" probably their biggest hit, is an instant classic. My least favorite is ""Pretty Penny,"" an acoustic number that just doesn't hit the right notes for me, sounding borderline atonal. That's not counting the joke song ""12 Gracious Melodies"" that closes the album and finds singer Scott Weiland in lounge lizard territory to hilarious effect.

Scott Weiland once stated that all he ever wanted was for STP to be known as a straight-up rock and roll band; not alternative, not grunge and notPearl Jam. Why ask Weiland? Because he's one of the most talented and enigmatic lead singers of his time. The guy's astounding voice glazes these songs like butter, further sugarcoating what is a pop-at-heart album to begin with.From the get-go, STP come out swinging on ""Purple,"" stating its  indifference to the harsh rat race of the rock 'n' roll big leagues. On  the opener, ""Meatplow,"" Weiland's lyrics show longing for his soon-to-be  wife (and later ex-wife) and his brother, rather than the exploitive  spotlight of fame, fortune and unjustified criticism. Rather than portray himself as a status symbol for the good or bad of rock music, Weiland shows his humanity. The plodding rhythm is a far cry from the next tune, Vaseline, where the momentous beginning and frantic pace suggest a newfound immediacy from STP. Not the band's best song by a longshot, ""Vaseline"" was still an astute release by a group not always known for its get-to-the-point message. The melodic country sound of ""Interstate Love Song"" diversified the Pilots' sound and remained a hit on the radio for a long time. Weiland's lyrics are sensitive on ""Purple"" as he gets downright gushy over his longtime girlfriend on ""Still Remains,"" a song with an almost Rattlike hook. Interestingly, the lyrics ""take a bath I'll drink the water that you leave"" on ""Still Remains"" are light years away from the energetic and raunchier ""Sex Type Thing."" Maturity and musical depth is further found on ""Pretty Penny,"" an acoustic number that works wonderfully, if not a little eerily due to a noticeably toned-down and quirkier sound and vibe.Halfway through ""Purple"" is when STP belt out the rockers, more  commercialized and pop stuff than on ""Core."" Among them, ""Unglued"" displays Weiland belting out his frustrations to Robert Deleo's head-bobbing guitar that would set any mosh pit on fire in ten seconds; ""Big Empty"" rocks between jazzy interludes; and ""Army Ants"" is a thrusty rocker, the total antithesis to the Rolling Stones' ""time is on my side"" mentality. ""Purple"" ends with the same basic message it started out with, on a song that's both gentle and rocking: ""Kitchenware and Candybars."" Those with a sense of humor will appreciate the lounge singer crooning on the hidden track, which allows STP to have the last laugh afterall. And who knows? Given the band's talent and gravitation toward experimenting with new sounds, we may just hear Weiland lounging out grandly someday.

The next song, vasoline, a massive radio hit, is very concise in song structure. The music on this song is also very repetitous and hard. Lounge Fly, the next track on the album is also very hard and in additon to this precussion heavy.Interstate Love Song, a classic alt.rock/hardrock single follows Lounge Fly. Hook filled and concise, the song finishes in about 3:20. ""Leavin on a Southern Train only yesterday you lied"" sings Scott Wieland in delusionment.The rest of the album is similar. Most of the songs are very concise like the first half of the album. Still remains is a beautifully written song discussing sexual tension. Pretty Penny is an acoustic song that sounds much different from the other songs on the album. Ah yes... Silver Gun Superman... a hard rock song that discussing jealously in relationships... should please headbangers. Big Empty is a catchy power ballad, that is featured in the movie The Crow. Unglued is a hard rock song discussing let's just say something very common in a teenage boy's life... ok.... Army Ants a song that has awesome lyrics and a very interesting meaning if you can understand Scott's heroine induced babbling.

But it had struck a note with the public leading them to begin recording a follow up.  It was released on June 7th, 1994.  The record followed a lot of the same territory that the first did with plenty f grunge and hard rock sensibilities.  Even with that said though, the subtle shift to psychedelic rock can be seen here as well (i.e. ""Lounge Fly"").  It went on to sell over 6 million copies.  But does the cd live up to the hype when played?  Let's go through it track by track... (1 to 5 scale)1.  ""Meatplow""  4.9  Solid start to the cd.  Weird lyrics and grinding guitars let you know STP is back baby.2.  ""Vasoline""  5.0  Another rock staple.  The heavy effects at the start are very memorable.3.  ""Lounge Fly""  4.2  STP's first foray into psychedelic rock.  It works moderately well.  Only profanity on the album is heard on this track.4.  ""Interstate Love Song""  5.0  Probably the best song on the whole album.  A groove with a cool melody and great lyrics to match.  And the video is good too.  There is nothing negative I can say about this song.5.  ""Still Remains""  4.3  A beautiful love song.  My mom always thought the ""Take a bath, I'll drink the water that you leave"" line was gross.

Guitar work is great too.8.  ""Big Empty""  5.0  This song was also on The Crow soundtrack.  And also appeared on their unplugged special on MTV.  Excellent song.  Love the slide guitar.

I know alot of people love this song and it's not a bad song per say, but it sounds like a B-Side from ""Core"" with rawer production and doesn't level up to the quality of the rest of the songs on this album.That being said, this album shows the band stepping out of the box more and it pays off greatly. Their ballads sound sweeter, they incorporate experimentation, and Scott Weiland begins to use his vocal range more and hit higher notes. It doesn't serve a purpose to review each song because all of them (with the exception of ""Meatplow"" personally), were a step in the right direction. The production and mixing is less overwhelming as well which was a huge help in letting the songs breathe and let the life that was in them get a chance to come out and become more vibrant.My personal favorites off this album are: Still Remains, Vasoline, Big Empty, Pretty Penny, and Unglued.In summary, you can't go wrong if you get this album from such an underrated band.

The lower review comes from musical uneducatedness more than anything else.First, we must get out of the way while STP is lumped in the ""grunge"" movement they were not a true band of that genre. The DeLeo Brothers have more at heart and in common with 70s hard rock than Kurt Cobain's shameless ripoff of The Pixies. The first album CORE causes confusion because it sure sounds like grunge. I view that album as a switch and bait. It was very much the ""big"" sound at the time. It got STP on the radar to where they could loosen up and throw off the shackles the musically limiting grunge genre. For this the trendy grunge fans bag on STP fiercly for daring to grow beyond grunge. Posuers might be a word they'd use. I'm ok with them doing that, because STP moved beyond grunge for the right reasons. Its a term thrown out because of envy. I like the spirit and integrity of making your own road.Purple is a very ambitious and deep record. It captures a band at thier creative zenith. There is also something here that I've not noticed in many years from a band - emotion. Not cliched anger, or fury so prevalent in today's ""alternative"" corporate crap.  I'm speaking more of sublety, sure there is some in-your-face-ness, but there is also love and even sadness. Which in rock is very difficult to pull off. Anger is easy, but having a wide array of emotion in a release - especially in the 1990s was rare.Classics abound from Interstate Love Song to Vasoline. My personal favorite though is Kitchenware and Candybars - what a deep emotional cut!The flow of the album is brillant. As is the song selections. There isn't any filler at all here. Which is a rarity.If you've only heard CORE, Scott Weiland changes his approach for the better. Weiland loses the overused forced baritone and sings much more naturally with wonderful results.I could continue to sing the praises of this record. However, you get the point. Many other reviewers agree with me. The ones that don't fit into the aformentioned Grunge crowd who hurl predictable invectives at STP.If you don't own this record you are missing one of the higher points of 1990s rock. In an era where the diversity, depth and willingness to take you places was all but gone. STP stepped up and delivered an album that 20 years from now will still be considered essentual.",5.0,STP the Monkees? Puhleeez.

Many of the listeners are, lets be polite, not fully aware of this album's appeal...and fail to see beyond the obvious. Don't listen to these people. Don't get me wrong I like the smash hits from Purple, but there are far greater things if you JUST LISTEN.Meatplow instantly brings back memories of Core, I can just imagine the hippie student, massive Core fan, sticking in Purple and hearing the first few chords, 'whoa cool man'. Meatplow is nonetheless a good song with a very catchy hook, despite being a little too derivative. Unfortunately for our hippie friend he gets bombarred with some of the most melancholy, psychedelic and ultimately disturbing music to come out of the 90s. But hell, he doesn't know it.Lounge Fly is an excellent song- slow and brooding with visceral lyrics. Something the hippie will relish from this totally un-Core-ish album. Still Remains is the best song STP ever created, and one of my favourite songs of the genre. It's deceivingly dark, and portrays a difficult drug surfacing for Weiland with lyrics such as - 'If you should die first, ask if you could bring a friend' - Of course our generic American no-brainer (no digs honestly) won't pick up subtlety.The closer, Kitchenware & Candybars, not the hidden Led Zep cover that stinks, sums up Purple. K & C is a classic, it's just a fine, miserable, gloomy and depressive closer, leaving a dark and bitter taste in the mouth. But all in a good way.There are real psycho songs on here, such as Vaseline and Unglued which reflect the good side of drugs - the getting high bit. These songs are undoubtedly psychedelic, acting as nice contrasts to the rest of the serious tone.Purple is, on a whole, a very deep and moving album.

(Those `64-65 events were literally career-saving; Earl seriously considered quitting music altogether at the time.) Throughout the `70s-80s it seems that everyone wanted to record Hines; Hank O'Neal of Chiaroscuro probably had more opportunities than most and this is one of Fatha's best outings for the label. Hines became a much more expansive player during his later years, taking full advantage of the LP's longer time allowances. He often makes each tune almost a miniature concerto, changing tempos and even styles during a typical 5-8 minute performance. Sometimes the elaborate codas he employs go on for a number of minutes themselves, almost as if he doesn't really want to end playing the tune at hand until he's milked it of every nuance he can think of. He is a marvelously talented and inventive player, and on such tracks here as I'LL SEE YOU IN MY DREAMS, I'VE GOT A RIGHT TO SING THE BLUES, and BLUE SKIES his playing is both exuberant and majestic.

The question that comes to mind about this CD is ""Why didn't Eddie Harris record more ""straight-ahead"" jazz?"" Aside from SWISS MOVEMENT with Les McCann, you rarely hear one of his CDs that is all ""straight-ahead"". VEXATIOUS PROGRESSIONS falls into the ""straight-ahead"" catagory. It was recorded in 1994 in Portland, Oregon with local Portland musicians, and this studio recording has almost a ""live date"" feeling. It is a quintet format with the excellent Ron Steen on drums, Phil Baker on bass, and the piano worked shared by Peter Boe (two great solos on ""IGNOMINY"" [with its Art Blakey like horn riffs] and ""ESSENCE OF MATTER"") and Janice Scroggins. The trumpet player is the little known (outside of jazz circles) Thara Memory with his wonderful Clifford Brown/Blue Mitchell influences. All the songs are Harris originals which were most likely never recorded again. They seem to be tribute songs to famous contemporaries - ""THREE QUARTER MILES"" (an ""ALL BLUES"" by Miles take off), ""CEDAR TREES"" (Cedar Walton / Jazz Messengers), ""MONK'S MOMENT"" (Monk), ""SILVER PLATED"" (Horace Silver), and ""MY MAN ED"" (written in honor of Detroit D. J. Ed Love - thanks for the correction Maggie). Eddie Harris was once quoted as saying he wanted to be known as ""One of the baddest mother------- who ever played a saxophone."" Perhaps if Eddie had recorded more ""straight-ahead"" jazz, he would have been thought of that way. However, ironically, he was also quoted as saying ""Most people want me to play funk."" TOO BAD!

It would be nice to think that this was going to be a CD  which would blast across the current re-bop/smooth jazz scene and eradicate  the lameness, which is what the name of the CD implies, but such is not the  case. However, you do get some very subtle and well-thought out grooves and  some good compositions, and the interplay between the musicians is  impeccable.  This CD is not particularly as innovative or as  &quot;free&quot; as one might hope, but the Trio are agile, wry and  thoughtful in their explorations and there is very little &quot;been there  done that&quot; feeling in their music, as there is with many survivors of  the &quot;free jazz&quot;/&quot;avant-jazz&quot; movement of the late 60s  and early 70s.

Throughout the CD the mood is controlled, introspective. Tracks 1,2 (with piano),5 are mostly played at a very slow &quot;tempo&quot;, with long sounds played by both musicians, exploring each sound and its relation to the other sound/sounds.Track 3 is a short, more energetic tune with the musicians talking over background sounds. Track 4 is a little faster and more dense then the rest, but it is still nothing like &quot;energy playing&quot; I have heard before. There is always an emphasis on the sound, the spaces of silence, and the overall &quot;coloring&quot;.The first 3 compositions are by Jarman. He seems to use the tunes to express a feeling, or an idea. He uses lots of silence, as part of the tune (in the first two tunes)Braxton's two compositions are very intruiging and stimulating. He works on many level's simultanously, and manages to get such a great result... I just love his music so much.So, this CD is highly creative and original.

So, why did it take me so long to buy one of his albums?  Don't know, but I'm glad I did.

I heard nothing like Mantrica while there.  I purchased it just a couple of days ago here in the States.  It is trance inducing and dance inducing at the same time!  I have found it quite addictive.It builds to a middle rhythmic climax with 'Maha Mrtyunjaya Mantra', which smokes.  This piece would not be out of place in any dance club that plays trance or house, nor on any late night rock show on FM.  It then spools back down, finally arriving at 'Savasana', which translated apparently means Supreme Stillness.  Indeed.  This mededtative drone piece induces altered states of deep relaxation, but not no much so that you pass out while driving ;-)  The entire CD could be used as meditation music though.AJ uses many authentic Indian instruments and as stated above speaks Sanskrit for lyrics.  You don't have to understand Sanskrit to feel the energy provided by the songs.

I have these....and here are my findings.1.  They are awkward at first, as with any new skill you try when lifting weights.2.  Someone said he couldn't use his ""normal"" weight when doing incline press.....if you can do 90 lb incline press WITH DUMBBELLS then these hooks will NOT hamper your ability in doing incline presses with the same weight.  That doesn't even make sense.  However....if you never or rarely do certain exercises with dumbbells then yes, you will have to lower the weight...at first.  Anyone who lifts knows if you go from a bar to dumbbells then you will have to take time to get used to each arm lifting independently.3.  Yes....it will take a few times to get used to placing your bench just right under the bar that holds the hooks for you.  I do not bump the bar when using these.  And just like lifting on your own, without a spotter, with a barbell.....it's no different with dumbbells.  You need to be able to muscle them back up to hook the bar.4.  They are NOT made to be dropped!!!  They are made to hook on the bar when your set is done.  I read a review on here that complained that they get banged up or something when you drop the dumbbells.  Duh!  You wouldn't throw your barbell on the floor when you got done bench pressing, would you?  No....then why would you think you would throw these on the floor?  It doesn't make sense.  These hooks are designed to be placed BACK on the bar after your set...NOT thrown on the floor.5.  They are comfortable...to me.  Unless you don't find padded material comfortable, you will find them comfortable too.  Someone actually said that if you have big hands then you can't use these.  What?????  They fit ON THE HANDLE!  If your hands don't fit around a dumbbell handle then it's not the hooks fault.  They take up ZERO space on the handle, other than adding just a few centimeters in thickness around the handle.6.  In my opinion....they also help prevent shoulder injuries from trying to muscle up the dumbbells to their position.  There are a few videos on youtube demonstrating these hooks.  There is also one that shows how to use chains hanging from a power cage or from rafters in your basement hooked on to these as a spotting system in case you can't muscle them back up to rehang them back on the bar.  I have the chains hanging from the top of my power cage and attached to the hooks so I can go to exhaustion on my last set without the worry of dropping the weights on the floor.",5.0,I've had these for about a year.,1385769600,"11 30, 2013",Sports_and_Outdoors,1.0

Actually, it's a band in name only, singer/guitarist Quorthon being the only constant, while other members are pretty much just hired  guns.  Since 1983, Quorthon has been churning out original, experimental,  and often unlistenable variations on death and black metal.  Bathory is  considered one of the originators of both those genres, most of the extreme  Swedish and Norwegian black and death bands of the early 90s claiming  Bathory as prime influence.  Bathory's early material is pure thrash, fast  and trebly, riffs sounding like a vacuum cleaner, blastbeats totally out of  control.  Over this raging din, Quorthon screeched out unintelligible odes  to Satan, making him, along with Venom, Mercyful Fate and Slayer, one of  the earliest groups to really embrace Satanic imagery (much of which sounds  goofy today).  Gradually, Bathory embraced more intricate riffs and the  lyrics moved from Satan to Norse mythology (again, Bathory blazing the way  for future Scandinavian metal bands).  By the early 90s, the music had  slowed down to a medieval/doom, nearly mellow sound recalling Manowar.  All  the while, the production job was always pretty loose, with fuzzy guitar  and bass and drums that were either inaudible or too boomy.  This  compilation haphazardly covers all of it.  More than anything else, Bathory  gets credit for originality, true weirdness and a complete disdain for  mainstream sounds.",4.0,"inconsistent, but one of the true innovators of metal",946425600,"12 29, 1999",Sports_and_Outdoors,1.0

To be honest I'm pretty tired of 'The Gypsy Cried and 'Two Faces Have I, purely because I've heard them millions of times, but 'You may be holding my baby' and 'There they go' are two of the best records that I've listened to on a rock and roll CD for quite some time.Christie didn't follow suit with his amazing two tone voice and opt for the typical 'Italian Doo Wop' sound, instead he was usually backed by female singers known as The Tammys, which is a neat and individual touch. Although his number one hit, Lightening Strikes is missing - due to him changing labels before releasing it - this is probably the best CD to get by LOU CHRISTIE. I'm a fairly harsh critic, but although not every track is excellent, I can find little to criticise on this fine CD. Buy this one and then get the one with 'Lightening strikes' and his cover of 'Teenager in love' on.

His biographies inform us that a young Glenn Gould was mesmerized upon witnessing Josef Hoffmann in concert, and walked around in a kind of trance days afterwards. Well, I shared this experience during Cherkassky's concerts in the 80's, Hofmann, one of his teachers, could have been proud.Unfortunately, Cherkassky's quality of tone, about which libraries could be filled to little avail, is poorly reproduced in most of his recordings. His Nimbus discs are disastrous, his concert discs on Decca, Orpheo and BBS legends are decent, but offer very little in the way of the Cherkassky live experience. Fortunately, there is this disc that should be able to give an uninitiated listener at least some impression of the singing tone that the master could produce on any hall's standard issue.Just like Jorge Bolet, whose late Liszt cycle has endowed him with a distinctly better chair in the pianist pantheon, Cherkassky found his highest acclaim towards the end of a distinguished career. He started out a prodigy, found fame, was forgotten and survived under humble circumstances as the BBC house pianist, to reemerge in the 1980s and find well deserved acclaim.Whereas the likes of Ivo Pogorelich and Bruno Leonardo Gelber never failed to express the attitude ""my audience, I despise you""; never more so when one attempted to even approach their dressing room, Shura was the very opposite. He knew who he was and was the most pleasant of after concert personalities. I remember discussing the Beethoven/Liszt symphony transcriptions that Katasaris was recording at that time with him. He responded ""o, that is such a bad idea, those works don't work at all on a piano; and, ""the Liszt version of Berlioz' Symphonie Fantastique, now that is a much better idea"". However, my question ""have you ever played it"" only got one of his gentle ""are you crazy"" smiles in response.In his Cherkassky obituary Stephen Hough wrote: ""no one who heard him play or met him will ever forget his unique personality, both on and off the stage. His golden tone, like sunshine melting a bowl of the richest ice-cream (two of his 'favourite things'); his contrapuntal voicing, like a child wandering into all the rooms he's been banned from; or, for that matter, his walk to the piano - as if treading on crushed velvet. We will try to keep our memories fresh with his recordings (particularly the 'live' ones), and will treasure amongst ourselves the many anecdotes which have now become part of musical folklore. Although he never taught (""I wouldn't know how""), perhaps we can all learn from him the lesson that elegance and entertainment have their place in the concert hall as well as education and elevation; and that there is no shame in loving and cherishing the piano for its own sake.""And, although Cherkassky could wrap his arms around a Liszt sonata, the Tchaikovsky Sonata included on this disc, or other large scale works, his mastery was best attuned to both smaller scale works, or segmentable works like variations and paraphrases.It was in one of the after concert conversations that in response to a tease by what appeared a longtime friend Cherkassky responded ""well, look at my repertoire, it ranges from Lully to Stockhausen, and a lot of what is in between"". That was interesting, and after spending quite some time in those pre-internet days, I was disappointed to find out that there were no such things as Lully solo keyboard works. Two decades later, this disc came to the rescue.Technically this disc is so, so. It's a live concert with a lot of audience noise. There is tape hiss. Dynamics at the macro level are ok, on the micro level leave a lot to be desired, but timbre wise this disc is not bad at all.The concert starts with Lully. Now, in the internet age, I found out that the ""suite de Pieces"" that Cherkassky played is in fact the pianist's selections from an early 20th century transcription of Lully Opera pieces for the piano. Those interested should be able to find the score as a free download without trouble.In many interviews Cherkassky has admitted that sitting on a podium in front of an audience took him to a places that he would have never imagined during practice sessions, and that relistening to concert recordings often resulted in a ""did I really play it that way?"" response. Well, his Lully here is a fine example. Fine that is, for those who do not suffer from HIPP hang ups, since they may counter that Cherkassky's trance-like performance channels good old Beelzebub. But, and this is very relevant for Lully, the French state ""c'est le ton qui fait la musique"", and it is his pretty much unmatched tone control that enables Cherkassky's to open emotional doors, that don't budge for the great majority of his colleagues. Sure, one could remark that this performance -remember Hough's ""his contrapuntal voicing, like a child wandering into all the rooms he's been banned from"" - is pathologically anachronistic. But, that gently perfumed ""Air tendre"" represents the composer more credible than many a card carrying HIPP vinegar factory. To me, this Lully is amazing. And, admiration for this interpretation really blooms when one climbs behind the 88 with the score. Talk about artistic imagination.Mendelssohn's decidedly third-tier piano trifles were popular in Cherkassky's generation. He makes out of it what he can, but this Scherzo and Cappriccio has never impressed me.Next, we get to the meat and potatoes of this disc, the nowadays mostly forgotten Tchaikovsky sonata. It's sad Pjotr wrote so much great music, and yet when it comes to the piano all we hear is that mediocre 1st Piano Concerto war horse. In many respects, this sonata is much more interesting. Of course, a Hammerklavier it's not, but judged on its own especially melodic merits there is a lot to enjoy. The pianist has this music running through his veins and in all likelihood offers us a very close approximation of what Tchaikowsky had in mind. Not surprisingly, the interpretation is approached from the inside out, from detail to the whole -Leslie Howard offers an engagingly opposite approach. And, the romantically inclined among us will find a lot to enjoy in this neglected work.Next, there is Chopin's Op. 61, which may be considered among the composer's very best and most dramatic works. Although I don't want to imply that it represented a certain dislike of the dramatic, Cherkassky's performance here is in a much lighter vein than Ivan Moravec' standard performance. Just like he did in his Salzburg performance of Bach's 6th Partita, Cherkassky provides a more laid back approach that does not lack in validity. Chopin's masterpiece does lose some of its bite, but this lyrical approach successfully highlights the more subtle of the composer's modulations in a beautiful tone.Then there are two encores, an old school Chopin waltz that defines the word ""charm"" concludes the affair. Before that there is Hoffman's Kaleidoskop, that has been revived by Marc-Andre Hamelin. The Canadian is linear and metronomically incredibly perfect. Just like in Lully, Cherkassky dives into the piece, and uses his exquisite sense of coloring to get to this composition's true essence.Bolet and Cherkassky both enjoyed the label ""the last romantic"" at the end of their careers. Comparing them to today's highly homogenized lot turns even me nostalgic. Fortunately, this disc seves like the madeleine in ""&Agrave; la recherche du temps perdu"".",5.0,An adequate representation of a unique pianist,1401926400,"06 5, 2014",Sports_and_Outdoors,1.0

When I got the first one, I had just started their agility training.  To make it easy to use in a second, I just left it set up.  I used empty laundry soap or kitty litter jugs, filled with inexpensive litter and some water, for weights.  The first tunnel has been set up in my yard for two years now, in the south Florida sun and rain.  The only times I took it down was when high winds were predicted.  Except for slight color fading from the sun, it is in PERFECT condition!  The metal spring rings have not bent.  There are no rips or tears in the nylon fabric.  I got a less expensive one from a toy store last year, and it is not in as good as condition as the first one.  The reason for the additional purchase is to add length.  With 3, 6' tunnels, I have the option of having 3 short tunnels on a practice course or putting them together with velcro and having a long tunnel.

My little ones have had lots of fun crawling through but I bought this along with 2 of the tents and the tunnel doesn't actually hook to the tent. I had big plans for the setup in our playroom and was incredibly disappointed. For starters if you buy the tents there is no option for left side vs right side on where the tunnel hole is located so in order to connect them one tent must be facing one direction and the other tent facing in the other direction. This will be fine if we set them up outside this summer but don't plan on an inside setup against a wall....won't work. The tunnel apparently just has to nestle inside the hole in the tent because there is no way to fasten it. The minute my kids started crawling through it moved and was out away from the tent. If they take it easy this wouldn't be a problem but seriously what child is going to carefully and slowly crawl through. I'm not sure why they say &#34;you can set up a whole city&#34; because there's one door and one hole in the tent so unless you are using the door to prop your tunnel in you can only connect it with one tunnel. I was really disappointed in this and if I could do it over I wouldn't have bought these. I would have stuck with a cheapie pop up play hut.,3.0,Okay,1388275200,"12 29, 2013",Sports_and_Outdoors,0.0

It's cute, my wife loves it and emphasizes, tongue in cheek,  how much guys love gadgets, but these things really are useful!I own the  Garmin GPSIII and the new eMap. I have found these GPS units to be  extremely useful, competent and entertaining. I've used them for sailing,  vacations, business trips, commuting and motorcycling. For motorcycling, I  find using a GPS unit to be indispensable, especially when traveling in  unfamiliar areas. Pulling over to the side of the road to look at a map  requires taking off my gloves and helmet, which is time consuming and  frustrating. With a GPS unit, I can preprogram a 1,000+ mile trip and never  have to pull over to look at a map, never miss a turn, always know how far  and how long it will be to my next rest / fuel stop, etc. It's also nice at  the end of the day to precisely know how long you've been traveling (with  the eMap, your moving, stopped and total time), your average and top speed,  and miles covered. Should you have a problem requiring service, you can  communicate your exact location. If you have children, you can answer that  perennial question, ""are we there yet"" to the minute and tenth of a  mile.I was going to upgrade to the GPSIII Plus for its ability to import  maps from my computer but learned Garmin had produced a new model, the  eMap. Having had a GPSIII (i.e., GPSIII Plus without the maps) for years, I  knew how well made, reliable and valuable the unit is but was intrigued by  the eMap. The eMap is slightly lighter, definitely thinner and has a screen  that is 20% larger than the GPSIII Plus. It is also less expensive. I also  liked the fact that the eMap has memory cartridges in 8 or 16 meg sizes  whereas I've read that the GPSIII Plus has only 1.5 megs of internal map  storage (not upgradeable), considerably smaller. On the plus side for the  GPSIII Plus it is significantly more water-resistant (an absolute necessity  for water activities), your information can be displayed on a number of  different ""pages"" or screens and it is much more user  configurable.Although I love my new eMap, I'm not getting rid of my  GPSIII. As between the GPSIII Plus and the eMap, I would say this. For the  vast majority of people using a GPS, especially those new to GPS, the eMap  is THE handheld GPS to have. If things like VMG (""velocity made good"") are  important to you, if you want a unit that can be configured for a number of  specialized applications, if you aren't bothered by the memory limitation  of the GPSIII Plus, then I'd highly recommend that unit.

After a couple of minutes, she said to me, &quot;Mac, this is just a toy for men!&quot; I started to argue, but then I said, &quot;Ya'  know...you're right!&quot;But, what a useful toy (tool) it is!My  Background-------------I am a systems/software engineer currently  working on (trying to win a development contract for) the next version of  the Military hand-held GPS receiver. It is called DAGR (Defense Advanced  GPS Receiver, current version is called PLGR, Precision Lightweight GPS  Receiver).What we hear from our user groups (The soldiers) is that they  want Garmins. (A lot of them buy them with their own money!) I have to  agree with the soldiers. That's why I spent my own money on a III+.How I  Use My Garmin III+------------------------I have been using mine  (first a III, then I upgraded to a III+) for about 1.5 years. I have hiked,  biked, driven, and flown with it. I have the 3 Map CDs that are available  as well. (US Road, US Topo, World Major Roads)Here are some common ways  that I use mine...Navigating to an Address after getting the coordinates  from Mapblast.com------------------------------------------(1) Get  the coordinates of virtually any address in the U.S. (and UK) by going to  the &quot;Map&quot; section of  Mapblast([...]) and typing in the address.  You will get a map and the coordinates of the &quot;X&quot; that marks the  address of the address that you typed in. (2) Take your Garmin and create a  new waypoint with the coordinates from MapBlast. (3) Press the  &quot;Goto&quot; Button, select your waypoint, and the unit will give you  bearing and distance to your waypoint.(Note: The Garmin eMap allows you  to look up addresses on the unit (If you buy the data cartridge and Map  CDs), but it doesn't have nearly the configurabiltiy that the III+ has. I'm  waiting for the combination unit! Wireless connection to an address  database would work too! Then I won't need MapBlast (and a computer) to get  addresses.)Giving (Pretty) Accurate Estimated Time of Arrivals  (ETAs)-------------------------------------------------You can set up  your Garmin to display ETA based on your current speed and bearing. This  really only gives good estimates if you are traveling more or less in a  straight line to your destination or if you have input a route with all  your turns. I have gotten pretty good at estimating when I will arrive  somewhere, whether the distance is pretty large (ie: LA to SF) or small (20  miles or so).Marking Where the Car is  Parked.--------------------------------Whenever I hike or bike, I  mark the place where the car is parked before I head out on the trail.  Then, I set up the Garmin to point to the car. This way I always know how  far I am from the car.Also, I usually clear the track log (and the Trip  Computer) before I start out so that I can use the TrakBack feature to tell  me how far I am (actual trail distance) to the car or to direct me back, as  the case may be.Last Word---------I am very happy with my Garmin  III+.

I do family research and I use this to find cemeteries using the coordinates given in the GNIS lists. This is my first GPS and the 3+ has all the features I want. One of the best is your ability to rename fields to your liking. On the Position Page, the default sunrise field is not important to me but altitude is, so I renamed the sunrise field to altitude. Another is the big number feature on the Compass Page. It's great to see the big numbers(speed and distance to waypoint) when your driving down the road. The negative is the rocker bar. It's an oval rubber pad and if you have big fingers (like me) you sometimes change the existing selection up or down when you meant to go to the next selection. I would like to see 4 arrow keys. Accuracy with SA turned off is consistant 5-14 ft here in Alaska. The MOB function brought me back within 5' every time. Highly recommended accessories are the 12v cigarette lighter adapter and a training video. The manual is very clear but the video makes the operations a lot clearer.

On top of all this, I was extremely impressed on how well-built the casing is! Buttons feel very positive, and everything feels solid. The casing is also water-proof rated to 30ft (although I wouldn't recommend testing it).A notable downside to this unit is the VERY small memory space for the Mapsource maps. In most cases, it will only hold about one large city. If you live in a large city, you will be extremely limited. If you travel a lot and need more detailed road information (the basemap on the 3+ only has major highways and some local roads), I would recommend you get the Garmin eMAP Deluxe because it comes with a Mapsource cartridge that will allow you to put much more detailed area on your GPS plus the EMAP is designed more for the road.Overall, I would rate the GPS 3+ very high for anyone.",4.0,Best handheld GPS around except for one slight problem,948672000,"01 24, 2000",Sports_and_Outdoors,1.0

Most noticeably, an upgradeable map and waterproof case (mine  has neither). As a climber and backpacker, I haven't had much need for GPS.  A road map and road signs get me where I need to go. Once an unexpected  detour (car accident) made it nice to have so I could get around it on the  fly.  I have also used it for playing around trying to find  off-the-beaten-track short cuts. It would also come in handy for navigating  off the coast, marking dive sites and whatnot, but I have yet to use it in  that capacity. In the backcountry, I find a compass and topo much more  convenient. They are lighter and I don't have to worry about batteries. The  battery life is very short. Mine lasted about 8-9 hours. They claim 24-36h  on the new version. This in my opinion is still too short. It's definitely  a battery-eating monster at 4 AA batteries. I use mine mostly in the car.  You have to buy the car adapter separately. Even with improved accuracy,  with the US government turning off the built in error factor, I still find  GPS a toy. Unless you need to ocean navigate, are a traveling salesperson  or just want a cool toy, I'd save your money.  Otherwise, Garmin GPS III is  the top of the line GPS with great features if you need them.",3.0,Do you need GPS?,967161600,"08 25, 2000",Sports_and_Outdoors,0.0

The carpet comes folded and it can take time to work out the creases, but once flattened you are ready to grab a golf ball, your favorite putter, and start practicing.Probably the best feature of this Club Champ product is the ball return. It works well and continuously sends the ball back to you. I like that I can stand in one place and putt the ball over and over again. This makes it nice not just for putting practice, but also for kids who can entertain themselves without much frustration.It&#8217;s cool to have a way to practice one&#8217;s putting, but there are problems with this product that lead me to lower my rating. The biggest issue I have is with the construction. It is made about as cheaply as possible, apparently for maximum profits.

Great for practice putting when you are bored with everything else.  However, putting on your living room carpet is not at all like putting on an undulating green with grass on the course.  It is hard to maintain interest for even a avid golfer.The Club Champ Super Sized Electric Putt N' Hazzard Putting Mat changes that dramatically.  First off, it comes with carpet of its own similar to what you find on mini-golf courses, so you don't have the irregularities of the house carpet textures.  It is about 9 feet long so it gives you an opportunity to truly practice.  There are 3 destinations the putted ball can reach...the hole itself, a water hazard (no water), and a sand trap (no sand).  If it goes in any of the 3, the ball is kicked back to you, and it comes back with sufficient force to bring it back the full 9' distance.We found that by placing small objects under one or both edges you can make the putting more difficult by requiring the player to take the angles into account so it is not a straight putt any longer.  Also, we made the 9' runner into small hills to putt over...all the different layouts made it a fun game for the entire family.It comes with a &#34;&#34;3D&#34; background of trees, is simple to assemble, and high quality materials.

The putting mat is all one piece; there is no gap or attaching of the putting surface.  You just unroll it.  It's not the BEST surface; mine has been unrolled for days, but is still &#34;bumpy&#34; from where it was unrolled.  But, it's all one piece.  The only things you need to do is attach the tree-backdrop (velcro is used here), add a sticker for the bottom of the &#34;hole&#34;, and stick in the flag.  I noticed the instructions were not applicable to the putting green I received; the instructions talked about putting the ball-return in place, etc, but really this is plug and play.  I did notice a problem with the flag; the hole that holds it goes down into the ball-return area, so I just don't use the flag.  The neat thing about this is that if you mis-hit a ball into the &#34;water&#34; or &#34;trap&#34;, it feeds the ball into the center area and shoots the ball back at you.  It's a powerful ball-return; it seems to depend on where the ball is located once the ball-return kicks in.  Sometimes the ball would roll back off the mat, sometimes it would make it halfway.It functions just fine.  Even with the &#34;bumps&#34; in the mat, I still made good putts.  It's more of a neat toy than a serious practice device:  the hole has an incline just before it, so you have to hit the ball harder than you would normally.  I had some solid shots get hung up on the incline at the end.  Your mis-hits have to be gentle; I had a few roll up onto the back of the green and roll back down, blocking the path of future hits.  Sometimes balls would get hung-up on the ball return area.  I would just hit a second ball, and the ball-return would shoot them back out.For the most part, I would recommend this toy.  It's nice to not have to walk back and forth for every shot just to get your ball.  The green surface isn't the thickest I've seen, but it's OK.

And although Buddy is an inductee into the Rockabilly Hall Of Fame, he continues to be ignored by those empty-headed members of the board of the R&R; Hall Of Fame.This Collectables release pulls together two Roulette albums, tracks 1 to 12 from the 1957 LP ""Buddy Knox"" (Roulette 25003) and 12 to 23 from the 1958 LP ""Buddy Knox & Jimmy Bowen"" (Roulette 25048), with excellent sound and 3 pages of notes by Mark Marymont along with the original LP sleeve notes. In terms of their nationally-charting singles, the two albums included 4 of those billed as Buddy Knox & The Rhythm Orchids and 3 of their B-sides, 2 charting singles billed only as Buddy Knox, and 1 charting single and its B-side billed as Jimmy Bowen with The Rhythm Orchids. Their complete singles history, both charted and non-charted including Buddy's 2 hits with Liberty Records, is shown in the Comments below with an asterisk (*) preceding those included in this release.The fact that Buddy was the more talented and charismatic of the two was born out by the decision of Roulette to release simultaneous singles showing Buddy Knox with The Rhythm Orchids and Jimmy Bowen with The Rhythm Orchids, and the obvious preference of the fans for Buddy's material. That began with their first hit, Party Doll which was initially released in 1956 on their own label, Triple-D 798 billed as Buddy Knox with The Rhythm Orchids b/w I'm Stickin' With You billed as Jimmy Bowen with The Rhythm Orchids. After leasing it to Blue Moon 402 the strong showing regionally by both sides prompted Roulette to pick it up and then  split the sides into separate discs. Bowen's side, as Roulette 4001, reached # 14 Top 100 in March-April 1957 b/w Ever Lovin' Fingers (also charting at  # 63), while Party Doll, as Roulette 4002, surged to # 1 Top 100 and # 3 R&B; in the same stretch b/w My Baby's Gone.That simultaneous release pattern would continue more or less into 1958 and always the Buddy Knox sides came out ahead, as you will see from the results shown in the Comments.If you're looking for more of their charting sides I would highly recommend the 2-CD 61-track 1996 set from Sequel of the U.K.Buddy Knox sadly passed away after battling cancer at age 66 on Valentine's Day 1999.

As for difficulty riding... that is nonsense.  My daughter has been riding her Marvel since the age of 18 months unassisted.  Prior to doing it herself, we would bounce her along or she would lead him around the house.  But once she wanted to ride by herself she just did.  She herself bounces up and down and he moves right along.  Now at the age of 2 she is 35inches tall and 33lbs and she rides him even better.  She still does not put her feet on the foot rest as she just pushes off the floor... but when her legs are long enough, I am sure she will.  The toy is for age 2-5 and so I assume the height and weight range are variables in ease of use.  But I can attest that coordination is needed.  And nothing more than my 18month old could handle.

Their biggest scam is the ""Extended Versions"" series, which is just repackaged live albums.  No wonder CD sales are down.The CD contains tracks from all of the Italian PFM studio albums from the seventies.  Some of the PFM albums were reworked for the English market with new English lyrics written by Pete Sinfield, of early King Crimson.  However, none of those English versions are included on this set.  I prefer the Italian versions, as the English lyrics were dumb, and the group did not speak English or understand what the lyrics meant.I would recommend buying one of the early PFM CD's, like Impression de Septembre instead of this and seeing if you like it.

On &quot;Riot Riot Upstart&quot;, the background music is purposely muffled a lot. Sure, it is like that on pretty much all Agnostic front CDs but this was much more muffled than usual. Not to mention it wasn't really that hard either. The simplicity, muffledness and lightness in the background music really leave something to be desired. The vocals on the other hand are as loud as ever. In fact the lead singer seemed to be focusing more on singly loudly then singing well on a lot of the songs. The lyrics aren't that great either. They have the same lyrical flaw that a lot of their earlier work did. That flaw is that the lyrics really only apply to people in New York. Not everywhere. If you don't live in New York, most of the songs have nothing at all to do with the society you know of. Either that or it is about being a skin head which also doesn't apply to me.

I recently bought a Leatherman Wave tool...try to compare the two and give an honest opinion about the quality and the practicality of the two. The finish and the built quality of the Swiss tool is much better than the Leatherman. There is really a big difference here. The Vic. Swiss Army tool has a bigger and smoother pliers. The Leathermans Wave tool has too many small useless low quality bits without locking system. The Victorinox tool has an excellent smooth locking system that keeps the bit you use in place (think safety). The Swiss tool was designed to make it easy to open the bits you want to use. On the other hand, I have to figure out how to open the small bits in the Leathermans. You open one of the bits you don't want just to open the one you want hoping there is enough friction between the two bits (poor design).The truth I returned the Leatherman Wave...because there is a big big difference between the two tools. The only good thing in the Leatherman is the metal file...The Swiss saw is an efficient fast great wood saw. Gerber new models may compete with Swiss Tools but The steel seems to be brittle and prone to breakage. I bought an extra (new version) Swiss Tool...The balistic pouch is of low quality...The tool is still high quality Swiss made.

Gnoza ""polishsumgai""","[1, 1]","I used to carry a well known name brand multitool until I found THREE superior options ( my decision was based on 40+ years as a fire fighter, police officer and bomb disposal technician ( EOD ). I have owned a number of multitools over the years and abused them all ( that's why the good ones have a lifetime warranty ). The three best for the money in my opinion are the 1. SOG Powerlock , 2. Victorinox SwissTool and 3. SOG Pocket PowerPlier - don't waste your money on anything else - no other multitool can come close to a SOG or Victorinox in performance, functionality and warranty. I do own other brand multitools and have a desk drawer full of them and they are used solely for opening envelopes and packages. When I need a multitool at work I want a `real' multitool that I can depend on to do the job at hand - the following 3 are my choices, depending on the assignment.The first rescue multi-tool worth your money is a SOG Powerlock ( various models are now available to suit your needs - "" including the assisted opening ""). I prefer the S66 because of the tool / implement selection. This folding tool isn't new, a fact that speaks to its highly regarded Compound Leverage mechanism that generates twice the pressure and gripping power of lesser tools. To wit: this thing is the Jaws of multitools. Beyond strength, you'll love the pivoting handle covers that really do improve comfort and dexterity. All the essential tools are intricately positioned for deployment and for you showoffs out there, the PowerLock's ability to open with a quick flick of the wrist is undeniably cool. The PowerLock features removable, pivoting handle covers that improve the comfort profile for your hand. More pressure can now be exerted on those tough jobs! Like the rest of the family in the series, the PowerLock can be opened and closed with a one-handed flip of the wrist. This is a basic requirement from SOG as so often one is holding wires or standing on a ladder and does not have both hands free. All tool components are easy to access and lock in the open position. The Phillips even locks in two open positions. With one of the simplest and safest locking devices ever engineered, just press the back of the lock and close the component into the handle. Included components in the S66 include a plier / gripper, 3"" straight blade, 3"" serrated blade,3 sided file,large screwdriver, Phillips screwdriver, small screwdrive, medium screwdriver, can opener, bottle opener, ""V"" cutter, wire crimper, blasting cap crimper, compound leverage, comfort grips, rulers and lanyard ring. The PowerLock also comes with a heavy-duty, dark leather pouch. A standard design issue with any SOG multipurpose tool is the advantage of it's hex bolt construction. This essential design element gives you the greatest versatility to clean and change tool components ( additional tool components are directly available from SOG for a modest charge) - with hex bolt construction holding the SOG's together - replacing tools is a snap. The SOG features all stainless steel construction ( also available in a black oxide finish #B66) and comes with a heavy duty leather pouch, a Lifetime Guarantee and they are MADE IN THE USA. Street price is around $55.00.The second multitool in the lineup is a Victorinox SwissTool which comes equipped with both a plain edge AND a serrated blade / seat belt cutter which can be life saving in a auto accident.  Victorinox Swisstools are quality unsurpassed , as are ALL of the lineup of Swiss Army Knives. The implements on the SwissTool are well thought out, each tool is individually accessible and locks securely in place. The knife blades are scary sharp and probably the sharpest of any production line knife made today, plus they are stainless steel. The heftyness of the tool speaks of it's quality, ruggedness and ability to do the job. I have broken the plier head jaws on several other manufacturers multitools , never on a Swisstool, including the smaller Swisstool Spirit, they are made to last a lifetime. I have had occasion to send Swiss Army Knives t Made in Switzerland with a lifetime warranty. Street price around $50.00.My most recent addition to the ""Best of the Best multitools "", the third, in my arsenal of multitools and I find it adequate to do 99% of the jobs handled by the two mentioned above. Lighter and more compact than the SOG PowerLock, its big brother, the Pocket PowerPlier ( Model #S44 ) is very easy to carry and use. SOG's Pocket PowerPlier is packed with essential tools that include pliers/grippers, wire cutters, partially serrated blade, Phillips screwdriver, three-sided file, can opener with a small screwdriver, bottle opener with medium screwdriver, an awl, rulers, lanyard and heavy duty leather pouch. Again the PPP's advantage of hex bolt construction leaves all the other multitools running for cover as this essential design element gives you the greatest versatility to clean and change tool components ( additional tool components are directly available from SOG for a modest charge) not offered by other multitool manufacturers. With the interchangability you can replace the partially serrated blade with a 3"" plain edge blade and I also removed the 3 sided file and replaced it with a serrated line cutter. I find carrying the PPP a benefit because of less weight hanging on my belt ( 5.5 ounces vs 9.6 ounces for the PowerLock) . Also noted is SOG's Deluxe Pocket PowerPlier ( Model S45) whichs adds a large screwdriver, 1/4 socket drive however it loses the awl as a tool and weighs in at 5.5 ounces - same as he S44 model.

All have their pluses and minuses, all have at least one ""cool"" factor, as well as one or more questionable design choices. But if I had to pick just one, it would be the SwissTool.The SwissTool is not sexy, like Leatherman's ""Wave"" or their new ""Charge"" series. It doesn't have spring-loaded jaws that pop out at the touch of a button, like the Gerber ""Recoil"". And it doesn't have geared jaws like the SOG.However, what the SwissTool is, is jaw-droppingly precise, gorgeous, and superbly executed. The stainless steel is polished, not matte or roughened. Each tool is easy to get out, slides out by itself (not in a clump), and has just the right amount of friction. The fingernail nicks are positioned very well, so that you don't need another tool just to open this one. Once the tool is out, it locks into place so firmly you can tell you'd break the tool before the lock itself would fail. And when you need to put the tool back, the unobtrusive spring-loaded release lets you fold the tool back with no effort.While this page seems to list the basic SwissTool, when I ordered it, I received the RS model, which is the one I wanted anyway. The RS model does away with the metal file, metal saw, and serrated blade, and replaces it with scissors, and what Victorinox calls a ""seatbelt cutter"", which is a very sharp, curved serrated blade.As I said, I collect multitools, and none comes close to the individual tool precision, polished fit-and-finish, and comfortable heft of the SwissTool.

Fee,"[0, 0]","Having had many Swiss Army Knives (Victorinox Multitools) in my scouting days I knew about Victorinox's quality. However, they became relegated to my knife drawer (it's a sickness, I know) because of more useful multitools (Leatherman, SOG, etc.). I've never been impressed by Gerber's fit/finish and mystery knife steel, have been impressed by SOG's toughness/compound pliers but never purchased, and became dissatisfied by Leatherman's fit/finish/QC. When saying I have owned/handled many brands of multitools, I mean it!As I work in an industrial environment as a maintenance mechanic, am married and father of two girls, and a general handyman, I use my tools all the time and take them very seriously.  While I use them heavily, I don't abuse them.I used to be a loyal Leatherman customer, having owned a Leatherman Kick, Core, Super Tool 300, a couple of Style CSs, and owned and/or given away more Micras than I can count.  Then I bought a Core because it was on clearance in a chain sporting goods retailer (they were clearing them out to make room for the Super Tool 300).  Within 1 month, I cracked the frame while bearing down on a bolt and broke the smallest screwdriver trying to back out a small screw (I used a cheap pocket screwdriver to ultimately back out the screw). My older Leatherman Kick has survived much more! I bought a Super Tool 300 to take its place while it was being serviced. The fit/finish was so poor that I returned it immediately.Now for the actual review. Amazon has some impressive prices on this multitool from time to time, and they are worth every penny. I liked mine so much, I bought two more as gifts for the excellent price offered at the time (51% off list price). I would have preferred the X, as it comes with scissors instead of the serrated blade, but it was $15 more. The Swisstool is definitely heavy duty, and does not ride comfortably in the pocket.  Good thing it comes with a good quality sheath.You really have to this tool in your hand to understand why everyone raves about the fit, finish, and ridiculous amount of engineering that went into this product. For instance, each 'secondary' tool is accessible from the outside when the pliers are closed, have their own dedicated spring (sized according to anticipated amount of use), and lock into place with a precision not seen in any other multitool.  It came lightly coated in a clear, odorless, rust-resistant oil (especially in the pivot points) which I deem unnecessary because of the tool's amazing rust resistance. I work in an environment where water and peroxide are everywhere, and this tool has not rusted one bit (another advantage over the Leatherman). I use most of the tools on a regular basis and love most of them!Now for the cons. A minor one is that the picture on Amazon doesn't accurately portray the product. Vicorinox stopped engraving the plier heads and putting the red sticker on the handle as a cost saving measure (Leatherman has too on their value multitools). The major disadvantage of the Swisstool is that it has blunt-nosed pliers. I do occasionally miss the needle-nose profile of my Leatherman. If you want a multitool with excellent quality, needle-nose pliers, and a smaller form factor, everyone seems to love the Swisstool Spirit series.In conclusion, if you find one of these on sale @Amazon, buy one! You won't regret it. A coworker of mine liked his so much that when his got stolen (he got it as a Christmas gift from his kids), he bought another one for $120!

I have also used a gerber multi-tool but I didn't like it near as much as my Wave.Once I replaced my Wave I felt the Victorinox was just a slightly more expensive tool, but it has proven to be much more. I have used it at least twice a week (many times much more often) for the past ten years and it still feels great. The tool closes and stays closed all the blades still lock and are easy enough to remove. The driver set still works great, though many of the bits have been replaced due to wear and tear. The nylon pouch is tearing and is almost ready to be replaced, but this is to be expected after ten years of wearing this tool on my belt. The only problem I have with this tool is that many of the tools are difficult to unfold due to their recessed fit, but this is negligible especially in most cases since this is the tool to use when you don't have access to real tools. It has saved me on many occasions when my bike breaks down away from home, or anything else that needs a quick tweak.

My grandpa brought back my first one from Switzerland in the early 1980s. At that time, Victorinox swiss army knives were not to be found stateside. The quality blew away anything we had in the states at the time.Before I got this, I got an original Leatherman, figuring I'd give my fellow countrymen a chance before looking to imports. This tool simply blows the Leatherman away in every category except one: weight. It is an absolute brute compared to the original Leatherman.Closed, it is 4-1/2"". It seems to weigh about half a pound. Mine came with a belt sheath that can be worn either horizontally (yay) or vertically. (yawn)Coming from a Leatherman, the first thing I noticed is the high-gloss finish Victorinox put on this baby. It is the same as is on their knives. Just top quality througout. Don't get bent out of shape because it takes fingerprints so easily. It doesn't matter, because it WILL NOT rust. (this is unconditional with Victorinox, unlike with many others)The next thing I noticed was the larger bulk. After that, I noticed that ALL the tools lock, and lock solidly; not just locked from closing on one's fingers.After that, I noticed that all tools except the pliers are on the outside of the knife when it is in the closed position. Therefore, when one needs a tool besides the pliers, there is not even the need to open the pliers. (unlike with the original Leatherman)This is the real handyman's multi-tool. Much beefier pliers than the original Leatherman. There are no one-handed blades, like on the newer Leatherman Waves, but that is not what this knife is about. (it should also be noted that the one-handed opening blades on the Leatherman Waves are not actually that fast to open, as they are so tight & with small opening slots)Most of the tools are simply the same or a bit larger than on typical swiss army knives. Tools that I was pleasantly surprised with:- #2 Phillips screwdriver: is long enough to be useful- Small flathead screwdriver: it was a surprise to see this little gem on such a big tool- Metal file: Can be surprisingly useful for fine-tuning the fit on things, whether plastic or metal. The metal saw is a last resort kind of thing. The file is also useful for deburring sharp edges off of things.- Chisel: While I don't use the chisel much, this tool also has two sharp wire stripping notches in its base. These are not the joke wire strippers like are included on the bottle openers. These are for real.- Bottle opener/flathead screwdriver: This has been lengthened to make it feel more like a real screwdriver and less like a bottle opener.- Large flathead screwdriver: This is truly large and sturdy enough to be used on the biggest flathead screws. It feels sturdy enough that one could probably do some real prying with it.- Wood saw: I rarely cut wood with this, but it is also useful for cutting plastic. I cut more plastic these days than wood.- Scissors: As many of you already know, this tool is second only to the blade for usefulness. I'm glad Victorinox didn't gyp us out of this.The only thing to watch out for on this tool is the size & weight. Be sure you're willing to carry a big, beefy tool. The big quality and functionality are there too. If you don't want to carry a big, beefy tool, I recommend getting a medium sized swiss army knife with the pliers blade, and realize that it is for comparatively light duty.",5.0,They've beat Leatherman at their own game!,1259366400,"11 28, 2009",Sports_and_Outdoors,1.0

I've been carrying this knife with me just about wherever I go for the past four years or so - it is fantastic. It's not great at any specific things, and can never substitute for a good toolbox or specialty tools, but it can do a lot of different things, and it saves so much time to just have this with me for the quick, light-duty tasks that I encounter. While I was an undergraduate student, this tool plus a hammer served as most of my on-the-cheap dorm room toolkit, and served quite effectively.Compared to other multitools I've seen, I'm particularly pleased with how sturdy this knife feels and has proven to be, how every single blade is accessible with the pliers closed, and how securely /all/ of the blades lock. Also, while this is now a fairly common feature among multitools, this knife was one of the first to think of actually rounding the edges of the metal on the side that you grip for the pliers, so that you don't kill your hands if you're holding something tightly.The lock for the blades is a slide that springs into place whenever you open any of the blades. Most multitools only have a couple of the blades lock, which seems silly to me - I'm providing more downward pressure when using the dull-edged screwdriver blades, so while I'm not going to cut off a finger with philips head, it's still at least as valuable to have that lock as the main blade. To close the blades, you have to pull and hold the spring lock back. I've never had the lock disengage on its own (and I've treated it quite harshly).Unlike some Leathermans and Gerbers, there are no screws that you can tighten should anything become loose. However, I have never had that problem with this tool. It still feels just as tightly riveted as it did when I first got it.The only actual negative I have for this knife is that, while the edges one holds for the pliers are rounded, they're also smooth steel - which means that a sweaty or greasy hand will start to slip the tighter you grip. It's not practical to create finger holds or similar on a compact tool such as this, but Victorinox could very easily just roughen that rounded edge a bit, instead of letting them be perfectly smooth.Also one point of maintenance: every few months, I need to add a little light lubricating oil to the joints for each of the two sets of blades, otherwise they start to stick (such that pulling out one blade may start to also pull out the blade next to it).

This is one fine tool.In the past Victorinox knifes didn't have a locking blade and this one doesn't have that drawback. All the blades lock so, for example, you can put pressure on the screwdriver and it won't snap shut on you.I haven't used this one too much so if there are any weaknesses I couldn't tell you what they are. I do have another Swiss Army knife and it has been very durable.Possible negatives are that this tool is made of stainless steel. That's good for corrosion but I have used the metal saw on nails, just because the size was right for the job, and the teeth start to wear quikly. Stainless steel is just not as hard as plain old carbon steel. Maybe they could use titanium but that would drive the cost up. I certainly wouldn't want them to use plain old carbon steel because rust would be almost unavoidable. Stainless is probably the best choice.One thing I have to mention is the factory edge on the blades. They come razor sharp. You couldn't get them any sharper and even though they are not high carbon steel they hold there edge very well. You will eventually have to sharpen them but you will get some use out of them first.This tool has the things you probably need the most; knives, screwdrivers, can opener, metal saw, metal file, awl, reamer, scraper, ruler, pliers and wire cutter.What it doesn't have are: scissers, wood saw, magnifying lens, toothpick, tweasers, corkscrew, fish scaler and maybe some others that the regular knives might have.OK,OK: I WAS WRONG, IT DOES HAVE A WOOD SAW.Thank You Borys.",5.0,Victorinox quality and Leatherman versitility,1142726400,"03 19, 2006",Sports_and_Outdoors,1.0

E Jackson,"[4, 4]","Don't Call Us We'll Call You is definitely not a masterpiece like the first two Sugarloaf albums are, but the songwriting still maintains a decent level of quality, not to mention a few minor classics.  I guess my only complaint (which isn't *that* big of a deal really) is that instead of the raw production of the first two albums, now Sugarloaf sounds like they're going for a more commercial sound thanks to the clean way the album was recorded.  Probably just a reflection of the way rock music was progressing throughout the 70's, however.""I Got a Song"" is a pretty good ballad similar to many other bands from the early 70's, such as Dan Fogelberg and Loggins & Messina to name a couple.  Some of the piano playing is really nice.  A song I consider a true underrated masterpiece is the next one titled ""Myra, Myra"".  Listen to that furious keyboard jam!  It all leads up to a magnificent chorus.  Just a really remarkable song.  I wish it was longer than 5 minutes to be totally honest.  Those keyboards alone prove that Sugarloaf was no ordinary rock band.  Definitely more deserving than being tagged as a 2-hit wonder.""Lay Me Down"" is another really good one.  Perhaps it's overlong by a few minutes, or perhaps not.  It does keep my attention the entire time despite a relatively straight forward vocal melody and predictable, brief guitar solo.  The orchestratation at the end is really pretty.The title song is really weird.  Implementing the sound of phone buttons being pressed as a way to follow along to the rhythm and drums is a really neat idea, and dare I say, even a melodic idea?  CAN such a thing be melodic?  Well it sure sounds like it!  For some reason the vocal melody reminds me of 10cc.  At least, whenever 10cc liked to write fairly normal songs, it would occasionally resemble this kind of pop writing.  Meanwhile ""Round and Round"" is a pretty standard, but harmless track.Most of the other tracks like ""Colorado Jones"" blend together because they feel like relatively simple, typical early 70's rock songs, but they are undeniably melodic and delightful to hear regardless of their similar style.Overall, well I highly recommend you pick up that Sugarloaf/Spaceship Earth ""two albums on one disc"" deal floating around amazon.  That album is filled up entirely with some really amazing songwriting.  However, for those curious to explore further, this isn't a bad album either.On a completely unrelated note, I find it interesting that Sugarloaf were formed in Denver.  I went to Denver on vacation one time and really enjoyed my time there.  I even occasionally have beautiful dreams whenever I think about the mountains and streams out in the country.  Just really weird I'd have a connection to both Colorado and Sugarloaf's music, even if Sugarloaf doesn't necessarily make me think about Colorado.",4.0,"still sugary sweet... well I mean, still good!",1295568000,"01 21, 2011",Sports_and_Outdoors,1.0

They helped me to realize that Johnny Mathis was something more than just a romantic ballad singer.  He has an unmatched ability to convey every single heartfelt line of a soul stinging ballads while putting an upbeat flavor to some unexpected swinging standards.  Even in his seventies, he still sings and comminicates each song he sings.  My lady and I saw him live last year.  I am now eagerly searching for the rest of the CD's to match all of the classic Mathis vinyl that I own.

Two Johnny Mathis albums for less than what we pay for the new stuff. Someone at Sony marketing has definitely dropped the ball on this album. Why it is so difficult to find is beyond me. This is nowhere near the usual one hit plus twenty cut outs or ""B"" sides you usually get in one of these twofers. This album set hits the spot like a ""balmy breeze on a night in May"" or ""like a cool mint julip on summer day."" Johnny Mathis ""hits a new high in my estimation."" In a word everything about this collection is Superb. The voice,the music,the arrangements,the style. Superb.Superb.Superb.Superb. To be sure there are a couple of old chestnuts in here with Moon in June type intros and all, but Mathis makes them new,I mean new today,2005 new. Please do not forget that these albums are over forty years old and some of the songs are SIXTY and SEVENTY years old but we're still talking about them! Resist, if you can, singing along with ""Sweet Lorraine"",""You Hit the Spot"",""Like Someone In Love"",""This Heart of Mine"" or my fave up tempo tune,""Can't Get Out of This Mood."" I sing along to some songs I've never liked,(I'm an old Doo Wop rock and roll guy.) nor can I sing a lick...but then Mathis makes us all think we can sing, doesn't he? Resist the urge to get up and waltz around to ""While We're Young.""(This aint' your father's Nelson Eddy stuff.) Listen to how he moves up and down the register, from high ""Irish Tenor"" like to mid baritone, effortlessly, flawlessly. Hell,the guy isn't singing, he is playing his voice as though a Stradivarius. ""I'm Glad There Is You"" may induce chills in some. Listen to the other ballads like ""By Myself"" and ""Then I'll Be Tired of You"". Some think he sometimes imitates others; He doesn't imitate,he pays homage to those that came before him. Does the last sentence in ""My One and Only Love"" sound a little ""Sassie""? ""I'm Glad There is You,"" and ""There Goes My Heart"" are superb demos of smooth and easy. Finally, I could wax on and on, but in my humble opinion the best of the best is the title song, ""Warm"".This number alone is worth the price of admission. Where has this song been? I've never heard it before. This is a beautiful ballad right out of the fifties, early sixties;It sounds like a title song from a movie ala ""The Best of Everything"" and Mr. Mathis let's it all out here. Again Music,style,voice, it just doesn't get any better than this. Listen to this ballad with your ""other"" and Fall In Love All Over Again! Pick up more than one copy because your friends will want it. I sure hope Johnny Mathis is still making royalties on these two albums because this is what MUSIC is supposed to be.

The songs are an almost 40 minute version of The Song Is You (which was release in an edited version on the original LP) and a 17 plus minute version of Cherokee.I pulled it out recently because I had read that it had had an influence on Braxton's solo recordings of the seventies. I had forgotten just how unusual this recording is.It doesn't sound like any of Braxton's solo work that I know of, nor that of Urs Leimgruber nor Roscoe Mitchell nor anyone else that I know of who plays solo saxophone these days. The closest relative to these recordings I can think of is some of the solo recordings that Sonny Rollins has done over the years.Konitz is a melodicist of infinite variety with beautiful tone. I always expect on a record like this to get bored by the end of a song but even on The Song Is You this never happens. Konitz just unfolds melodic variation after variation with an ease that makes it all sound logical.The effect is similar to when I read a novelist who introduces a plot twist that I did not see coming but which makes perfect sense. If you are already a Konitz fan or a fan of the solo saxophone than this recording should be part of your collection.One last note- Konitz's sound on this recording does somehow convey lonliness.

It is a reissue of a 1970 D'Oyly Carte LP called ""Songs and Snatches.""  It included all the music here, sans the 1973 Mikado excerpts (more on that below).The selections are all solos or trios, which explains some of the unusual (though never unwelcome) selections.  A cast list is not given in the booklet, but may be found by searching online for ""D'Oyly Carte Songs and Snatches.""The most important aspect of this album is the preservation of Phillip Potter's Luiz and Richard Dauntless.  He was a wonderful singer with one of the most beautiful tenor voices I've heard (I've had family members say, ""Wow, his voice is beautiful. Who is he?"").  Potter's Dauntless doesn't have as much character as Derek Oldham or Leonard Osborn, but the voice is so very lovely, it doesn't really matter.And speaking of matter, it would have been wiser to include the Matter Trio (with Peggy Anne Jones, perhaps) rather than *another* version of ""There grew a little flower.""  The DOC was wise to include ""The battle's roar,"" which shows off one of their most musically sensitive artists very well.  He is well-backed by Julia Goss in her first D'Oyly Carte recording.John Reed is in decent shape, but the decline in his voice is apparent, particularly in the Iolanthe excerpts.  The bell-like clarity of ""When I went to the bar"" that marked his 1960 recording has vanished by this point is his distinguished career.  He badly fluffs a few words near the end of the Nightmare song, leading one to wonder why Decca didn't offer him a retake.  Still, he is quite himself.Sandford is still in excellent shape.  It is also good to hear Peggy Anne Jones in a role other than Pitti-Sing.Anne Guthrie and Thomas Lawlor's ""None shall part us"" is pretty bad.  Neither sound at all comfortable with what they're singing.  The Sansom/Styler (1960 D'Oyly Carte) or Morison/Cameron (1958 Sargent) pairings were much more successful.  ""Then one of us will be a queen"" is similarly uncomfortable, mostly on account of Guthrie and Lawlor.The sound quality is very good, though the miking is close.Seasoned G&S; nuts will rightly observe that the Mikado excerpts appear to come from the1965 G&S; Spectacularwith Sir Malcolm Sargent conducting.  Somehow, however, Decca managed to put tracks from theThe 1973 D'Oyly Carte Mikadoon there instead.  A pity Colin Wright's ""A wand'ring minstrel I"" wasn't omitted in favor of Valerie Masterson's ""The sun whose rays.""  Oh well.  (My feelings about this recording are in a review on the page linked.)  If you do want the G&S; Spectacular, all but the Pinafore excerpts were released with the boring1971 DOC ""Phase 4"" Pinafore.Overall, this is a interesting souvenir of the D'Oyly Carte as it headed into its decline, but cannot be a top recommendation for anyone looking for only one or two Gilbert and Sullivan discs.",3.0,A Variable Rarity for G&S Nuts Only,1294704000,"01 11, 2011",Sports_and_Outdoors,0.0

But the same Niels Winther capitulated when guitarist Dave Stryker demanded having organist Larry Goldings on his ""Blue Degrees"" album. Next SteepleChase recording artist out to persuade producer Niels Winther for an organ date was the excellent guitarist Doug Raney (son of the legendary guitarist Jimmy Raney) who has been living and recording in Denmark for more than 20 years and with the same number of solo albums for SteepleChase under his belt. Doug Raney is probably most known for his excellent guitar work with likes of NHP, Chet Baker, Jesper Tangaard and Bernt Rosengren, but also his classic duo albums with father Jimmy Raney.Doug Raney's impressive guitar skills and technique both as a soloist and accompanist with full bodied crisp chording, makes Raney a perfect jazz organ guitarist with a very personal sound. Pity it took him 20 years to make his first organ date with organist Joey DeFrancesco - the only organist he wanted to record with for this album according to producer Winther. To complete the trio Raney gave the drumsticks to Billy Hart whom he recorded with at his first SteepleChase album in 1977. Pairing Billy Hart's drumming with a Hammond B-3 organ, magic happens instantaneously - also on ""The Backbeat"".  The trio takes us through standards like ""Love for sale"", ""Prelude to a kiss"" with great authority and improvising skills in respect to the compositions. Then the trio turn into originals from both father and son - ""Jimmy James"" and ""Lee"" (tribute to Lee Konitz) - both tunes with attractive melody lines and changes that gives a lot of space for both Raney and DeFrancesco, where the organ is kept tastefully in the background through Raney's LONG solos (not on minute to short...) then to explodes into single line solos that only DeFrancesco can do.  Herbie Hancock, Dexter Gordon and Horace Silver penned the last three lesser known compositions - ""Driftin"", ""The BackBeat"", ""Purple Eyes"" - to complete this 65 minutes hard swinging trio album. One interesting observation on this recording is how sparse DeFrancesco is using the drawbar registration possibilities on the organ.Excellent album and a good starting point to explore the recorded guitar artistry of Doug Raney.",5.0,At last Raney recorded with a Hammond B-3 organ.....,1203120000,"02 16, 2008",Sports_and_Outdoors,1.0

It's easily my favorite musical style, and it's frustrated me that nobody has ever tried to write any sort of progressive song using simple, direct 3 chord harmony (The best kind, after all ^_^)NOFX are in the enviable position of playing to an audience who probably has never listened to Jethro Tull or Genesis, so the concept of an 18 minute song that doesn't ... is likely to rock their worlds.  But The Decline is more than just a stunt... it's got about 3 or 4 totally amazing songs inside of it, all melded together into one kickass movement.  The band put so much effort and energy into this album that it grabs you by the head and shakes, giving you just enough ""breather passages"" not to deaden the impact of the whole piece.  There's a climactic moment about 4-5 minutes in that knocked me off my feet.Complaints?  Well, the recurring trombone line doesn't seem to fit. It's like the band said ""Hey, a trombone! That's neat! Throw it in!""  And as for the lyrics, there are some patches that are just brilliant (""Where are all the stupid people from? And how'd they get to be so dumb?""), and a lot that sound too much like some high school student railing against the evils of the government like he just found his first philosophy textbook.But random yelling at the establishment is kind of to be expected in this style of music (otherwise, the more thuggish fans wouldn't approve, and we can't have that can we?).

Eliot threw a bunch of unconnected quotes and social commentary onto paper and called it The Waste Land, it was hailed as genius by a bunch of literary critics who probably had no clue what Eliot was talking about. When my English teacher tried to teach it in highschool, I fell asleep. Some eighty years later, NOFX pulls together different musical styles and their own social commentary and creates the 18-minute ballad The Decline, which is unlike anything I've ever encountered in punk music. This is punk rock poetry, a melodic hardcore musical masterpiece, and other contradictions all wrapped up in one. In true NOFX fashion, the band went out of their way to be as confusing and surprising as they could possibly be, putting the entire album in one track on a mostly clear CD (that's right, as in see-through). Lyrically, it's loaded with plays-on-words, metaphors, and inside jokes, and even the music has some instances where the band mocks its old material. Covering every range of speed, melody, and sound, NOFX accomplishes exactly what they're best at: being completely unpredictable. The album opens with the same hardcore tone that &quot;So Long and Thanks...&quot; did, but manages to wrap around and apply tons of different styles that the band has tried, and even some that they haven't. Even though I'm biased when it comes to NOFX (if they took a poop in a jewel box I'd probably give it a good review), the album seems to be getting a good response from those who have heard it, and it seems safe to say that this is a step up from their two most recent albums.

One song, one CD, 18 minutes and 21 seconds of the most amazing lyrics and musical technicality in punk today.  No one in punk is really as accomplished or as talented as El Hefe these days when it comes to guitar.  I have yet to see any band in history match Fat Mike's powerful lyrics and excellent bass riffs.  The usually-underrated Erik Sandin on drums is one of the best and fastest drummers I've ever heard (and he only uses one pedal).  There are so many different things going on at once and so many different parts of the song where they combine past and present techniques, it's impossible to list them all.  And did I mention the lyrics are LOADED with puns, hidden meanings, and messages about the society, government, drugs, guns, etc.  So many different aspects of this add up to the best punk song ever.

I mean, they're not bad, but I've heard better stuff before.  Anyways, now that that's out of the way, let me tell you this: The Decline is easily the best punk song ever written.  In fact, it's so good I wouldn't call it a song, it's an experience, an anthem if you will.  Obviously the length, 18 minutes total, gives it some extra browny points, but that's not what makes it so good (it doesn't hurt, however).  Just the whole song itself is constructed so beautifully, so perfectly, that it just completely, and utterly amazes me.  The lyrics are so politically fueled it's almost surprising: And the weird thing is, unlike some political jargain, this one makes complete sense.  Thing may seem disjointed at times if you follow the lyrics from the book, but when you hear the last line &quot;he's got his, and I've got mine, meet the decline,&quot; everything just clicks in your brain and you'll find yourself saying, &quot;wow, that's amazing!&quot;You may think I'm weird; well, call me what you will, but I just can't give this song high enough praise.

Instead of the veritable Rock symphonies of pretension and musical frippery drawn out over twenty minutes or more, Punk created sub-three minute gobs of snot which meant anyone who could pick up a guitar could get noticed. So what did NOFX go and do? Not afraid of doing the unexpected, NOFX went and created `The Decline', an 18-minute Prog-Punk behemoth.OK, so Prog-Punk is a fairly inaccurate sort of description, but it seems the most appropriate. Basically, it is progressive in that there is a lot of experimentation. There is a lot going on through the song, and close and repeated examinations with headphones help the listener pick up more and more nuances and details. On display is a mix of differing Punk sounds, a number of rhythms, vocal effects, and non-Ska horns feature prominently.The music starts in typical NOFX style, galloping along to Fat Mike's lively bass lines, but then it all suddenly pulls up for a dreamy interlude, before powering back into the same rhythm. The melodic gang backing vocals make an appearance. The sound toughens up somewhat, to a point about a third of the way through the song where a horn makes an appearance with a simple yet catchy little riff, revisited throughout the rest of the song. One of the later breakdowns has an electrified drone mixed with a muted guitar and whispered vocals.`The Decline' was a turning point for a new, more politically aware NOFX. Sure, there had been political songs in the past, like ""Rico"" and ""Murder The Government"", but the tone had been less than serious. If Propagandhi are the Noam Chomsky of North American popular Punk, then NOFX are the Michael Moore. The underlying Left leaning message is similar, but like Moore, NOFX takes the populist route, packed with catchphrases and aiming at easy targets while trying to shake the zombified public out of its addled stupor. That's not to say the message is unworthy or not thought through. Lines like ""There's no answers/When the questions aren't ever asked"" and ""Blame it on human nature, man's destiny/Blame it on the greediocracy"" or any one of a number of other quotes show Fat Mike has been thinking hard and is trying to pitch his ideas in a manner that Generation X might understand.This song apparently took six months to create, and it shows in its complexity and depth. It isn't the sort of song which would have won NOFX any new fans, but sometimes even the converted need to be preached to.",4.0,Punk's not dead,1123286400,"08 6, 2005",Sports_and_Outdoors,1.0

Anyone that dare call them  sell-outs or poseurs are just that themsleves.  To say NOFX and sell-out is  an oxymoron, for the name itself is against selling out.This song is  an 18 minute epic journey about politics, religion,and many other big  issues. The concept of the song is that all the issues discussed during it  is leading America in a downfall (Decline) and how society is so corrupt.  The end of the song even suggest America is in a Fascist state.  NOFX is  disgusted with society today and that is the point of this piece of art.  There are no answers or suggestions merely rhetorical and sarcastic  explanations to the problems of society, and that is what is genious about  the song.  Such is the line &quot;start with the assumption, that a million  people are smart-smarter than one&quot; poking at democracy and how just  because everyone agrees on something does not make it right.  The song  mentions how we destroyed ourselves based on our own creation of this  nation.  It is just an excellent song.I strongly recommend this to  everyone.  This is my favorite song.  I do not consider this an album as  some people complain about the shortness, I just consider it a single.  There is nothing to complain about the shortness of this disc.

It reminds me of a suite written by a classical master, like Stravinsky or Rimsky-Korsakov.  Each part of the song blends into the next, like movements as parts of a greater whole.  The chord progressions and key changes are complex and add a lot to the music, which is something that can't be said about a lot of punk out there.  Each instrument adds to the song, with the trombone riffs being well placed, and the guitar never getting repetitive.  The harmonized voice parts are especially well done.

NoFX is one of the most original, creative, and downright hilarious bands I've ever heard, and this album shows it all. The 18:21(!!) song is full of fast paced snot-punk, as well as a couple of slower parts, and some more melodic parts. The song covers a wide variety of topics on what the world is coming to, and that we, the people. need to do something about it. They sing about how America is dumb, but also how the average American knows this and just ignores it, like in the part where they repeat: ""One more pill to keep me safe/ One more prayer to keep us warm."" They also make a point of saying that with guns, it is too easy to kill someone, thus making the shooter forget that he is actually commiting murder and killing another person. But, all these messages are told very creativley, not making it sounding like social commentary, though that's what it really is, and most listeners probobly won't even pick up these messages the first few times they listen to the cd. The song never gets boring or monotonous, which is amazing.

Such great, and at times,  annoying music! NOFX are the masters of punk. Punk is not Blink182, who  now, are Pop stars. NOFX IS Punk. NOFX's efforts are so brilliant it leaves  me giant goosebumbs just thinking about all their albums, a very vast  collection indeed! Their latest installment of music has a different touch  in comparison of their previous CDs. The fact that they changed a bit was  an outrage at first, but after listening to The Decline about the third  time I fell in love with this CD.  Simply a classic.  The Decline is  composed of one song, lasting about eight-teen minutes. Some may be  disappointed by the abrupt end of the song, but believe me you can listen  to it over and over again. And the best thing is, it'll sound better each  time you press that triangle button. For slow idiots, the play button.  Mike's singing is stuffed with bravery, bearing a narrow view on religion  and politics. Rhythm has upright timing with a respectable choice of words.  Anyone can sing along with it. Hell, even my Dad joins me in doing so.  It has nicely executed guitars, bass, and drums. There are even sound  effects that really enhance the music, although I prefer the rawness of  NOFX. The Decline doesn't seem like one song, because after a few minutes  it'll have a different beat and execution of melodies. Mainly the Pro is  everything, lyrics are tasty as the paste of music, and the main Con is the  shortness.  NOFX's masterpiece is original. Lyrics are finger-pointing  on who's to blame for today's society.  Most lines are very accurate and  down to the point. If I were to be stranded on a remote island with only a  CD player and one billion packs of batteries, The Decline would be on my  top 5 list for which CDs to bring. The elite, underground band is at their  shiniest quality, having many, many years ahead. Hearing the musical  masterpiece as I write this review, it leaves me an overbearing  anticipation for their next album. NOFX Rules!

The smell does get better over time, but for the 1st day or two after use, the snakes aren't the other thing that won't go in the pool as my son and his friends refuse to go in while the smell is at it's strongest.  I think its worth it!",3.0,No wonder they stay away,1210550400,"05 12, 2008",Sports_and_Outdoors,0.0

When you hold it you really understand what design is - beauty, function and form.  The machining is excellent, everything lines up, the materials are good, and the blades sharp.At 2 3/4"" closed, the Peanut is similar to a classic small slip-blade pen knife, only the 2 blades (longer clip and smaller pen) are side-by-side rather than one on each end.  This makes it a little bit thicker, but it's still very much a light, comfortable to carry loose in the pocket every day, knife.  Both blades have 90 degree half-stops.The Peanut is sold with either ""Chrome Vanadium"" (carbon) or ""Tru-Sharp surgical"" (stainless) steel blades.  The CV steel should take and hold a sharper edge (mine was very sharp out of the box and is holding it well), but will loose their luster and develop a light patina over time.  Mine's doing pretty well - you only get minor graying around the tip and thumb-nail mark unless you use it to cut fruit.  Cutting an apple caused some near immediate discoloration.  However the luster came back with a bit of metal polish.  Several months later, I bought my brother-in-law the SS version.  It has a really nice blade with a great edge - sharpest SS pocket knife blade I've seen out of the box.  Given the quality of Case's stainless, I'd lean towards it.The Peanut is sold in a number of handle materials / colors including synthetic, bone, stag, corelon, and mother of pearl.  The handle material you choose affects the price greatly.  Yellow Synthetic is a popular lower cost option that provides good looks, durability and value.  It is solid and quite hard (like Corian, not plastic) and very resistant to dings.  The color is a soft lemon cream that looks really nice against the polished silver / nickel bolsters (to me at least). The brass side rivets are flush and all seams are smooth to the touch.  I really like it and would choose it again.Not much to add.  It's a well made, well written up, elegantly designed classic little knife.  There's a reason Case has such a following.  This is about my 20th pocket knife but my first Case.  It is something special and doesn't have a crazy price tag.

It enables one-handed operation: use your fingers to grip the cup and your thumb to push the spigot, important when you're trying to juggle several things at once. The spigot does not leak or drip.

The size, length, everything really makes it the best inflatable float out there.  I love that I can roll it up and store it inside overnight and not have it take up too much room.  It's a great float, so much better than floats that have the long tubes for air.  My one complaint would be that the brightness of the colors make it a little hard on the eyes when out in the sun.

The ones I found at the store advertise it in green, yellow and pink and the box shows the three colors, green, yellow and pink.  The box I received in the mail was exactly like the one I saw in the store.  I have tried to find this raft in the blue color and I always see the green, yellow, and pink.

I love this raft.Now we have found another use.  With the storms coming we have to leave one car outside b/c we only have a two car garage.  My husband took 2 of these rafts and put them over his car and then covered it with a car cover.  We are hoping that they will soften the blow of a hail storm if we happen to get one.  If the hail destroys the rafts but keeps the cars safe then it is $11.50 well spent.  I just ordered 2 more in case this happens.  He said that the rafts fit perfectly over the car b/c they are so wide.  He said that he really needs 3 instead of 2 so another reason we ordered more.  I hope these stay in stock:)I also have the large Intex lounger that keeps you completely dry so I use that one first and switch to this one when I get too hot.

You won't fall off as with standard ""puny"" floats that aren't very stable. Superior comfort compared to flat foam mattresses.  Especially good for men given the larger dimensions of this float.*Stability.  Lay not just on your back (as with most mattresses) but your stomach, on your side, or straddle it to sit up straight.*Portability.  Rolls up compactly (fully inflated) making it super easy to transport, even strapped to my bike.  None of that inflate/deflate/reflate stuff for me! Inflate once, roll it up and rock on.*Keep Cool.  Unlike ""fat"" air mattresses that sit on top of/out of the water, this mattress is partially submerged and keeps you cool.*Affordable.  'Nuf said.*Vibrant 80's Colors.  Turquoise, pink, green, yellow. All day glow neon.  You never know what color you're going to get, but they are all nice.*Deceptively Simple.  The best designs are.*Versatility.  Doubles great as a camping mattress. I've spent major bucks in the past on fancy camping pads and I have to say they don't hold a candle to the comfort of this $10 air mattress due to its length and width.  Great support with the wavy air chambers give comparable support as eggshell/memory foam mattress toppers on a conventional mattress. Sleep on it at night in your tent, then throw it in the lake during the day to work on your tan. Excellent as a butt pad during outdoor concerts or movies. Put it under a black light with a mirror ball and instant disco! Also great for impromptu guests crashing on your living room floor. I use it just as much for these activities as in the pool.Cons:*Durability.  As previous reviews mention, ""duds"" are a reality due to the ""made in China"" consequence.  Sometimes the seams split easily; sometimes the seams are sealed wrong so you have difficulty inflating it.  I've had a single one last 3 years, and I've also gone through 3 in a single summer season due to manufacturing defects. Granted, I'm a heavy user for multiple purposes, but I do wish the quality of the product was improved to be more reliable (hint hint: bring manufacturing back to America!)  Replacement frequency is high; I go through about three every year.*Getting your friends to give it back once they have discovered its awesomeness.All things considered though, the pros outweigh the durability issue.

Well reviewed item, almost hate to share this secret wonder in case they raise the price, it sells out, I can't get another one, or they sell out to a manufacturer that makes it different.

I make them get off of it, because it's mine and I don't want to use any other float. This float makes me mean and selfish.Due the wave design it isn't like the annoying tubular designs, it almost acts like a floating blanket! It moves with my body better, it's easier to get up into when you're already in the water with it, and it's good and big sized. Since it's a bit thinner than the regular tubular design floats it will let you be wetter, allows you to be sort of more submerged in spots if you want, or if you lay still and centered it keeps you out of the water (depending how much you weigh I suppose). Also, I throw a towel over it and nap like a baby on the beach.The original one I bought has gotten a couple leaks, near the seam which I would think is the product's fault.

My dad and made up a sort of ""dareball"", where we'd both go into the ocean and throw the ball to the other at a slight angle, so that he'd have to reach or even slightly move closer to the incoming waves.  And for a bit of extra devious fun, we'd often time it so that the catch would be required just a second or two before a wave was to come crashing down :DPenalty for missing?  The ball would get carried to shore, so it was kinda like Chutes and Ladders where the losing party would have to swim + trudge back to shore (or wait for a kindly stranger to throw the ball back out :D)So what makes Tracball so much fun?  Well, the rackets are pretty durable, the balls float, and the game supports beginners as well as more advanced players (who can come up with umpteen ways to have the balls curve to the side and even do last-minute dips).  My dad and I also had fun trying to catch and throw with our non-dominant hands, or throw the ball while facing away from each other, and so on.  Endless varieties, and in the end, lots of laughs and a ton of burned calories.Downsides?  Beware of ball-eating trees, since you can throw the balls pretty high.  Oh, and -- while I thankfully never experienced this -- watch out for excited retriever dogs who could likely crunch the hollow plastic balls into oblivion.

Although the music of Johann Sebastian Bach hardly needs any aid in attesting to its own greatness, surely the composer must feel a tinge of pride every time the Windsb&auml;chers give one of his choral masterpieces in their trademark brilliant, immaculate style.Here, Beringer gives us Bach's joyous Magnificat in D and three of the Six Motets.The Magnificat is presented in a festive, rousing performance that fully captures the unmitigated joy of the piece while spotlighting the choir's incredibly clean, forceful technique. In the opening chorus, following the flowing orchestral prelude, the choir nearly explodes on listeners, crying over and over, ""Magnificat, magnificat, anima mea Dominum."" Beringer takes the tempo moderately, eschewing the heavy-handed solemnity of Karl Richter but also avoiding the quasi-comical, strangled sibilances of Paul McCreesh's breakneck speeds in his own take on the Magnificat.Soloists are good--competent and involved in the music. The real stars of this disc (and any Windsb&auml;cher recording), however, are the boys themselves. You simply must HEAR the Windsb&auml;chers to fully appreciate how amazing their technique is, especially for a choir of younger children. TheirMass in B Minoris a triumphant example of their particular brand of audible perfection.In the Magnificat, the choir covers an impressive amount of emotional ground, from the restless tread of the ""Omnes generationes"" through the inexpressibly haunting beauty of the ""Suscepit Israel,"" which sounds as though it's fresh off the next release from the U.K. group Libera. The concluding Doxology is a majestic peroration on the glory of the Trinity, showcasing the choir's magnificent ability to really pull out all the stops, dynamically, while still retaining their immaculately clean intonation and technique.But the Magnificat is only half of the disc. For the remainder, the Windsb&auml;chers give three of Bach's Six Motets: ""Komm, Jesu, Komm,"" ""Singet dem Herrn ein neues Lied,"" and the well-known ""Jesu, Meine Freude.""The doppelchor (""double choir"") arrangement for ""Komm, Jesu, Komm"" is presented with moving clarity, as the choir's two halves call to each other repeatedly, ""Come, Jesus!"" / ""Come, Jesus!"" The sunlight of the chorus ""Singet dem Herrn ein neues Lied"" is given an exciting performance here, but ""Jesu Meine Freude"" is in a class by itself--there is perhaps only one recording with a knabenchor better than this one: the Windsb&auml;chers' disc of the Motets, complete.The Motets are accompanied by the Prager Kammerorchester, which will be a problem for some who prefer to hear the pieces a cappella. Those who do have this preference needn't worry, however: the Windsb&auml;chers also offer (but not available on Amazon, unfortunately) a disc of all six motets unaccompanied--despite the beautiful performances here, I personally prefer the unaccompanied complete disc to the three offered here.Nonetheless, the Windsb&auml;chers offer yet another stunningly beautiful set of Bach performances for our enjoyment. If anything captures the true spirit of Bach's intentions in his music--to glorify God and refresh the spirit--it is certainly this disc...and all of the Windsb&auml;chers' Bach recordings in general.

Because the ball gets a good spin on it from the paddle you can throw it in a slightly different direction than you really want it to go and it will curve gracefully through the air.  Please do note that the ball is hard and fairly weighty and can really hurt you or your child.My best throw ever occurred when my brother and I agreed to stand still and see if we could hit the other person.  Keep in mind we are like 100ft apart so that this was not an easy task.  On my very first throw the ball left the cradle fast and furious with a slight downward slant that then gracefully curved upwards toward his face.  The ball would have literally hit him straight in the face if he hadn't cheated at the last second by ducking.

I used to carry around a set of four (i.e., two sets) with the hard and polystyrene (styrofoam) balls in the trunk of my (then new) '78 Trans Am. Wow, am I dating myself there! We'd crank up the tunes (and ""refreshments"", LOL!) and work up a good sweat chasing that ball around! Everyone loved the game, and we were already obnoxious late-teens/early 20-somethings!Fast-forward to today: I bought two sets for my nephews (ages 6 and 8) and ended-up buying two sets for myself! For no money, this is a great toy that provides sun and fresh air, develops strength and coordination, and provides badly needed exercise instead of forming life-long couch-potato's like today's video games!The quality hasn't suffered too badly in all these years: The racquets are now multi-colored charcoal/turquoise instead of flat black, the wrist straps are missing (resulting in lots of unintentionally thrown racquets a la Wii), and the styrofoam balls are no longer included. You do get the std. yellow ball, and a glow-in-the-dark version instead, which is pretty-cool but not entirely useful after dark....they need to sit in the sun all day, and don't glow very long after dark.Personally, while I miss the wrist straps, I don't miss the foam balls. While you could throw some crazy curve-ball tricks shots, any wind whatsoever killed the fun. It was more suited to a gymnasium, than outdoors. You can get plenty of arcing, curve-ball action with just a little practice from the hard plastic balls.Along with Whammo!'s greatest product ever (i.e., the Frisbee), this is a must for the trunk for impromptu beach, park, school-yard or back-yard fun for little and big kids alike!Highly Recommended!",5.0,Another Whammo!

At that time the rackets were all black and the balls were orange. If you are buying because you had as a child, like I did, you'll note once you receive the set that they are very similar, the colors are a little different though. I still have my old set, but wanted to add more rackets for more people. The balls on the newer set are definitely a little thicker and a little heavier. I found it does change the way the ball flies slightly but not necessarily in a bad way, just different. The old ball being lighter spins more and curves a little better, while the new ball is better for straight shot throwing but you can still curve it pretty good with practice.In the box:Rackets (2 plastic rackets like lacrosse nets only hard with an interior track that helps whip the ball from the racket and direct it into the cup of the racket when catching the ball)Balls (2 Plastic hollow balls, fairly light)Here are the general Pros/Cons/Tips.Pros-Great Lacrosse Catch Type game, very fun-Gets the kids and the adults moving around in the yard for exercise that doesn't involve the Wii, thats still enjoyable.-Challenging to play and you can create different variations of catch games-Create some wicked curves with the balls in every direction, I think I shattered the space-time curve continuum once.-All ages (almost) can enjoy it.-Something that you can start off with slow and gradually learn the different moves if you have younger players.-Inexpensive game that provides hours of outdoor entertainment.-Easily expandable, buy more rackets.Cons-Really there are none but keep in mind the following:-If you are uncoordinated or playing with younger players you might want to take it easy at first, because the ball can be curved in extreme manners and with some velocity if you want. Therefore if you get hit in the face its going to hurt.-If you are playing near or on concrete beware: once it hits concrete especially after a missed catch, the ball is going to be rolling for a while, if you live on a hill, well you get the idea. Watch for cars!Game TypesEssentially the game centers around throwing the ball back and forth with the rackets. You can have a simple catch, you can play hockey and try to get into the opposing players goal(whatever you want to use), create your own variance. I suppose you could also make a tag game out of it and try to nail the other players, could be fun, do it at your own risk. Our favorite game is trying to throw the ball so the other person can't catch it. This is a point based game, where you earn a point each time the person trys and fails to catch because they missed it or it hit their racket, etc.. You can play up to 10 points with best out of 5 games or whatever. You have to set the framework in the beginning of the game though as what constitutes a missed catch, basically it has to be catchable and a honest attempt has to be made because if it hits the racket or it was a clear whiff then the other player gets a point. The honor system applies.Playing TipsFirst off be creative when throwing the ball. Using a quick whipping motion with your hand you can drag the racket across your body or downwards to create curves towards your opponent or victim(ha ha)in almost any direction. You can spin and whip your wrist at the same time putting curve and spin on the ball like English in pool. Not only does this cause some extreme curving, but the spin can make it difficult to catch by your opponent if they don't have the ball locked onto, it also makes it more likely to land in their racket and jump back out again. You can throw super high floaters straight up in the air towards your opponent as well, this can be very difficult to catch especially on a windier day, the ball moves while coming down.Try playing at different wind level days, it can make a huge difference on how the game is played, but switch sides to be fair. You can throw direct speed shots straight-aways. Remember if you throw hard and straight without curving the ball is going to go very fast at the person and usually where you aimed, they should be coordinated enough to catch the ball or some pain could ensue.  You are going to catch the ball either over or under handed (pretend the open face of the racket is your palm side) depending on what angle the ball is coming from. Underhanded is more difficult because the ball has a better chance of spinning out of the racket if your not careful, you have to let it hit the cup of the racket and move your hand up quickly to secure the ball in the cup. When the ball comes in from above if you time it correctly it should stay put but its best to cock your hand back a little once the ball is in the cup to avoid it from bouncing out. When catching it helps if you square your body with whatever direction (angle)the ball is coming from. The most challenging part of the game is when you have two skilled players throwing lots of curves because on the receiving end it can be difficult to anticipate the balls movement. Truly the ball can have some weird movements. A straight curve isn't too bad, but if there is even a little wind and all of sudden the wind drops off or picks up, then you have a fast curve coming where the ball can drop or rise 5 feet in height in a second right before it gets to you. This is where the true fun comes in, watching your opponent trying to catch a crazy throw or watching them be out of position or juggling the ball as its bouncing in their racket before an awesome reel in or as the ball ignominiously hits the ground.Overall you and your family will love this game.",5.0,Great Game for Everyone!,1261008000,"12 17, 2009",Sports_and_Outdoors,1.0

Ever since i purchased it, my friends and I have been having the best time. Whether you are playing with your little neighbor kid, your sister, or your dad, or whoever it is, it never fails to bring a smile to people's faces. My all time favorite way to play it is in the water. Although you may have a tougher time trying to receive the ball, it is so entertaining to attempt to dive and catch the ball, or to watch friends do the same. Another reason I like playing in the lake is because it simply skips off the water. So even if you make a toss that is almost straight down, the ball still has a chance to get to the one waiting for it. The design of the ball is so creative because it allows you to throw it with such wicked curve that sometimes the thrower doesn't even know where it is going. If anyone were debating on getting this game or not, I would say definitely get it! It is certainly worth the few bucks, it brings people closer together, it is simple enough for anyone to play, and it is always incredibly fun.

This causes some friction between the board and the wheel that is noticeable and actually makes a grinding noise. With limited success I have waxed the areas that are creating the friction.

I'm hoping it will improve my balance and also prepare me for learning how to snowboard (I've read elsewhere that it is supposed to be good training and strengthening) So far I absolutely love it. It is a GREAT workout, and it doesnt seem to get boring...even though its basically a piece of wood on top of a cylinder lolI did have a few problems... When I first ordered the board, the one that came was defective. The screw in the cylinder part was stripped, and when I was on the board, it kind of um... fell apart. BUT, it really wasn't a problem because when I called the customer service number that came with the package, they sent me a brand new board and cylinder completely FREE. And the new one is built sturdy and is fine. Another problem is that the board I'm using is starting to appear somewhat warped...it doesn't lay flat on the floor anymore... this really isn't a problem as far as performance, but I'm wondering how long the board is going to last.A few recommendations:1. DO NOT use the balance board on any rough surfaces, it will ruin the wood of the cylinder.2. The board is best on a smooth surface...wood, vinyl, tile, cement, or a very thin flat rug. It moves too slow on carpet.3. Be prepared that the first time you use the board you might feel a bit dizzy lol I did at least... but it goes away the more you use it and the more comfortable you get4. Start off holding on to something lol otherwise you may go flying... But again as you get more comfortable it becomes A LOT of fun... Some people can even do tricks with it... No clue how lol but that's what Ive heard...So overall I would definitely recommend this product for anyone who is looking for strengthening/training in balance, a good workout, or just some fun.

With the bonus of having a variety of different games to play when/if you tire of the aforementioned 2.The board is of fairly heavy ply with veneer or some sort of laminate to give the surface a nice flat, warp free surface(on both sides).  I did however, (lightly)rub in some standard furniture polish to reduce the friction of the Carrom men(pieces). And this worked fantastically. The board is surrounded by a raised impact plastic covering. That both serves as a rebound edge and to protect the board when stored or in tranasit.The nettings for the pockets is descent and should withstand years of regular use.The Carrom men(pieces) are of high quality plastic. And have a good heft to them considering what they are. They rebound and deflect off the other pieces pretty convincingly.Also included are: Cue sticks(wooden dowels with a plastic tip), pins(for some of the games - ie. Bowling stile or skittles), lightweight plastic tops used for games like Skittles. Paper inserts(#1-15) that are cut and placed within the hollow centers of the Carrom pieces for a few of the Carrom game variations provided in the game manual.  The manual itself is a compact, single fold/stapled affair.  The rules are clear for most games. And a little short of description, so you may find, if unfamiliar with a few of the games, that a couple of read throughs may be necessary.If this is your first set, or are thinking of buying a set for the ""Rest"" of the family or ""kids"" then this is a great, low-cost way to do it.",4.0,Good Quality board & pieces,1189728000,"09 14, 2007",Sports_and_Outdoors,1.0

The board does not include a box for either the board or the pieces.  I realize the board itself is big and a box might not be necessary, but until I put all the pieces in a big zip-lock bag, I was constantly losing rings and pegs.  And even still, the two sticks don't fit into my bag.Second, the included direction book has an extraordinary number of games and variations, which is awesome, but some of them are so vague and short or incomplete, they aren't as helpful or clear as you would like when you are learning new games.

Instead of a large rectangular table with 6 pockets, Carrom is played on a square, wooden table with four pockets.  My kids and I play this board game on top of a folding card table.  As I did as a kid 30+ yrs. ago, I used a lazy susan so that players can just sit on a chair or stool.  We'd just spin the table towards us instead of walking around before taking a shot.  Lazy Susans are available at Target or Walmart.  I bought mine as a 2-piece set from Costco for $14.The biggest benenit for younger kids who are playing sports is that Carrom teaches geometry.  Like billiards, striking the white cue on the right, left, or the middle will determine the direction where the carrom you're trying to sink will go.  This game demonstrates banking off of 1,2, 3 or even 4 walls.  How hard or soft you hit with your cue stick can relate to ball control on the sports field or court.What I'm most happy about, is that Carroms has reduced the number of hours the kids are spending on electronic video games.  Instead of using mindless, repetitive movements on their joy stick or controller, my kids are finally using their brain to play a game thats been around since the late 1800's.

Not true with Spaulding... James Spaulding is neither stuck in the past nor a slave of the dictates of the future.  All in all he is a deep and soulful hard bop master, who has a lot to say everytime he picks up that alto or flute of his.  - - When Spaulding plays, you listen, and you never exactly know what you're in for... He can be profound, earthy and melodic at times, or wildly outside, experimental yet visciously swinging and often all of this in the course of a breath, yet he always lands on the right note !Escapades shows the master in Rudy Van Gelder's studio with Kenny Washington, Don Sicker, John Hicks and Ray Drummond  tackling a great choice of tunes, including three Mobley pieces and some Grant Green.  - - Like many of the classic Hard Bop sessions of the '60s, not only does the star shine, but the ensemble works great together.  Don Sickler in particular, proves himself not only to be a great soloist, but a wonderful accompaniest who's lines brilliantly compliment Spaulding's rich melodies, especially in the opening track &quot;Escapade&quot;.There is one other great thing about this CD I should mention - - its clear to anyone who's heard his other recent albums that he's on a roll, and clearly ESCAPADE is proof that he's not letting up.  - - Last month, for example, I had James on my &quot;Remembering Eddie Jefferson&quot; session, and there were a few tricky tunes which we wound up doing a retake or two on... each time it lead to a major crisis as everyone (from the people in the mixing room to the musicians) didn't want to lose his solo... but the next time we'd cut, he'd even lay something heavier.  - - This is one cat who has the music in him, and ESCAPADE has afforded him an ingenuine vehicle for getting it out !",5.0,The Master On a Roll ! ! !,985219200,"03 22, 2001",Sports_and_Outdoors,1.0

The other goal was a kiddie 3' x 2' goal with 2 ski poles set into the ground (just so you know there are affordable 6' goal alternatives).This is a GREAT goal for shooting practice, you get a solid rebound when you hit the goal, and it's banked so it rebounds MUCH BETTER than a 90-degree vertical goal.  You can turn it around and use it like a regular goal, too!  It's very sturdy with 1.5"" steel tubes, however, one of the spring-loaded pins broke off with a sharp point showing (not a problem as I haven't taken the goal apart).After 1 year there is hardly any rust (it's been a rainy year here in southern CA with 30 days of rain).  It just BARELY fits into my SUV if I collapse the back (i.e. so the rebound almost faces up) so it's almost flat (no space for rear passengers).  That makes it pretty easy to transport 4 blocks to the park, and saves me time.  The only way to improve it would be to make it foldable.

I've coached 13 seasons of youth rec soccer between my children, indoor and outdoor, and have seen the full spectrum of skills and abilities on our teams.  I've recommended this training device to several kids on my teams who need extra  touches to improve their passing/trapping/shooting, and general foot coordination, I think they stand to benefit the most, but advanced players can benefit as well.So far, we've only used this a handful of times, and it's difficult for my youngest daughter to get the ball up in the air, so the ball plunks off the base crossbar bar and doesn't really rebound back.  This rebounder will encourage her to kick with better form.This will help my 9yr/old son improve his shooting and passing as well, but he has already begun using it to practice goalkeeping.  He kicks hard from about 20 feet out at slight angles, and then has to move quickly to cover the rebound.  The ball comes off of the rebounder at surprisingly strong and fast pace.The rebounder does tend to tip over for harder shots, and shots that hit the frame, especially when the rebounder is in a more reclined position.  I see the need for using the included stakes, but I haven't tried them yet.Another reviewer felt that this rebounder isn't durable enough for serious soccer, and they may be right; I don't plan to take this out to team practices, but you can tear up just about any equipment if not treated properly.  It handles hard shots from me just fine, even the ones that plunk off the bars.  I just don't see this being an issue unless you're shooting from close distance with maximum velocity.  That's not what this device is intended for.  Use a real goal for that type of shooting.  At this pricepoint, I only expect this rebounder to last a couple years max, any more is gravy.Assembly took longer than I expected, and the instructions were somewhat difficult to read, especially when connecting the top frame to the base, but it's manageable.I'll probably try this out in the driveway for practicing basketball as well.If you have questions, post a comment, I usually respond within a day.",5.0,Great training device,1332115200,"03 19, 2012",Sports_and_Outdoors,1.0

She loves that she can kick around when I'm busy, and we've used it together taking turns and even passing off of it at angles.Pros:* Put it together by myself in about 25 minutes, and only needed a little help stretching the net on.  Directions were easy to follow and it is well designed and easy to assemble.One note on assembly - you'll only get 4 bolts with wingnuts and washers, but you'll swear you need 6 screws.  That's because the front base screws are already screwed in so you'll just need to unscrew them, line up the pieces, and screw them back in. I panicked for a moment until I looked at the ends of the base pipes.Another assembly note - don't just start putting it together in part-number order.  The parts are numbered, but follow the direction. Really, it's easier that way.* Durable parts - nothing feels flimsy at all, especially the net once it's stretched on.  You might scratch the white enamel on the pipes if you drag it across a driveway, but other than that, it doesn't feel like it'll bend or warp at all.* Great rebound - the ball really pops off the net.  You do need to get the ball up off the ground for it to rebound properly, but that wasn't a problem for my 9-yr old daughter.  The rebound snaps off the net, requiring the kicker to really be prepared and on the balls of her feet to get the rebound.  No kicking and standing and watching with this!  Oh, and you don't have to hit the sweetspot to get a good rebound, it just needs to be off the ground.  My daughter loves aiming for the center though.*Light weight - it's easy enough for my daughter to carry/drag in and out of the garage by herself (just make sure your car is out of the way).Not Really Cons - Not sure these are really cons, but things to consider* There's really no undoing of this goal once it's together. I don't plan on taking this to practice, but if I wanted to take it to the park, it would take some effort.  It *MIGHT* fit into the back of my crossover, I haven't tried yet.* You'll want to use the U-hooks to hold the goal in place.  This isn't an issue, but I've read some reviews that said it fell over easy with good strikes.  It will, so just use the hooks.  Using the hooks, I haven't had any trouble with the goal tipping over.  And you'll definitely need them if you angle it beyond the 90 degrees, but again, this isn't an issue, just push/pound them in.OVERALL - I asked my daughter to add to my review, here's what she said:""I LOVE my new goal. I love that I can play by myself in the yard, and I love that I can get it out of the garage myself (though I prefer my dad to set it up for me).  It's great that the ball comes back to me and I don't have to chase it unless I miss the rebound. It really keeps me on my toes!""So there you have it, straight from the kid's mouth.  I couldn't be happier with its durability, the size and quality, and I love that it's got my kid out practicing without me.",5.0,Couldn't be happier,1375488000,"08 3, 2013",Sports_and_Outdoors,1.0
