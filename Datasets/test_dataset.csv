Neither the sticky sugar nor the egg nor the denser versions of milk (condensed/heavy cream) attaches strongly.  After allowing the mixer's gel to return to room temperature, light soap and water is all that is needed.My only complaint is that after 30 minutes the appliance achieves only a ""soft-serve"" consistency rather than a firm dessert.  But that is no big deal, since one merely has to transfer the soft-serve to a container destined for the freezer.",4.0,Easy Clean,1185840000,"07 31, 2007",Home_and_Kitchen,1.0,,

My three oldest are now in college, but my youngest still use SOS for PC.  I only wish they had a MAC version.  Years ago, I used the workbooks.  I was thrilled when they came up with the computer version.  Every year, it gets better.  Again, they just need to make a version for the MAC.  Reviewer #2 may not realize you can set the program for easy spelling, then it will only deduct points on a mispelled problem and not count it as completely wrong.  YOU set up how harshly it grades your students.  Go into the teacher mode and where you set the grade percentages, check EASY SPELLING.As for their customer service, they used to be in Chandler, Arizona and they were wonderful.  The techs stayed on the phone with me for hours when I had computer issues when the programs first came out.  They were wonderful.  I haven't had any issues in more than a year, but I have had to talk to them a couple of times after they moved to Iowa.  Again, they were great.  Offered me free shipping and everything.  Sweet girls.I also LOVE the curriculum itself.  Vocabulary words for each lesson, spelling words, review mode, games, and just all of it.  I rearrange it a bit by placing the spelling lessons FIRST, then the regular lessons, quiz, spelling quiz, and begin again with the next spelling lesson.  Otherwise I don't think it gives the students enough time to learn the spelling words each week.  But, I have the option of moving the lessons around how I see fit.  Awesome!I would recommend Switched on Schoolhouse to ANY homeschooler.  I've been doing this a LONG time and Alpha Omega has been with me all the way.  I was a math major in college and I love the math more than Saxon (I know there are Saxon die hards out there, but move out of the last century already).  Science is packed with experiments, videos to watch if you CAN'T do them yourself, lists of things to purchase so you can; History covers the basics, all you need; Language has it all; there's even a Bible that isn't too over the top and can be used by the majority of Christian religions.All in all, I give AOP and A+ and their program a high score as well.  Only being Mac friendly could make it better.",5.0,A fan of AOP,1283904000,"09 8, 2010",Toys_and_Games,1.0,,

I even went to the store and tested the nook, played with it. I went to other stores that had other e readers and looked at them as well. Then one of my coworkers showed me her Kindle and I was able to play with it and look at it.Then the i pad came out, So I went to the store and looked at the i pad and played with it as well. I have read review after review and watched you-tube...Well The holidays came and my husband bought me the Nook!!! I was so excited! I wanted the Nook as soon as I saw it, but took my time and compared it to other e readers.. I knew right from the start which e reader I wanted after being in discussion with others about e readers and after looking and playing with a few of them.Right out of the box the Nook, made me happy and gave me confirmation of my long desire to own the Nook. My husband knew that I wanted it, but I waited trying to justify why I needed an e reader and to see if anyone of them would go beyond my expectations. The Nook did exactly that! For me the Nook was worth the money and time it took to decide on which one to purchase... Here is why I love the Nook, I can lend books to other, I can download from my library which is so awesome! I can surf the net for FREE!!!!!! no monthly fees like the i pad, It fits in my computer bag, purse, which makes it so easy to take with me, It has my favorite games, Chess and Sukodu! It was easy for me to download a ebook that I already have, but have been unable to read due to me not wanting to tote my lap top around, the book loaded right from my lap top to the Nook in no time... The amount of free books that are available to the Nook, and the daily free treats from Barnes And Nobles! Which will more than pay for the Nook over time. Being able to call Barnes and Nobles and talk to a live person over the phone and being able to walk in the store and get face to face customer service.I also like the fact that when you are in the store you can read ebooks for free for an hour and download more free ebooks! For me It was the right choice for our family, as when we go to Barnes and Nobles with our children we can stay longer now that we have the nook and can receive free treats and more free ebooks! It pays for itself... These are some of the reason why I love my nook and I am excited that I received the Nook for a gift! I can not say enough about the Nook, I don't have to be tied to one book store like Itunes, Ibook, are the Kindle store... I don't like limits and the Nook allows me to be free to choose where to get my books from...Now with that said, When I visited my local Barnes and Nobles and received a free smoothie, It was so stress free and everyone was so nice.. I could not believe it!I have also downloaded music that I can listen to and have my ear plugs for that, I have also downloaded several books which was so easy to download that I was shocked! I like getting my monies worth, and not having to pay extra monthly fees.Now with that said, I hope that when you do your research you will consider the Nook, I am surprised that there are not more reviews than the current number of reviews.

My husband thought it might be because the Pantone pages show about 20 different variations on the color (cherry red, tomato red, burgundy red, wine red) etc. and he thought it might be better to just have ONE color to represent the concept (just cherry red for red) and that that might be the issue.  These cards looked well made and since my girls had destroyed a ""heavy cardstock"" style of flash cards before, they were the best option.  The ring is plastic, and one set (this one) the ring stays together better than the other set (the ABCs one).  A drop of super glue should fix that.  The cards are very heavy cardboard, and have a glossy sheen on them, which makes them easy to clean up (wipe off food...) and also easy for the girls to turn the cards (2.5 and 4 yr old).  The quality is high in my opinion.  the words are easy to read, and the shapes are easy to distinguish for the most part.  The bunny with the square tooth was odd in my opinion - I get it, but the square was very small.  It does help them identify the shapes in real world settings, but I was looking for something more basic than that.  My only complaint on the set is that for the colors the front side has it on the animal (for example, the blue elephant, since that's the pic you see on this page), but it is set in the solid color background (purple).  When you turn the card over, it shows you the color ""blue"" in a circle, but the background of that page isn't blue, it is purple.  So when you ask a 2.5 yr old what color that is, half the time she says purple, half the time blue.  I'd have preferred the whole back side of the card be the identifying color ""blue"".  The ironic part is that the shape cards are this way - the back is the same color inside the shape as outside it, so I may end up using those to identify colors as well as shapes, since there won't be any confusion as to which part I'm asking her to identify.  All in all, I'd buy them again, but they certainly weren't exactly what I was looking for in terms of a more straightforward approach than the pantone books.

I have made both ice cream and sorbet and both turned out great.  Due to other reviewers remarks I chilled the mixture in the mixing bowl for about 30 minutes in the freezer before adding to the machine.

One thing I've hated since I don't have a 'gym' is having to lug 20 different dumbbells in and out of the closet every other day! The reason I bought these was because you can double up multiple bands to the handles to combine more weight. Meaning once I am curling 40 pounds I dont need to go spend another $40 on dumbbells, but can combine two bands and get the 40 pounds. If you don't want to have to switch the bands between exercises then get the ones with separate handles, but then you can't double up. These are good quality and I've had no trouble with them.

My two kids (13 & 15) and  I have not been able to stop playing since we got this.  The game requires no &#34;Dungeon Master&#34; and it pits you and your friends against the dungeon beasts.  Several scenarios can be chosen to launch the game, and these varying in difficulty and duration.  We found that the first two scenarios were more about learning the flow of the game, but things really got fun in the third scenario (first one that used the chamber tiles).The game comes with predetermined heroes, from which each player chooses.  Each has unique abilities, with cards to remind you of the damage, healing or characteristic of abilities.  The dungeon is created from tiles that are randomly selected as the game progresses.  Each dungeon tile explored has either a random monster, random encounter, or both.  Monsters are &#34;handled&#34; by the player that drew them, but they come with an attack strategy.  While the monster cards are not that great to look at, they do give a fairly detailed attack strategy that allows the player to determine which hero the monster attacks or other actions a monster may do (ex. Kobolds love to go looking for help from their friends).  The monster and hero figures are high quality, but are unpainted.  If you desire to paint the figures, do some web searching and you will quickly find a vast community of gamers willing to help you.  My kids and I were ecstatic to find that our monsters from the Dungeon Command series were compatible with WoA.  Mixing our monster cards from Dungeon Command into the monster deck from WoA makes things even more challenging.  There's nothing more intimidating than revealing you chamber monsters and realizing you have to face an Ogre and a Dracolich, along with the baddies already in play.I do have a few minor complaints.  The box is IMPRESSIVE and high quality.  The choice of heroes is a bit strange, and I wish they'd included male and female version of both.  The instructions manuals are printed on thin paper, and given the extremely high quality of the other components, they definitely should have made the manuals more durable.  The artwork on the monster cards is boring compared to those from the Dungeon Command series.  I wish they would have made the treasures that Increase Armor Class or Attack &#34;stackable&#34;, so that they were easier to keep track of (as in Dungeon Command).  I may mark my cards along the bottom edge to serve this purpose.Overall, this is a GREAT game, and well worth the purchase price.  It has given us hours of enjoyment and quality time together, untethered from our electronic devices.  The game lends itself to customization of monster sets allowing the utilization of monsters from other D&D; sets (i.e., Dungeon Command).  Although there is no true character design, as the heroes are a predetermined group, with some imagination, there is no reason that you could not design your own hero cards.Buy this game!",5.0,Why haven't you bought this already?!,1390694400,"01 26, 2014",Toys_and_Games,1.0,,

I haven't been trying to produce ice cream on the spot for guests and in the future I'll know not to attempt it.  More concerning has been that the motor shuts off when it overheats (at least it is smart enough to shut off).

Salvatore was releasing the first Drizzt books at around the same time, so I picked the series up and have read every one of the novels.  For the most part they're great and I would highly recommend them.  This game has a lot of recognizable names, which is nice for everyone like myself who has read the books.  However, I did not find the game to be much fun at all.  Here's why:1) There is no role-playing.  The game is purely hack-and-slash, which is not what I look for in D&D.;  It could have been ok, however...2) The rules are over-restrictive (and simplified from full-on D&D;) and get in the way of enjoyment.  This game still has tons of rules, but they're taking components of D&D; (which is far more complex) and smashing them into a single-purpose board game.  This means that you still have to spend a lot of time learning fairly inconsequential rules that are essential to the functioning of the game.3) There is only a single, workable strategy if you want to win: run...fast.  Because of the way the game is designed, your characters are punished for not moving at an extremely rapid pace toward the objective.  It makes the game difficult to enjoy because I spend all my time strategizing how to avoid drawing Encounter cards (which you'll become familiar with if you play the game).  The rest of the decisions you need to make in the game are extremely straightforward and simple.  Some characters only have one reusable attack option.Some of my friends who had never played a real RPG before had a good time with this game.  We later played a real D&D; session, which they liked more.  In my opinion, this is a 2.5 star game (I bumped it to 3 because I'm a Drizzt fan and less RPG-experienced people liked it more).  I don't care to play it again, but that's because I know there's much better stuff out there.  The game appealed more to people used to playing board games rather than RPGs.

One in each color to correspond to the standard Tree House set of stacking plastic pyramids (these are not included but are required).  Each board has nine spaces in a 3X3 grid.  Each space has on and off arrows to show possible directions of movement.  At the start of the game, pieces are stacked so that there three different colors and none of them match the board they are on.  The players then try to get their three pieces into the center space of the same-colored board.Movement is determined by two dice.  The first tells you how many movement points you have.  The second allows for rearrangement of the boards or extra moves.  The larger the piece, the more movement points it takes to move one square.  Only pieces at the top of a stack can be moved unless movement points are used to bring the piece to the top of the stack.  Simple rules but not just a simple game.

When I ordered and received this pair of binoculars instead (Melissa and Doug is always a reliable bet, right?), I was really surprised at how small it was.  Its okay, since they are for small kids with small faces, but its not really a &#34;substantial&#34; item.  I guess the compactness and lightness can be considered a &#34;pro&#34; since it doesn't take up much space and it actually folds down even further.I do think the neck strap is a danger however.  I understand that part of the fun of having a pair of binoculars is wearing them around your neck -- but kids know that too and thats the first thing they do is to put the string over their neck.  My issue is that it really is more of a flimsy string, and not a real thick safe strap.  Its the kind of cheap string that twists up around your neck as soon as you put the binoculars on and start to move around.  Total strangling hazard in my eyes, and this is for an item that is recommended for as young as 36 months.The string is also cheaply done, and is threaded from back to front, rather than left to right, which means that the binoculars don't really lay flat on your chest, but rather twists to one side, even further promoting the twisting and the choking of the neck.I'm going to be removing this &#34;strap&#34; with a pair of scissors.

Firstly remember nothing is perfect and not all people are going to be pleased! It doesn't get a five rating because as mentioned by other reviewers the battery life does not really equate to the required portability of some users. However I do get a lot of use from it, in the car it plugs into the line in, it gets used on the plane when travelling and when visiting London it is connected with the line out to the system there, giving me access to most of my music collection. Its use is simple and the structure of the access to the files is great giving multiple methods of accessing the type of music you want and the tracks easily moved to the playlist. As for the problems experienced in ripping and loading from the PC. Personally I use MusicMatch Juke box to rip, organize and play music on my PC so the files are already ripped and categorized etc by the CDDB system. This makes it very easy to transfer music to the Jukebox as the Playcenter software which comes with it enables you to locate the folders/files on your PC and just load them across to your Jukebox, this I have found to be very quick, and on the occassion that I did find one corrupt file is was to do with the original ripping and not the transfer. It is a great means to move and listen to a lot of music, its not a put in your pocket whist you jog player. The only thing that it was missing in my opion was its inability to act as a stand alone player, which has now been addressed by the Cambridge Labs Playdock, which I have just ordered!

The battery life is misrepresented by B&N.; The only way you could possibly get 10 days out of the battery is if it is off. However, 2 to 4 days is a real possibility, So, bring your charger or USB to computer cable. Just like Apple IPOD, the B&N; folks decided to use a non-standard USB cable that appears to match the Apple ones. This is a minor problem, but do not expect to borrow a USB cable from someone while on travel. The included small charger worked very well.The key thing is how does the NOOK function as a book reader. In my opinion, it is adequate, and no more. I downloaded a number of free books without any problem. I also downloaded some paid books form B&N.; Once again, no problem. Finally, I downloaded some books from my public library onto my computer (not the NOOK)using the free Adobe software. Using the USB cable to my NOOK, I simply dragged the books to the NOOK, and voila, two seocnds later they were available for 14 days. So far so good. One could now rant about the interface (so-so), or the fact that you should reduce the color-screen brightness to about 10% to save the battery as well as turn off the WI-FI when not in use, and so forth, but how does it work when reading a book.If you are like me, and read fairly fast, most books will be a real page turners, since there is not much on a page compared to a real print on paper book. The print is clear. It is faily black on a slightly grey background (some might say off-white), which under a bright reading light is quite comfortable. For the eyesight challenged, there are bigger fonts accompanied with still more page turning. The same is true of the KINDLE. Page turning is easy and intuitive, so not a problem. Use the buttons on the side, not the color interface.A big feature of the NOOK is the ability to add a memory card. Well it is true you can do this, but it is not for the faint of heart or fingernail impaired. The first time you try to open the NOOK using the nearly invisible tab, you will wonder if you are going to break the cover. Just be careful, follow the instructions, and all will be well. Now, why would you want to add memory. As it arrives, the NOOK holds a huge number of books. You might want to add some of your work in PDF documents - this chews up space fast - and the pdf reading capability is primitive at best. Get a small netbook for this purpose and leave the NOOK for books. Changing the battery-RIGHT! Perhaps at the end of life, 2 to 3 years, to save a service trip. By then the technology will be antique, and you will replace the whole NOOK, not just the battery.A disappointment is the lack of even a primitive browser so that you could check email without lugging along another computer. The KINDLE has this feature. The NOOK can be ""upgraded"" to also have a browser, but then it is non-standard, and you might have trouble as B&N; upgrades the official firmware. Perhaps B&N; will relent and give us email capability similar to the APPLE I-Touch. I can understand not wanting to overload AT&T; with too much traffic, but simple text emails should not have been a problem.Finally, why would you want a NOOK in the first place. Remember, real books use no power, are truly random access, can be lent to anyone for as long as you like, and will function far into the future regardless of technology changes. The only purpose I can see for having a NOOK is for travel and for electronically borrowing books from a library without getting into your car or walking overmuch. Well, scratch the last, since you can borrow and read books on your computer. The airplane travel or train commute is a biggie. Books are heavy and bulky. Carrying 6 books onto an airplane is a pain. Plus, hauling out your NOOK to read makes you look technically COOL, and for the short term, is sure to start a conversation with a nearby stranger. The conversation might be interesting and better than the NOOK-book you were going to read.Well, I've written enough and am going to read a book that I just downloaded from the local library. I'll try not spill my soup on the NOOK while reading and eating -or it would become a SOUPER-NOOK.",3.0,A HALF COOKED NOOK,1263686400,"01 17, 2010",Electronics,0.0,,

It can now FF and rewind, play Windows Media Audio files, you can upload back onto your computer, and several transfer speed reductions have been made.  Also, I heard from people before I bought it that you couldn't read the current battery life, which is  not true, you can see it in the EAX&gt; System Info folder.  What you are left with is a Discman sized device, though slightly heavier, which can actually hold 150 cd's worth of of music.  I've actually begun running out of music before I've even COME CLOSE to running out of space.  The quality is excellent, I've been using the headphones which were included and they seem very nice, too.  The batteries were said to be a problem, but actually carry it on the train every day and all I have to do is plug it in overnight.  So if you know anyone who could use the equivalent of an over-sized CD binder, and have 420 bucks to spend, make someone's Christmas happy.",5.0,"After Firmware upgrade, one cable little machine",977184000,"12 19, 2000",Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,1.0,,

These type of stickers are probably for the kid at heart in all of us.  They aren&#8217;t really expensive, but have that delightful charm and a little bit of bling my iPad needs.  My problem was trying to decide which sticker I was going to dress it up with.  I finally settled on the marble-like swirled design and put it on my home button.  When removing the stickers from their paper storage holder, simply slip the tip of your fingernail beneath one edge and pull lightly. The easiest way to position the sticker is to lick your pointer finger to get it into the position you want, carefully apply, and press it down.If you miss and get it into a position you don&#8217;t like, simply pull the sticker off and start again.  Some people are actually collecting these reusable stickers to personalize their iOS devices.  The Toddy home button stickers are quite functional in one regard.  If you are trying to find your home button in a darkened room, the colored buttons make it quite easy to spot and feel.  The sticker I selected adds a bit of charm to my iPad and when I get tired of it, I can easily swap it out for a different design.The nice thing about these home button stickers is that they are made out of a very durable feeling material.  As I mentioned before, they are reusable, a factor to keep in mind if you are counting your pennies.  They are also lightweight and scratch-resistant (I tried).  The black and white flower design home button is a complimentary color for iOS devices, but jazzing them up with this assortment now makes them look less drab.  Necessary?  Maybe not, but they are certainly a fun way to add a bit of personality to your iOS device.Sample provided for review.",5.0,A fun and funky way to spruce up your IOS device and give it a bit of personality ...,1387152000,"12 16, 2013",Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,,"{'CS': 0.956343096, 'MNR': 0.181818182, 'RB': 2.0, 'RC': 492.0, 'PR': 97.76422764, 'NR': 1.219512195, 'FR': 0.095528455, 'RSP': 0.0, 'AW': 1982.0, 'RD': 0.222222222, 'RL': 1785.0, 'ER': 1.0, 'PC': 1.324041812}",0.0

Boycotting Amazon so purchased Nook. Took it out of box. A little heavier than expected. Didn't get a chance to handle one at the store (B&N;). Viewing screen is smaller than a paperback book, so not sure why my wife wanted it anyway.I created an account on B&N; but failed to add credit card info because it wasn't required. Tried to register. It seemed stuck on 'Registering Nook, should only take a few moments"" screen. It never gave any indication as to why it wouldn't finish registering. So, wife read instructions and noted that a Credit Card must be added to account. Did so and it registered relatively quickly.Purchased a cover for it the next day (relatively expensive).Wife finally picked a book. I went to B&N; website, purchased the Nook version online. Waited the promised 60 seconds and it wasn't on the Nook. Went to the website and it said it 'Hasn't been delivered yet'. What??? (My credit card was charged within a millisecond but the book wasn't delivered? After 2 hour wait, finally called their tech support. Foreign gentleman told me to wait until the morning and check again (although he did say ""I don't want to set an expectation of delivery time"" [I don't think he was supposed to say that out loud]). So, I purchase an ebook and it still takes 14 hours to deliver????? Certainly DID NOT meet my expectation. I thought I could be on a beach, purchase the book and it be on my Nook before the Margarita arrived. That is what they lead you to believe.Anyways, woke up in the morning and turned it on. Book was finally there.So, so far, doesn't meet my expectations. Not sure if Kindle would do any better, but as stated, wasn't buying an Amazon product.UPDATE: Jan 4. Well, I was wrong. When I said book was there, I guess it was in a 'list' on my nook. Apparently you still have to 'download' it. So, I hit the 'download' button. All I'm getting is ""Download Queued: Will Complete Shortly"". That's been on there for an hour. I'm waiting for tech support. I am seriously considering taking it back tomorrow. I will, of course, forfeit the $30+ I spent for a cover at best buy, but at this point that is the lesser of two evils. BN website actually says ""Download wirelessly in seconds!""UPDATE2: Jan 10. Before I returned my Nook to BN, I decided to try to download the book at work. The Nook connected to our wireless and downloaded pretty quickly. So... it appears that even though the Nook shows fully connected to my home wireless, with great reception, there is still a problem there. I'm not sure why the Nook doesn't at least tell me that there is a problem though. (it's not my internet connect, on night in question tested download speeds on wirelessly connected laptop and got outstanding results). Anyways, didn't return Nook and will bump up rating to 3 stars. Still don't care much for it telling me wireless is fine (but it isn't) and don't care for BN website.

In the era before computer games (which make this sort of game a lot easier), my brother and I used to play games of &#34;clean-out,&#34; where we'd ignore the target amount of treasure we were supposed to earn and instead would clear out the entire dungeon and compare totals at the end.So when I saw this new version being released, I picked up a copy for my family and his. I'm very pleased with the result: The board is now on board game stock and the teeny tiny cards are replaced with larger ones, and aren't required to be placed all over the board ahead of time. (Tokens are now used to denote which rooms have been cleared, which is a sensible improvement.) The basic rules are actually printed on the board, which is a good thing, since the actual instructions are a little unclear about some rules and aren't organized terribly well.The little generic plastic tokens have been replaced with cardboard standees, two for each character class, one male and one female. The classes have changed since 1979 -- elves, heroes, superheroes and wizards have been replaced with their functional equivalents of halflings, clerics, fighters and wizards -- and some of the monsters have been replaced. All of the art has: The very old school D&D; art of the original has been replaced with what looks like art culled from the third and fourth editions of Dungeons & Dragons, which is either a feature or a bug, depending on your tastes.But the total package is put together better than the original, the map, while technically identical, has been redrawn with better and clearer art and adding the rules to the board makes play go a lot faster. I'm thrilled with this new edition and curious about what this summer's refresh of the game (in time for the release of the fifth edition of Dungeons & Dragons, which this serves as a gateway drug for) will do to it.For regular use, I'd recommend getting some Reaper Bones miniatures instead of using the unsatisfying cardboard standees -- compare those with the plastic miniatures inside a game of Talisman, for instance, and you can see which will be more fun for kids -- and maybe some cooler dice from Chessex.But this is a great relatively quick family board game. We play it regularly with our six-year-old, who's the master of swooping in on treasures dropped by wounded family members in battle. (And, perhaps wisely, this edition doesn't include rules for players fighting each other, just monsters.)Definitely recommended for fans of the original and those looking for a way to introduce younger family members to the world of Dungeons & Dragons.",5.0,Better than the original,1390953600,"01 29, 2014",Toys_and_Games,1.0,,

Puzzles are great for motor skills and problem solving, especially for young minds.My 2 1/2 year old niece loves puzzles, so Mudpuppy at the Zoo was an instant hit.  She is drawn to the cute animals and bright colors.  She still has trouble picking out how the picture goes together, but the shape of the puzzle pieces helps her to solve it.  She needs some help with the puzzle, so a 2 year age recommendation may not work in all cases.  But she learns teamwork and problem-solving skills.The pieces are a little thicker than traditional pieces, easier for smaller hands to grip and piece together.  Although it is still cardboard, the extra thickness makes it more durable.  The construction of the pieces is great and should last repeated puzzling, even with a toddler.  I would caution putting the puzzle together on softer surfaces like carpet or padded tables, the pieces are more likely to bend faster.  I especially like that it is made from recycled paper and nontoxic soy-based inks.I recommend this puzzle and this company to toddlers, or those who would supply them with puzzles.

It is perfect for someone who is just starting out playing D&D; or upgrading as a player to 3.5 from a previous version.  The product contains a nice set of dice, some helpful brochures on how to create a character, and best of all a paperback version of the player's handbook!  It also comes with a character sheet as well, but this is not as helpful because the 4 page pdf ones from the Wizards of the Coast Website are better in my opinion. If you play the mini's game or just collect the minis for roleplaying like me, you will be treated to a booster pack from the Aberrations (now out of print) set.  The figures that you can get from the pack alone could justify paying the $20.00 for this kit.All this being said,  there is not much here for a Dungeon Master.  If you are new to being DM, I would recommend the Core rule book gift set instead.Dungeons & Dragons Core Rulebook Set (Dungeons & Dragons d20 3.5 Fantasy Roleplaying, Three Book Slipcased Set)What I usually do as DM, however, is purchase one of these sets for all of my new players and keep the minis pack.In summary:If you are a new player and don't have a player's handbook, buy this for yourself.If you are a DM, you may want to buy it for each of your players (or make them buy it themselves), but you probably won't need it.Hope this helps.",5.0,Great Product for someone new to D&D,1182902400,"06 27, 2007",Toys_and_Games,1.0,,

This one blew me away. It tastes as good as any premium ice cream from the store, with a rich creamy texture, and has remained easy to scoop. I could actually put this into a cone, unlike many homemade ice creams. Even buying organic eggs and organic cream, this came out to about half what I would have paid in the store. Ben and Jerry's original recipe calls for using raw eggs and I didn't want to do that, so I cooked the milk and eggs as a custard base. I was a little concerned that the quanities would not be enough for my family of four, but the ice cream is so rich that we've had a bit left over each time. I plan to get a LOT of use out of this machine! I bought a refurbished model and then had second thoughts after I read reviews by people whose machines gave out or simply didn't chill the ice cream. When I got my machine it looked brand new and it works like a charm!I froze the canister for about 21 hours before using it, just to make sure it was frozen solid. Chilled the ingredients and folded any additions in after the ice cream was churned.

I first bought Legend of Drizzt (easiest of the three) and found it to be a superb dungeon romp. Castle Ravenloft is brutal, a meatgrinder. WOA takes the middle ground, for the most part. There are times where something leads to multiple monsters spawning at one time. If you are playing two-player or solo, this will wear you down. One scenario calls for you to take out 12 monsters. Sounds simple, right? It would be simple, except that Ashardalon's card is in that deck, too. EVERY time we play this scenario, Ashardalon's card shows up late in the game, usually when the healing surges are already used up. Still, this game is quite a bit easier than Castle Ravenloft, tougher than Legend of Drizzt.AS with all of these Adventure series boardgames, the miniatures are the cheapest RPG miniatures you will find. The dungeon floor tiles are nice and can also be used to generate random dungeons for tabletop AD&D.; Also, the Dungeon Command game sets can be integrated into these adventure series games. Simply take the cards provided, shuffle them into your game monster deck. BAM! New monsters to torment you. (With painted miniatures) I take Two different Dungeon Command card sets, shuffle one of them into these games to add an extra flavor to the game. For example, shuffle Blood of Gruumsh into WOA to fight a lot of Orcs and their homies. The game will have a decidedly Orc-centric flavor. Shuffle Tyranny of Goblins into Legend of Drizzt, for a strong goblin aroma.Buy any or all of these Adventure System games, they are simple, fast-playing, co-op (mostly) and above all, FUN!",4.0,WOA completes the trifecta,1369094400,"05 21, 2013",Toys_and_Games,1.0,,

However, there was no USB modem driver included, so I had to hunt one down.  Here's what I've found out so far:CABLE LETS YOU LOAD MUSIC INSTANTLY:Using the cable alone, Plug N Play detects your phone as a storage device and allows you to load music by dragging and dropping mp3's in the appropriate folder using Explorer or syncing with Windows Media Player. Media Player thinks it has to convert all the files it loads, even though the phone plays high grade mp3's just fine, so you may want to manually drag and drop music onto your phone.I put an 8GB Mini SD card in my phone before using the cable so I don't know if it would work without having an SD card--though without one you certainly won't have much space for music.TO GAIN ACCESS TO YOUR PHONE WITH BITPIM/USE AS A MODEM:BitPim allows you to download data like your calendar, contact list, messages, pictures and video onto your PC.I installed BitPim but it wouldn't talk to my phone because I didn't have a driver.  I looked around on all kinds of shady freeware sites but I'm too much of a novice to get anything to work.  Then I looked on [...] and found VZAccess Manager, which basically enables your phone to be used as a modem for your PC.  After installing it my phone is able to communicate with BitPim, and I have the ability to connect to the internet (although I would only use the phone to connect in a dire emergency since I'm not on any kind of data plan).If you're not a Verizon user I believe VZAccess Manager would still let your phone talk to a program like BitPim, though you probably couldn't use the internet.",4.0,"Verizon User: Loading Music, Data Back-Up, USB Modem",1243036800,"05 23, 2009",Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,,"{'CS': 0.0, 'MNR': 0.0, 'RB': 0.0, 'RC': 0.0, 'PR': 0.0, 'NR': 0.0, 'FR': 0.0, 'RSP': 1.0, 'AW': 0.0, 'RD': 0.2, 'RL': 1645.0, 'ER': 0.0, 'PC': 9.419743783}",0.0

So far everything works as expected. I use them in a Fenix P3D Premium 100 (Luxeon Rebel LED, 11 - 200 lumens), and a Fenix P1 CE (Cree 7090 XR-E LED - 90 lumens). For me the performance is very acceptable considering how inexpensive the kit was. I get maybe an hour to 1-1/2 hours total runtime depending which brightness levels I'm using. I don't use the lights for more than 10 or 15 minutes at a time anyway so that's plenty of uses between charges for me.A nice plus is you get the car charger adapter included, too. Most kits require you to buy that separately at additional cost. Probably the only thing I would have liked with the kit is some kind of pouch to keep it all together. I made a carrying case out of an old zippered memory card/battery case I had hanging around. It just happens to all fit perfectly but it took an awful lot of finagling to make that happen!UPDATE 11-14-09I just wanted to update this review to say I am still using these cells and they are still working great. I think the runtime has improved after a few charge/recharge cycles (which is what is supposed to happen), so these are lasting even longer in my lights now. I only recharge them maybe every 4 months with occasional use of my lights. Still highly recommended.UPDATE 11-17-2010I guess it's time for my now yearly update on these batteries. They are still all going strong! I still only recharge them about every 4 months but that's because they have a very good charge retention and capacity.Another big surprise involving these batteries occurred over the summer (2010). I keep my Fenix P1 CE light on my keychain. To turn the light on and off you screw and unscrew the head slightly. If you unscrew it all the way the head comes off (that how you replace the battery). I guess the head had loosened in my pocket because one day as I was walking to my car I removed my car keys from my pocket. I stepped on something hard and happened to look down to see what it was. Well, it turned out to be one of these batteries! I had slightly deformed the top of the battery and ripped part of the plastic that makes up the case of the battery. I didn't have anything to lose so I trimmed off the plastic that was torn, and sealed the case up with some super glue. Fortunately, the battery still fit in the flashlight and it worked fine - still had a full charge! I've since charged it twice and it is still working great. STILL HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",4.0,Good Kit For the Price.,1229644800,"12 19, 2008",Electronics,1.0,,

I read the reviews, which were mostly positive....in my opinion the mask is below expectation.  Do not buy this if you are expecting anything better.The visor is half vinyl, half plastic visor.  Not sure why. You can see this in the stock photo, and I should have noticed it before purchasing because its not what I would expect.The overall shape of the helmet is just not quite right. It seems to be constructed too narrow overall.  The bottom of the ""visor"" is tapered outward from the top, and is then too wide at the bottom. The profile of the mask also extends outwards.  The paint job is not that great.  The red is very dull.  Its also lacks the contrast of the greens on the mask.The only pro's is that its a helmet, not a mask, and it has the dent in the top..and an antenna that leans to one side..Thats all the positives I can find.I do not try to find the negatives, but I find the mask is below expectations.

I do small projects in my garage using a table saw, radial arm saw and various sanders to make small boxes with multiple sides.  The lids are made of wedges glued together on a backer of the same wood.  In order for sixteen little pieces to fit tightly (eight sided lid) the angles must be exact.  This tool enables me to achieve the accuracy I need.  For those who might wonder, it does come with a pencil that appears to be .05 mm.  Using this instrument I can mark any angle down to .5 degree, using a magnifier I can mark as close as .25 degrees (doubt I can cut that close).  Warning: this protractor is a delicate instrument and needs to be treated as such.  Don't be surprised if you notice smudges when you first begin handling the instrument, this is simply oil from your fingers being transferred to the aluminum.  This bothered me a little so I rubbed it down with a bit of cooking oil and wiped it clean.  I look forward to many years of using this wonderful tool.In that the protractor is only 6&#34; wide it will only extend marks 3&#34; out from center, with care one could probably extend these marks another three or four inches without too much loss in accuracy.

Feinberg ""Philip Feinberg""","[2.0, 2.0]","For background info purposes, let me first say that my Samsung is rooftop antenna-connected via an RF modulator, and it is not connected to any other units (VCR, DVD player, ...). This is the same setup I maintained with the 18 year old TV the Samsung replaced, and I simply ended up reusing the RF modulator as a preference option. This decision, however, turned out to be one supported by a Samsung tech support person, who said that the modulator would enhance the picture quality all the more.Whether or not picture quality is enhanced by the modulator connection, I cannot say, as I haven't tried my setup without it. All I can say is that the picture quality is excellent, and that is without having had to do any adjustment tweaking (sharpness, contrast, brightness, ....). Thus, I would rate picture quality as my Samsung's best, most satisfying attribute.I am also pleased with the user-friendly remote. The numerals are generously large, and are color-contrasted with the remote's black background, which adds to visibility ease. Other icon and identifier buttons are likewise easy to ID and access. Moreover, buttons are nicely clustered, enabling easy location/activation.Samsung also gets kudos for the user-friendly owner's guide, which even I --- a tech-challenged hater of instruction manuals --- was able to navigate for set-up and adjustments, thanks to the thorough and easy to follow, step-by-step instructions and helpful illustrations. I surprised myself by completing the set-up, including programming the remote, with little angst and no tantrums!With regard to dissatisfaction, I would rate Samsung's overall sound quality as its primarily negative feature. It is woefully sub-standard and most disappointing. Without exaggeration, the sound quality emitted by this Samsung model is actually inferior to that of my old TVs, low-end computer, and even my inexpensive radios. The sound is tinny and""echoey"". And unfortunately,neither the manual-based sound adjustment options nor Samsung tech support contacts were able to completely overcome the sound deficiencies. I'm thinking that the type and location of the TV's speakers --- on the bottom of the unit --- may be part of the problem. However, I was able, by strictly trial and error, to achieve some sound improvement by playing around with the bandwidth adjustments (per the Sound Customizing section of the manual). I have since found that the sound quality, whether due to my happenstance adjustments or not, is just a bit improved, but tends to vary with channel (including digital), as well as with voice vs. music output. Actually, at times, the music-based sound comes through well. I don't understand the sound variability enigma here, which is somewhat annoying, but I have determined that I can live with the sound in its current state, though reluctantly so.The one other negative feature is the ridiculously small, channel ID caption square (blue background/white numerals) which appears at the top left on the screen when making a channel change. Now, my distance vision is quite good, and I have watched TV from the same distance for 32 years, never having a problem seeing any emergent captions, etc. on any TV. But with this Samsung, especially when channel surfing, I literally have to get up from the couch and move a bit closer to the TV to see the caption figures. And with the multitude of adjustments that one canmake for so many of the Samsung features, you'd think that the caption could be enlarged. But alas, a Samsung contact revealed no such option.Would I have purchased this Samsung, based on knowing what I know now relative to the above? I think I'd probably opt to check out other Samsung models or other brands altogether beforehand, which is my recommendation to other potential buyers.",3.0,"Samsung, a So-So",1238716800,"04 3, 2009",Electronics,,"{'CS': 0.361026943, 'MNR': 0.0, 'RB': 0.0, 'RC': 1.0, 'PR': 100.0, 'NR': 0.0, 'FR': 0.0, 'RSP': 0.0, 'AW': 0.0, 'RD': 1.180451128, 'RL': 3800.0, 'ER': 0.0, 'PC': 1.55604954}",0.0

If I use this coffee maker as a regular standard type maker then cleaning is no different than any other.  What everyone is talking about for cleaning, is when you use the system to grind beans and make coffee.  As the hot water goes through the coffee grounds after it grinds, the steam condenses all through out the system making the residual ground in the grinder wet.  So, after making coffee in this manner, it needs to be taken apart and rinsed (a very simple process).  If you like coffee then this is a good system for the price.

Prior to that I had a Garmin 755T non-truck GPS.  One of my favorite features in that unit was the ability to plan a route by determining mileage using the stop or via feature.  What I would do is using a map I would route myself several different ways forcing the unit by putting in stops or vias at different locations along the route, otherwise, like most GPS 's, it determines what it thinks is the best route.  I could add up to 10 Via's or stop points for each route and then based on mileage and other factors determine which is the best route to take.  Multiple stops and the ability to route was the most important reason for having the Garmin.  However it was not truck specific.  And considering I am now hauling strictly hazmat I wanted something that would take that into consideration.  After perusing various forums, review sites, and word-of-mouth my choices boiled down to the Garmin 465T or the RAND McNally Intelliroute TND 700.  Even though it was quite a bit more than the Garmin I chose the TND 700 for several reasons.  The main one being the extra screen size, and its ability to coordinate with the RAND McNally truck atlas and also its ease of updating.Now on to my first impression of the TND 700.  It seems to be an aesthetically pleasing and durably built unit.  The first thing I noticed was it's very slow to boot compared to my old Garmin.  Whether this is unique to the TND 700 or is common amongst all truck specific gps units I cannot tell, but it's really not that big of a deal.  The second thing I noticed was the overwhelming wealth of information put forth.  That might explain why the manual (available via the TND dock) is well over 100 pages long.....  There is somewhat of a learning curve with this unit.  The next thing I noticed was the complexity of entering routes.  As previously mentioned I like to force it into my preferred routing by the use of stops or vias.  That was a big no go with this unit.  While you can enter multiple stops or vias it is nowhere near as user-friendly as my old Garmin.  Furthermore there is no way you can determine total mileage on the route that you have chosen, as I could with the Garmin.  Totally flummoxed by what appeared to be an omission of one of the best routing tools a trucker could have I went online and verified through an expert source connected with RAND McNally that no, that feature was a couple updates down the line and was not available at this point.  Unbelievable.  Also forcing the unit to follow a specific route can be very challenging.  For a unit of this price, and feature laden, I find this totally unacceptable.  I am still mulling over selling this unit  and buying the Garmin 465T.  I really do like this GPS, the screen is magnificent, and the volume is awesome.Another thing I've noticed, which I do not think is unique to this unit, is some of the weird routing that it does.  I've never owned a truck specific GPS before but after playing with this one for a couple of days I get the impression that what RAND MacNally (and the others that use Navteq) has done is take a plain old car specific Navteq map and a road atlas with truck restrictions and made notifications on the map.  In most databases there is not a 100% thorough listing of every road in the country.  What I mean is that this unit will route you down roads you don't belong on.  Today while coming home it tried routing me on several  9 ton County roads.  What that means is that a truck is limited to 73280 unless the road is posted at 10 tons.  County roads do not have that restriction listed in the RAND McNally road atlas, so I believe that is why it is not listed.....  Also unacceptable in a unit of this price and sold as truck specific.  However I'd be willing to bet the other truck specific units are the same way as no one has ever done a truck specific version of NavTeq.Another bone I have to pick is the POI's. Not only the truck specific ones but the others all seem to be somewhat outdated.  I think the Garmin, at least the ones that I have used, are more current.  It would also be nice if I could add my own POI'sTo sum it up I will keep this unit a little longer to see if I can make it workable.  If not I will go back to Garmin.  I like the concept and I like the unit but at this point I'll have to say I am somewhat unimpressed.pros:Large screenterrific imagesoutstanding volumecons:inability to determine route mileage by multiple stops and viasa somewhat outdated POI information.Non-truck specific routings.Cost.",3.0,1st impression,1283990400,"09 9, 2010",Electronics,0.0,,

In Ticket to Ride, you play one of five different friends who are obsessed with  Phileas Fogg, the man who went around the world in 80 days.  Based on Fogg's story, the players make a one million dollar bet to see who can make it to the most cities in seven days.  In the game, players can do one of three different things on their turn to travel across America:  collect tickets, collect routes, or spend tickets to travel.  When a player collects tickets, they draw one or two tickets.  These tickets can be one of five revealed tickets or from the draw pile.  If a player draws a wild card from the revealed tickets that is the only ticket they can draw that turn.  When a player collects routes, they draw three routes and must keep one.  Routes are worth positive points if a player has connected the cities on the card at the end of the game, but, the card could be worth negative points if the player does not complete the route.  The last action a player can do is spending tickets to place trains on the board.  To place trains on a path on the board, a player must spend enough tickets of the same color as the path.  Some paths are gray and allow the player to spend any color ticket as long as they spend the same color tickets.  Each time a player places trains on the board, they earn points based on how long the path is.  Play continues until one player has two or less trains in reserve.  Then all players get one last turn, and then the game is over.  After counting points from route cards the player with the most points wins!Theme-I'll be honest.  I've played this game a lot, but, I didn't read the story until I finally bought the game.  The story reinforces the theme decently and helps makes the title ""Ticket to Ride"" make sense.  Some of the mechanics don't quite reinforce the theme as once you have a route it doesn't leave the board.  Do you get to keep the tickets you have for that route in the game?  Do you get to keep riding the trains for free?  Why can't other players ride the same train as me?  It's not perfect, but I do feel like I'm busy trying to make it across America as fast as I can. 3.5/5Mechanics-Ticket to Ride has some of the slickest mechanics out there.  My simple summary above is almost all the rules you need to play the game.  The game is quick, fun, and family friendly for almost all ages.  Even though the game doesn't have the insane depth of some other games, a surprising amount of strategy emerges in this game.  Since goals are secrete, you never know when your best laid plans will go up in smoke.  That tension is amazing for a simple game. 5/5Instructions-The instructions are four pages.  Not four pages front and back, two pages front and back.  Since the rules are not complex, the rules don't need an epic to teach the players.  I do like the art and pictures that help to teach how to play.  Brevity is the height of wit with these rules. 5/5Execution-The box is nice and hardy.  The path indicators are cute plastic trains that are a nice addition to the game.  The board has a nice layout and is easy to read.  AND, I know the Days of Wonder LOVES me since the game comes with plastic bags for each player's components.  I absolutely love when a company does that! 5/5Summary-I love this game.  It's quick, family friendly, and always good to see making it to the table.  The theme is slightly off, but the mechanics, instructions, and execution of the game make up for that hands down.  Really worth trying if you get the chance. 92.5%",5.0,Ring Side Report- Board Game Review of Ticket to Ride,1401148800,"05 27, 2014",Toys_and_Games,1.0,,

There are a lot of rules and I think it's important to learn on a deck that's designed to function cohesively. If you are happy just having a deck to play with, then that's all you need.After that, if you are at all interested in building decks or experimenting with different play styles, I definitely recommend getting this kit. From a value perspective, it comes with 4 boosters, which by themselves are worth at least $12, and then you get a storage box with room for extra cards, which is worth a another couple of bucks, so the cards are basically free.It gives you a bunch basic cards to start putting together decks and try out different play styles. The decks probably wouldn't satisfy experienced players, but it's plenty for learning the ins and outs of how the different colors work. If that's what you're interested in, this is an economical way to get there.This kit does come with a pamphlet on deck building, but it's not very detailed.

I'm hoping it will improve my balance and also prepare me for learning how to snowboard (I've read elsewhere that it is supposed to be good training and strengthening) So far I absolutely love it. It is a GREAT workout, and it doesnt seem to get boring...even though its basically a piece of wood on top of a cylinder lolI did have a few problems... When I first ordered the board, the one that came was defective. The screw in the cylinder part was stripped, and when I was on the board, it kind of um... fell apart. BUT, it really wasn't a problem because when I called the customer service number that came with the package, they sent me a brand new board and cylinder completely FREE. And the new one is built sturdy and is fine. Another problem is that the board I'm using is starting to appear somewhat warped...it doesn't lay flat on the floor anymore... this really isn't a problem as far as performance, but I'm wondering how long the board is going to last.A few recommendations:1. DO NOT use the balance board on any rough surfaces, it will ruin the wood of the cylinder.2. The board is best on a smooth surface...wood, vinyl, tile, cement, or a very thin flat rug. It moves too slow on carpet.3. Be prepared that the first time you use the board you might feel a bit dizzy lol I did at least... but it goes away the more you use it and the more comfortable you get4. Start off holding on to something lol otherwise you may go flying... But again as you get more comfortable it becomes A LOT of fun... Some people can even do tricks with it... No clue how lol but that's what Ive heard...So overall I would definitely recommend this product for anyone who is looking for strengthening/training in balance, a good workout, or just some fun. Even with the minor problems I've had, it is still a great product and a lot less expensive then other balance boards out there.",4.0,Very Good... with a few issues,1223510400,"10 9, 2008",Sports_and_Outdoors,1.0,,

Mediocre tablet that is decent for media consumption but is limited at media creation.  Limited Out-of-the-box functionality because it seems to have been designed to require third-party apps. Total Cost of Ownership is $400.I readily admit I am not the target user Barnes and Noble (B&N;) had in mind for the NOOK Tablet.  I spend a lot of time flying for work and my needs were for a supplement to my laptop. Tablets, including the vaunted iPad, are meant for enjoying media (music, video, casual games, reading) and not for editing or creating new content.  The 7"" tablets are even more hampered by their limited screen space.  So why did I choose a 7"" tablet instead of an iPad or 10"" competitor?  Price.  The large tablets start at $600 and after adding peripherals your Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) is $900 - $1000, which is the same price as a good laptop that does everything...except run on battery for a 6+ hour flight.After a lot of online research, I settled on the NOOK Tablet.  B&N; has a 14-day return policy so I put the Tablet through rigorous functionality testing to determine whether to keep it or not.  As much as possible, I only used the built-in applications and made no changes to the hardware or software.  I will not discuss the hardware because you can find dozens of reviews online.  These are my results.Reading books. Naturally, the Tablet excels.  My concern was that it be able to remember bookmarks on multiple books and PDFs even after powering off and/or removing the SD card.  Verdict: PASSReading magazines.  B&N; tells you up front that you have to cancel your emagazine subscriptions and use their web store.  I tried reading PDF versions and online subscriptions through Zinio's website (which supports everything except NOOKs).  There just is no easy way to read multi-column magazine articles on a 7"" tablet.  This is too bad because my second reason to get a tablet was to stop carrying around 15 pounds of magazines.  Verdict: FAILReading and editing MS Office Documents and PDFs.  This is 70% of my job and the primary reason for purchasing a tablet.  The Tablet has a lite MS Office reader and a PDF reader.  Both are good at reading documents. Neither allow editing or adding notes to documents.  For about $20 you can buy excellent third-party apps that allow editing both types of documents. (Note: Animations in PowerPoint do not animate so the Tablet is not suitable for showing animated presentations.)  The virtual keyboard is the biggest limitation.  Most internal apps do not support rotation so the keyboard is not much wider than a smartphone keyboard.  You have to type with your index fingers to keep from hitting numerous keys.  Where the keyboard totally fails is a lack of cursor keys.  If you have a typo in the middle of word, there is no way to move the cursor to the exact letter you want it on.  Retyping entire words is not uncommon.  Verdict: FAILEmail.  The Tablet has email capabilities and works really well with GMAIL accounts.  However, security is appalling.  Once your enter your account and password you are never prompted for it again.  This means if someone picks up your Tablet they can read your email.  The settings can be changed to require a password to compose email, but it does not appear to work.  Enabling the 4 number passcode on the Tablet is the only security you have.  Because of this, I have not tried connecting to my work MS Exchange server and probably never will.  Verdict: FAILWeb Browsing.  The Tablet has a good web browser that supports Flash Video, which means you can watch YouTube videos.  You can keep bookmarks and open HTML pages stored on the media card. The primary browsing limitations are the screen size (and obviously need for a wireless connection).  Verdict: PASSCalendar and To-Dos.  There are no built-in apps for either of these, which seems unthinkable.  Even a basic smartphone has these.  You can download free ones from the B&N; app store.  Verdict: FAILNote Taking.  No built-in app for writing notes!  The Tablet has a microphone, but you can't even create audio notes.  Note taking is the one killer app I wanted for home use.  I write notes everywhere to the point of being buried by them.  Third-party apps saves the day.  Evernote works great with the Tablet - and supports audio notes and keyboard rotation.  Verdict: FAILMusic.  The music player is absolute garbage and there is currently no third-party alternative.  The first week the music player would skip a lot and even crash the Tablet when playing MP3s from the SD card.  Recovery was horrible because the Tablet wouldn't shut down and then wouldn't power up without being connected to the power cord.  Fortunately, a firmware update solved the instability problem.  Despite four ways of sorting music, finding and playing music in the order you want is terrible (see comments on audiobooks).  You can pause and resume a song but you cannot stop.  There is no stop button.  The speaker on the Tablet is lousy.  My two-year old Blackberry phone has a better speaker and it's 1/3rd the size of the Tablet.  The speaker is very loud though so will fill a hotel room with mediocre sound.  Surprisingly, the speaker sounds no worse even though covered up when the Tablet is in a carrying case.  Verdict: FAILAudiobooks.  You would think an ebook reader would also have good support for audiobooks.  The internal memory and media card have folders for specific media types.  You can even create your own folders on the SD card.  However, no matter where you put your media, the Tablet finds all of it and dumps it into either the music player or the media player.  There is no way to separate audiobooks from music.  Where the music player completely fails is playing audiobooks in sequential order.  Most software applications sort by reading a filename from left to right and sorting on the first character difference it finds.  The music player apparently looks at the first few characters and then the last characters and ignores the middle ones.  For example, an audiobook with multiple discs and chapters should sort by discs first (1, 2, 3) and then by chapter (1,2,3).  Instead the Tablet sorts by placing all the chapter ones together and then all the chapter twos and so one.  The file manager sorts alphabetically so you have to open the media card file manager and play audiobooks from there. Verdict: FAILPictures.  The Tablet is a pretty good electronic photo album with all the pinch-and-zoom features you expect.  However, like the music player, there's no way to segregate pictures into albums.  I loaded a document with a ton of embedded images and they ended up in the media gallery as well.  You can delete images from the gallery...except the sample pictures for some reason. Verdict: PASS (but hoping for a feature update or third-party alternative soon)Video.  NetFlix and Hulu work good over a wireless connection, but you may get lower resolutions due to the bandwidth limits of a wireless connection.  Playing stored video files requires using the media player. Even though the web browser supports Flash video, the media player does not.  As long as you convert your videos to .m4v format, you can put anything on the Tablet (Handbrake or RealPlayer is perfect for converting video on a PC/Mac).  The image quality is great, although I seem to notice a slight flicker in converted Flash videos like they are playing at 28 frames per second rather than 30.  The media player does not support scene selection/jumping to chapters in movies and has no bookmarking feature.  Unlike the music player which will play in the background, you cannot multitask.  If you leave the media player to use another app, your video will stop.  Unfortunately, videos get lumped into the media gallery with photos and the thumbnail appears to be a random still image from 1 minute into the video.  Verdict: PASS (it's a book reader, not a movie player)Total Cost of Ownership.  Currently, the Tablet costs $250.  For something designed to be used on the road, you will need an extra power supply ($25) and protective cover case ($35).  The $50 extended warranty is a requirement since the Tablet will probably be dropped and crushed frequently.  To install more than a few books, documents, and media files will require an SD card ($20 - $35).  Add another $30 to purchase third-party apps to add functionality and you have around $400 invested in the Tablet.  Purchasing ebooks and emagazines is an optional ongoing expense.Final Verdict.  As much as I tried to only use built-in apps during the trial period, when I could not get the functionality I wanted from them I was able to download a number of free or inexpensive apps.  These allow me to do the basic content creation and editing I need on the road. A B&N; employee flat out admitted the Tablet was rushed out the door with only NOOK Color functionality so was not being fully exploited yet.  The firmware update proved B&N; is committed to making the Tablet live up to its promise. Realizing that no tablet can yet replace a laptop, and the functionality and ubiquity Evernote brings, convinced me to keep the Tablet.",4.0,Good ebook reader.

Secondly, it could be a lot warmer. Lastly, and most critically, this damn thing blew out my fuses TWICE.The first time it happened, I thought it was a fluke and got an electrician to come and fix it (which was $160 out the door). The second time this thing actually melted the conduit and when the electrician come again (the VERY NEXT DAY), he showed me where the rubber formed a pool and the frayed/blacked copper wires (another $180 out the door).

This game is similar to dungeons and dragons, but, because there are no dice, the element of chance is reduced.  This leads to players mostly winning based on solid strategy.  However, the order and creature cards drawn in a turn do add a lot of suspense, since you never know what kind of trick your opponent has up his sleeve.The greatest aspect of the game is that once you have multiple faction packs you can create your own custom warband.  And you can play your combination of creatures and order cards against your friend's warband.  You can even play this game with unlimited players, however, I think that six is as high as you should consider going since you are not going to want to wait through everyone else's turn (as the turns are long and slow).There are better games than this, but this is very well designed and very unique.  Also, every few months a new faction pack of dungeon command is being released and the ability of a player to design a custom warband increases with each release.

Zug ""Board Game Fanatic""","[1, 1]","I bought Lords of Waterdeep for friends, and we played several times after I had given it to them.  I have enjoyed worker placement games like Stone Age, and this game is a nice addition to that genre.  It's a bit complicated for the novice game player, hence why I didn't give it the highest rating, but it has a good dynamic and the D&D theme is blended sweetly into the mechanics.  If you enjoy worker placement games, you will be attracted to this one.  I also liked the intrigue cards that provide a way to slow down an opponent who is gaining too much momentum.  This simple addition adds game balance that some worker placement games (like Phoenicia) lack.  The secrecy of which Lord of Waterdeep that you represent throughout the game also adds to this balance.  It takes a solid two hours to play the game (at least with my group of friends/gamers), so it's not a light play, but that doesn't detract its appeal for me since I play many games of that nature.  However, if you have limited time for your gaming, this is not the game for you.  It also has a lot of bits and pieces, so play does involve some organization and time consumption in setting up and putting it away.  That many bits also means that you want to be careful about not losing any since each of the pieces are instrumental to the game's play.  It is definitely not a travel game due to this and the size of the box.  Overall I recommend it, and on a scale of 1-10 would rate it a 7.",4.0,Really Good Worker Placement Game,1374019200,"07 17, 2013",Toys_and_Games,1.0,,

""Purple"" is quirky and unexpected where ""Core"" was more predictable hard core grunge but ""Purple"" is also the much, much better album both in the quality of the songwriting and the complexity of the ideas of the tracks.No doubting that ""Core"" has a few killer tracks and ""Plush"" with its simple and yet complex sounding chords made me and my band want to cover as many of their tracks as we could but we found that we ended up covering more tracks on ""Purple"" instead because they were more interesting and fun to play.  That's the beauty of STP in that the De Leo brothers were never shy of experimenting with chords and they would purposely avoid playing a standard chord and look for more exotic ones to substitute them with.  ""Plush"" is a great example of this and it's so simple to play that even though all these years I haven't played it on the guitar, I still feel confident I can simply pick up my guitar and still play 90% of the piece without error.""Purple"" is almost like a jazz album in the way it's written and is a real enigma to me even to this day.  Starting out with the brilliant ""MeatPlow"" that is overflowing with exotic-sounding chords, the album moves on to one of my old band's favourite songs to warm up to, ""Vasoline"", and carries on to what can only be described as what country music would sound grunge style in ""Interstate Love Song"" one of my band's favourite tracks to cover.  The riffs and the intro has a distinctly country feel about them.Then we get the acoustic and excellent ""Pretty Penny"" which is a joy to play if you are into folk guitar because yet again, we get to play exotic chords all the way.  ""Big Empty"" is simply another beautiful track and is one of their best ever.  ""Unglued"" is the ultimate jam song and one of the easiest to play but sounds very complex indeed.All the tracks flow very nicely here and like any classic album, move the tracks in any other order and the overall album suffers for it.  I can't wait for a proper remastering job on this album and on ""Core"" with perhaps a mini-lp sleeve packaging design thrown in as well.By far, STP's best album and one of the best grunge albums of all time.  This is that rare album that both casual fans and musicians can truly appreciate as a genuine work of art.Very highly recommended!",5.0,STP's Best Album By a Country Mile!

A random tile will be selected and added to the board as the Hero explores the ""dungeon."" A new monster will appear with each new tile. It can be challenging if the heroes starts flipping more tiles and made more than one monster appear at a time. You roll on behalf of the monster and yourself in a battle, so if you are bad with dice, then the monster would share your good share of roll too.You will have to pay attention to the powers and items that your Hero has and this could be the like it or hate it thing for people who never played any D&D; before. You will have at least 6 cards that you can choose from for your Hero each time it goes into battle and being familiar with them can be hard for new players.Overall, it is a fun game.

Interacting and playing with it is extremely addictive and I have hooked my boss and another coworker by giving them each one.When I was younger I made crystal models out of marbles and geodesic domes out of cardboard and remember the excitement of uncovering different relationships between the shapes.

I forgot how much fun I had doing those explorations as a kid and can't figure out why I ever stopped.  The Ball of Whacks includes the symmetries of all five platonic solids if you play with it long enough.I would suggest getting a couple of them - at least one for your desk and one for playing at home.  You may need extras to share with family and colleagues and they are fun to combine into larger constructions as well.In creative problem solving sessions with coworkers I like to bring in various toys both to stimulate their playfulness and to change their environment a bit.

It's got good voice recognition software and the use of pictures and the way it tests you to make sure you understand what's going on, allows users to build vocabulary quickly.Note:::There will be a portion of the population, like myself, that will absolutely need to have the system of conjugation written down for them to `see' the logic of it, but that doesn't really detract from the software in my opinion.What does detract is the ""beta"" feel of the administrative part of the software.  Installation and maintenance have been a royal pain in the tuckus.I think my husband described it best when he said:  `Their software is very tightly scripted, but not very adaptive.  If your system is at all different from what the Rosetta Stone programmers anticipated, you will on the phone with the help desk for considerable time.'  That said, their help desk was helpful.INSTALLATION:::  Installation wasn't all that smooth for us.  After we installed the software, it gave us a notice that we needed to upgrade our O/S (a new service pack) and a new version of the Rosetta Stone software's engine. Plus there was some difficulty getting the headphones working, but I can't recall now exactly where the problem lay.MAINTENANCE:::  Yes, who knew there was maintenance.True to form, everything was running exceedingly smoothly for my husband, myself, and my 10 year-old daughter UNTIL the pop-up of death appeared that demanded that it be allowed to install an update.  Being a cautious soul I tried to back out as I `didn't want an update thank you', but guess what.  The software would no longer work.  No more French learning without the update :(Well, since that was a no go, I allowed the  update.  And guess what.  No more French learning.  In fact, the update hosed things up for a good long while, at least until someone had time to call the help desk and spend a good hour fixing the problem.It was amazing how much information was needed to do this.  We had to give the tech not only the Rosetta Stone key, but also  everything about our computer including the clock rate. Go figure. I suppose they are adding to their database trying to narrow in on where the problems are coming from.In any case, it turned out that there was a hidden file that needed to be deleted.  This file told the system that the upgrade was in progress, when in fact it had failed.  There was also a problem that stemmed from the fact that we have different profiles on this particular computer.  One for adults, one for kids.  In the end though that was resolved as well.THE SKINNY:::You are probably surprised by the 4-Stars I've given this program.  But honestly I don't think there's anything that compares to the Rosetta Stone method of learning.My advice would be to only install this software on a newer machine and if possible not allow that computer to connect to the internet until you are ready to use the online features.  These, by the way, will only work with one profile.Pam T~mom/newish French student",4.0,Love-Hate Relationship with Rosetta Stone,1289606400,"11 13, 2010",Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,1.0,,

Let me start off by saying it works as advertised.  But that won't get you 5 stars.  The problem is installation.  Maybe it's my own fault for thinking all TV wall mounts worked like the Peerless I had.  See, that one has a separate TV plate that you screw to the TV first.  Then you have the second piece (the actual wall mount) that you screw to the wall.  Once that's done, using the bracket mounted on the TV, you hang the TV on the wall mount and secure it with a single bolt.  One person can easily put a TV on the wall.Not so much with this one.  Yes, I will admit that once it's mounted, it's a more secure connection, but it's the mounting that's the problem.  You can't do it alone.  Depending on the weight of the TV, you will need at least one helper.  This mount is one piece, which means that you have to hold the TV to the wall-mounted plate while attaching it with screws.  That can get tricky, especially with heavier TVs (I used it for a while with my old LCD TV which weighs 40+ pounds).

Twenty-five years later, I donated the Waring machine because I no longer had the patience to bother with all that sloppy ice cube & salty mess! (Machine still worked; donated it to my church). I did tons of online research and hands down, THIS machine got top ratings no matter what site I visited. Some places offer a 2nd bowl for an additional price but I knew I wouldn't need that much ice cream. VERY QUIET and made the 2nd batch of peach ice cream in record time; set timer for 30 minutes, it was done in 18 minutes! Easy to clean, very small to store; bowl is kept permanently in deep freeze at 0 degrees.NOTE: The miniscule Cuisinart recipe book that comes with this states that the bowl will be frozen within 6-12 hours. Don't believe it, we did and almost returned the machine! I checked the canister after 10 hours and it didn't slosh one bit, but after one hour of processing the cream mixture, it was no more frozen than the Equator! Saved the cream mixture to try the next day; froze it for 24 hours, and as I said above, it made a batch in 18 minutes, flat.I've also noticed that although it says ""generous 1.5 quart size"" my recipe for 1 quart of ice cream came so close to the top of the dasher that it actually flowed over a bit. So, I'm going to use slightly less than 1 cup measurements for the liquids when I make the next batches to avoid this problem.So far we've made peach, strawberry and banana ice cream. Try using a high quality buttermilk for 1 cup of the liquid; it's low calorie and adds a nice twang to the end result.",5.0,Finally!

We have four cats and it does a great job picking up the cat hair.  It's very quiet and powerful.  Like our previous Eureka, the ""Power Paw"" is next to useless on carpets (try the Eureka Easy Clean instead), but might be good on upholstery or bare floors.Our main gripes are the dust canister and the ""retracting cord.""  The dust canister empties from the bottom, which is great when it actually contains dust.  Unfortunately, this vacuum is marketed for for pets.  As I said, it picks up pet hair like crazy, but it doesn't come out!  We have to reach in and pull a wad of cat hair our every time we empty the dust canister.The cord retractor is weak.  It decelerates as the plug approaches the vacuum, presumably to avoid damage.  Unfortunately, this means the cord must be laid out perfectly straight and perpendicular to the opening for it to work properly.  That may not sound bad, but that cord is long!Bottom line: performance is great, probably worth the annoyance of manually de-furring the dust can.  Definitely save a couple bucks and avoid the cord retractor and power paw if that's an option.UPDATE, February 2014So . . . we had a pretty serious and annoying breakdown with the vacuum. My husband left a t-shirt on the floor and then sucked it up with the vacuum (insert stereotype joke here), which broke it.  We didn't expect the vacuum to survive the experience unscathed; but the WAY the vacuum broke resulted in dropping this rating to 1 star.The carpet brush on this vacuum is driven directly from the main motor by two belts, instead of having its own motor.  One of the belts is cogged and not easily replaceable.  The second is smooth and clearly designed to be easily replaced.  The ""on/off"" lever for the brush increases or decreases tension on the smooth belt to engage the brush.  The Eureka engineers clearly spent a lot of time designing this mechanism so that this belt, and ONLY this belt, is easy to replace.  It's also the only belt-maintenance listed in the manual.Logically, after so much effort, the engineers would have made sure that THIS belt would fail if anything (like a careless husband's t-shirt) got jammed in the brush.  Unfortunately for us, that's not the case.  Instead of the belt failing, a plastic sprocket that connects the two belts stripped on its inner diameter, causing the sprocket to spin uselessly and generate a nasty burning plastic smell.After disassembling nearly the entire vacuum, my husband was able to locate this sprocket and order the replacement parts - for nearly $40!  The belt is less than $10.  We paid about $160 dollars for the vacuum, and this simple (and probably very common) repair cost a quarter as much as the vacuum to repair, despite the misplaced efforts of the Eureka engineers.  I hate to think what it would have cost in a repair shop.The Eureka engineers need to return to the drawing board (or CAD station), but this time with their customers' interests in mind.",1.0,UPDATE: Great Performance - Questionable Ergonomics - Terrible Mechanics,1376092800,"08 10, 2013",Home_and_Kitchen,,"{'CS': 0.682224555, 'MNR': 1.0, 'RB': 3.0, 'RC': 3.0, 'PR': 100.0, 'NR': 0.0, 'FR': 0.0, 'RSP': 0.0, 'AW': 0.0, 'RD': 2.533333333, 'RL': 3020.0, 'ER': 1.0, 'PC': 1.309328969}",0.0

I can run Age of Conan, one of the most graphically intensive games on the market, at 100% full blown settings and get 70-100 fps (frames per second).  Only when the action gets majorly intense with large numbers of other players casting huge spell effects does the fps drop to about 25.  As a comparison, my ""old, but highpowered gaming machine"" with an Nvidia 9800 ran at low settings at 40 fps, and would drop as low as 5 in major PvP action sequences.You may be concerned that there is not enough RAM or hard drive space.  Don't worry.  500GB Hard drive is more than enough for most people, but the system has four more hard drive bays, so don't be afraid to buy a second one later.  And the hard drive mounting system is one of the easiest to work that I've ever seen.The 6 Gb RAM is more than adequate for optimum performance, BUT the machine has 6 DIMM slots and only 3 are used.

Firstly, there was no foam around the face side, so my skin is touching the composite frame. Fitting, on the other hand, was quite nice. The way it forms to the face is quite comfortable with or without a helmet or other head gear....I only wish it were a little easier to smile with them on.Anyways, the second issue I ran into with buying used was that both of the lenses were better suited for simulated drunk vision than optical protection. This didn't matter too much with the smoke lens, since it's already meant to block UV rays. The real issue is fogging. Used lenses don't have the same anti-fog capabilities as brand new ones (When wearing a mask with the goggles, my breath goes right up into the frame and doesn't even leave a spot).With that said, get them brand new, and if your lenses start to go bad--which is hard to achieve--then just get a new lens. The frames look pretty durable and stand up to a lot impact and jostling. The elastic may become a problem with repeated, heavy use but thus is life.Another word of warning aside from buying them new: Follow ESS' instructions on maintenancing the lenses. I had my suspicions on the murkiness of the lenses, thinking heavy usage until I saw &#34;Don't use cleaning solvents,&#34; and my girlfriend suggested that someone might have tried to use Windex.

Admittedly, Valentina does not look as good out of the box as she does in the Amazon picture. While her face is aristocratic, her hair is soft and beautifully highlighted, and her make-up is the best I've seen on a Bratz doll so far, but she just doesn't look as classy as she does on Amazon. But I love her none-the-less, because she is beautiful and fits into every look I've tried on her from my (extensive) collection of Bratz outfits. Orianna has pearly lips remeniscent of the 60s Barbies, and if you don't like her in the Amazon picture, you won't like her when you get her. She does have a way of growing on you, but I ended up giving Orianna to my younger sister because she loved her more than I did. Both of the twins come in well-made clothes, butValentina's jacket is easier to take off than to put on. Both of them wear boots, yet they are a bit hard to put on. Once you put them on, though, they dolls look stunnig. Accessory-wise, Orianna comes with an awesome guitar and Valentina comes with a case holding two fashion sketches. Generally, these dolls have a large replay value because you can easily mix and match their clothes and accessories with other Bratz sets. This is the perfect present for any Bratz lover, and while I mentioned several negative points, both dolls are incredibly beautiful.

I had a Riovolt first but it was hopeless at playing CD-RW discs (yes it said CD-RW compatitable on the box), then I had an Archos 6000 that melted (literally) when it was charging.So purchasing the Nomad and its a dream come true. I can store 2500 96bit/sec high quality WMA files (WMA is better than MP3), arrange the songs into albums, genres, artists and playlists, which is a godsend when looking up a specific song or to play songs in a specific order. One feature which is so handy that it brought tears to my eyes, is the ability to add songs to the active playlist as you go, without interupting the current song playing. The included software is easy to use and enables CD ripping, organizing and titleing of your favourite songs. It only takes a few moments to transfer a lot of files through the included USB lead.The unit itself is a very sleek silver-blue affair that has high-quality fixtures, positive-acting buttons and a very clear backlit LCD that has a very easy-to-understand menu system, backed up by 3 navigation buttons that aid you through the menus. The drive unit itself is very quiet and smooth and is responsive when navigating songs.The unit has oodles of sound-tweaking modes such as a graphic equaliser, environment settings and stereo wide modes, but even in normal mode, the unit sounds so damn good you'll hardly use the sound modes. Hook it up to your stereo via its Line out and the sound quality is amazing, it rivals a CD player.Some customers complain that the unit 'skips' but I don't have a habit of bashing my Nomad on the floor and when its safely tucked away in my pocket, it never ever skips when im walking or running. Also the battery life is very acceptable (I can squeeze 6 hours out of mine) if you follow the charging procedures, and in fairness to Creative Labs, you do get 2 packs of NimH batteries. What more do you want?!Overall this player is so damn good if it was a woman i'd marry it and I hope to keep this player for many years to come, (its THAT good) :-)",5.0,If this Nomad was a woman i'd marry it!,1017619200,"04 1, 2002",Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,1.0,,

Fulkerson,"[2, 2]","I've used other Rosetta Stone language sets before, and I have become an enthusiastic advocate of the series ever since I first popped the discs into my computer.  This series does a very thorough, professional, and entertaining job of introducing concepts, pronunciation, and culture to the user which makes it fun and intuitive to learn.  One aspect that all users of of this series should think of is the considerable amount of money you will save by taking the Rosetta Stone courses over university-taught courses.  I fully endorse the university experience to everyone, but one part of my education that I didn't appreciate was the way my foreign languages were crow-barred into a tight window dictated by the school's curriculum.  I know that time is a factor in all classroom environments, but in my experience, foreign languages are best taught with more time and patience given to the student.  This set really promotes that idea, and manages to have a great deal of social interactivity as well.This program comes with games, live practice sessions, and practical exercises that were actually kind of fun to participate in. I am surprised at the level of immersion a strictly online application is able to achieve. Before I used this product, I felt a set like this would lack social interaction with other native speakers, and learning pronunciations, backgrounds, and some sort of framework as to why a word is pronounced the way it is. A frustrating aspect of any language course at a university is that you are sped (or slowed) along at whatever pace is dictated to your instructor, thus losing some continuity and flow of the learning process. When one is forced to learn a language in a certain time frame it can either cause a lot of stress for those who don't understand concepts, or bore those who feel like they have a good grasp of the material. This set is very useful because you can learn at your own pace, challenge yourself if you feel up to the task, and never get caught in an annoying time schedule. Taking public language courses can be corrupted by rules and regulations, and this set counteracts that notion. Of course, universities have their own versions of online tests and practices, but none are as colorful and vivid as the ones I've experienced in this set. Rosetta Stone has an online community of users that I checked in on several times, and it was filled each time with people waiting to practice and speak with others. The volume of interaction was huge compared to my university experience which is essential in learning a new language.A great deal of production and attention to detail was put into this Rosetta Stone set, and the level of immersion and exercises is not only high, but very enjoyable and interesting. It might be harder to understand how useful this is without ever having taken a university-taught course in language, but I'm now sold. Frankly, I was a little skeptical of how this would work, because learning a new language ultimately needs to be a social experience, and hearing and witnessing native speakers in action is essential in becoming a skilled speaker. However, this set does a fantastic job of capturing that social interaction, and even manages to be a little more exciting in interacting with others via the internet and phone.This is the second foreign language set I've used, and I'm having a good time learning Italian, at my own pace.  It's important that users make a push to learn and to not take too much time in immersing themselves in the concepts with a foreign language, but it's a huge plus to be able to allow oneself to fully grasp an idea before they move on.  Rosetta Stone allows that window to be more flexible, and ultimately clears the way for better and more effective learning.",5.0,Very impressed!,1299715200,"03 10, 2011",Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,1.0,,

I have these....and here are my findings.1.  They are awkward at first, as with any new skill you try when lifting weights.2.  Someone said he couldn't use his ""normal"" weight when doing incline press.....if you can do 90 lb incline press WITH DUMBBELLS then these hooks will NOT hamper your ability in doing incline presses with the same weight.  That doesn't even make sense.  However....if you never or rarely do certain exercises with dumbbells then yes, you will have to lower the weight...at first.  Anyone who lifts knows if you go from a bar to dumbbells then you will have to take time to get used to each arm lifting independently.3.  Yes....it will take a few times to get used to placing your bench just right under the bar that holds the hooks for you.  I do not bump the bar when using these.  And just like lifting on your own, without a spotter, with a barbell.....it's no different with dumbbells.  You need to be able to muscle them back up to hook the bar.4.  They are NOT made to be dropped!!!  They are made to hook on the bar when your set is done.  I read a review on here that complained that they get banged up or something when you drop the dumbbells.  Duh!  You wouldn't throw your barbell on the floor when you got done bench pressing, would you?  No....then why would you think you would throw these on the floor?  It doesn't make sense.  These hooks are designed to be placed BACK on the bar after your set...NOT thrown on the floor.5.  They are comfortable...to me.  Unless you don't find padded material comfortable, you will find them comfortable too.  Someone actually said that if you have big hands then you can't use these.  What?????  They fit ON THE HANDLE!  If your hands don't fit around a dumbbell handle then it's not the hooks fault.  They take up ZERO space on the handle, other than adding just a few centimeters in thickness around the handle.6.  In my opinion....they also help prevent shoulder injuries from trying to muscle up the dumbbells to their position.  There are a few videos on youtube demonstrating these hooks.  There is also one that shows how to use chains hanging from a power cage or from rafters in your basement hooked on to these as a spotting system in case you can't muscle them back up to rehang them back on the bar.  I have the chains hanging from the top of my power cage and attached to the hooks so I can go to exhaustion on my last set without the worry of dropping the weights on the floor.",5.0,I've had these for about a year.,1385769600,"11 30, 2013",Sports_and_Outdoors,1.0,,

With luck, I'll remember to update this review after a few months use.The satchel appears to be well stitched together of durable canvas.  Its handsome but rugged appearance seems right for the task.  There's no inherent stiffness or padding, but my use includes carrying a couple of clipboards which resolves that issue.I have a feeling this case will hold up well for a number of years.  It's already very comfortable to carry and to use.Some reviewers have lamented the non-adjustable shoulder strap.  Since I won't use the shoulder strap often, it's a non-issue.  An aftermarket adjustable strap could be snapped into place easily.Several reviewers have commented negatively on the red and white oval BucketBoss name tag.  The name tag's shiny plastic texture and its brilliant red and white colors are way wrong.  Anyone who routinely carries a combination tool and document briefcase is most likely not trying to make a fashion statement, but this name tag just doesn't belong.Well, no problem.  It's attached by a single row of stitching around the edge.  I grasped an edge with needle nose pliers and carefully cut a stitch with a razor knife.  Then I was able to pull it away with fingers and continue slicing the stitches.  Took less time than you've spent reading this.  Looks just right without it.  A cloth logo in the proper colors would have worked well here, but it's perfectly fine without any logo.The one significant problem with the satchel is one that I saw clearly from the photos on Amazon's site and others, so it was no surprise.  I purchased anyway, intending to either live with it or to kludge a workaround.  That problem is that the ""Business Side"" and the ""Tool Side"" are reversed.The ""Tool Side"" features two rows of narrow stitched pockets intended for small hand tools.  Nicely done, but these tools need to be quickly accesible, and preferably with the satchel standing upright.  The ""Tool Side"" therefore could be better utilized under the flap.The ""Business Side"" is used for stowing file folders and documents which might benefit from a slightly greater bit of security.  The ""Business Side"" then would have been better placed in the zippered section.  To some this may seem a quibble.  Depends on your particular work situation, I suppose.  For me the reversal would have been far better.Still, I bought it, and I like it.  I looked around quite a bit and could find nothing else that fit the bill as well.",4.0,"Now, better than new...",1346284800,"08 30, 2012",Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,1.0,,

Okay, if you are a novelist, of course, go to self publishing for greater production numbers.  But, if you are intimidated by the whole process of publishing your short story, poetry or artwork, this is a way to do it-low risk.  I think you can do up to 50 pages at a reasonable fee per page beyond the allowed amount. An older child may not get excited about the kit until you show them what they can do with on-line publishing. The company's website has some sample books you can view.I bought the Creations by You Illustory Kit for my son who was about 10 at the time.  He was more interested in cartoon drawing (which they now have a kit for which I bought), so I decided to use it myself to create a book of inspirational sayings for my Goddaughter.  I communicated by email and phone with a representative when I didn't know how to create what I wanted to do in their on-line format.  The representative was patient and easy to follow.The end result was a beautiful 50 page book with a painting on the cover, text in various fonts and colors, and, artwork or photos on each page (double-sided.) I was able to use as many words as I could fit in a Word document which I saved in PDF in order to be uploaded.  Photos can also be easily uploaded. You can also superimpose words over images or anything else you can do in a word document, before uploading to your book. The system allows you to move the pages around as often as you'd like and add and delete as needed. You do have to pay for additional pages and books, but the cost is reasonable.  I was working on a deadline, and, even though it was their busiest time of year, the company worked quickly on my order and I got the books in less than three weeks.  After a few months, I did have trouble with the binding on one of the books, but I sent it back and they repaired it satisfactorily. When you get your kit, read the instructions carefully, particularly if you want to publish on-line. I'd also recommend you buy an extra copy for a keepsake if your child will be using the book a lot. The books aren't indestructible. They do sell plastic covers for them, but I can't comment on the covers since I did not purchase them.Overall, these kits are awesome and the company is very customer friendly.  It is an American company who also has a publishing program for teachers and their students to help advance literacy.  I would recommend the kits for any age, especially when using on-line publishing.",5.0,"I would recommend this kit for ANYONE, ANY AGE",1382745600,"10 26, 2013",Toys_and_Games,1.0,,

Gerbino ""Longhaul trucker, Chihuahua...","[31, 32]","Let me get this straight... you want to carry a $450 gadget with a hard drive in it with you when you jog? No sir!I have been using the nearest product to a competitor for monthes... the Personal Jukebox 100 from Han-Go electronics, both the 4.68 and 6.4gig versions. The Creative Nomad JB is by far a better developed, more feature laden product. It has many, many improvements over the PJB-100 including the excellent software that allows you to cue up an unlimited number of MP3 tracks to transfer then go away while the USB chugs along. The PJB-100 makes you go in small bunches of tracks a directory at a  time then puts them in Alphabetical order no matter the album order. The only way to preserve order in the PJB-100 is to rip directly to the unit which leaves no MP3 on your computer, and is slower than a modern PC as well.By comparison the Nomad preserves album order by default and organizes automatically by Playlist, Album, Artist, and Genre. The PJB requires you to make playlists when transferring from the PC by making 'copies' of the tracks on the unit. These take up no space but you can't manipulate the playlists except when connected to the PC. The Nomad lets you do all this easily with the unit itself, a much better method.Battery life... The PJB-100 lasts 12 full hours of continuous use on a charge of its Lithium Ion battery. The Nomad claims 4 hours but this is dependant upon many other factors. Like how well behaved the Nickel Metal-Hydride batteries are. This is the kind that has a 'memory' and degrades rapidly if not completely exhausted, then completely charged. The normal use pattern of this sort of unit means this isn't going to happen. I feel that Creative's including a second set is more ominous than friendly. And they warn on several labels and stickers to use Only Creative NiMh batteries as replacements even though they are nominally the same as any other 1.2 volt, AA form rechargable except in that NimH and Nicads have different discharge curves. I do not choose to experiment with a widget this expensive. And at any rate the unit is best suited for staionary, home use where it can remain plugged in.The PJB-100 has a car kit. This is a BAD thing. In use one failed with a broken line out jack... it only has ONE! Even after getting warranty repairs the unit failled again only weeks later from HD death. This time out of warranty. The second unit started making model helicopter noises when the HD runs so it lives in semi retirement at home now. We will see how well the Nomad likes the highways but I suspect it will stand up to the vibration and bouncing a little better. It is a sturdier sort of creature to be sure.EAX effects... yawn. You can distort and twist your music in a wide variety of fashions. I use MP3 to AVOID this. What would be usefull is Not included. That is Normalization. Using WinAmp you can have you choice of free normalization plug-ins. MusicMatch Jukebox used to have a normalization option but it never worked right and is now absent from the current version. CD's do not have equal levels... much less Mp3's ripped from them. Anyone who has listened to a playlist from many different CD's can recall turning up the volume to hear a quiet track then being blasted into next week by the next track from a louder Cd. This is also what keeps Windows Media Player 7 and RealPlayer from being usefull MP3 players.Still... I like everything about the design of this thing except the shape. The PJB-100 is squarish. At least it has a flat surface on the bottom and fits in a large pocket. The Nomad is CD player shaped sorta. But there is no convenient way to HOLD it. The PJB-100 comes with a case that shows it's display and exposes it's controls. The Nomad case cannot be used while playing it. No hole for the jack or controls. Just a bag. And it is not going in anyone's pockets. Again... much more suited to live on the shelf hooked into the stereo. The PJB-100 comes with a mini-plug to RCA phono-plug 'Y' cable to connect to the stereo. Not so the Nomad though it DOES have 2 lineouts and surround capability. Very nice.There is currently no control to use with the IR port and no 12 volt car adapter though Creative say both are coming. ... As the market grows the prices go low. Enjoy!",5.0,Jog with it?

Many complicated button functions.  Be prepared to spend a whole day with the manual (which does not come with the watch) to figure out the multiple combinations that you will never remember.  It might have helped to label the buttons.  As is, the labels are invisible as they are molded into the plastic and so small you need a magnifying glass and good light to even read them.

I couldn't get the kickstand to work, but he doesn't need that anyway. The belt clip piece is a bit tough to put on, but he decided against using that as well. Bottom line, for a rugged man that cant stay clean for long, lol, it works well to protect the phone.

I ordered the size 4-6 based on other reviews that stated it ran small. I'm so glad I did. To put it into perspective, my son wears 2T in pants and 3T in tops. My biggest complaint is I can't get it on him and I am going to have to attempt to alter it a bit so he can wear it. It is a one-piece suit and has only a small opening on the back to put it on. This means the entire thing has to go on from the bottom up. I got his legs in and managed to pull it past his waist with a little wiggling, but when it came to getting his arms in the sleeves, forget it. I couldn't get his arms in at all because the opening is too small. I just hope I can get it on him later because he freaked out and won't let me near him with it. :( I love the costume. It's very cute and he's going to be adorable, but I'm disappointed that I have to attempt to make the opening bigger at risk of ruining the whole thing.Just wanted to update that I did manage to get it on him for Halloween by opening up the seam on the back by another couple of inches. It looked great. We had trouble with the hat, though. It fit him fine and tied under his chin, but when he talked, the movement pulled the Velcro off the one side. We opted to put on his Mickey ear hat from Disney instead. Overall, the costume did it's job.

I've played the A&A board games and thought this would be similar. Despite the major difference in playing style, I quite enjoyed the miniatures. This particular set was like a teaser, it got me interested in buying more. However, it's not a very balanced set. First off it comes with 4 tanks, 3 of which are allied tanks and 1 is axis. It comes with 6 infantry soldiers, three on each side. The allies have a commander so the M1 Garand troop gets bonuses and the allied side gets an initiative bonus. On the other side the Germans have an MG 42 unit with the double shot ability and a high kill ratio vs. infantry, so the infantry is balanced.  However, each allied tank could overpower the axis tank individually.  The axis tank is a Panzer III Ausf. F which has lower armor and a low cost.  All of the allied tanks are almost twice the Panzer's cost and have more armor/fire power. Out of all the scenarios I have run with this set the Germans have only won once due to a lucky roll by the axis Panzerfaust 30 unit taking out the American Sherman early on in the match.  Overall, the set is rather nice. It's a good way to add some troops and armor into your ranks. It's also a good way to obtain the rare British Cromwell tank and the uncommon Russian T-34/76 tank.

And one of the areas where many struggle is putting. Getting the grip, the aim, the stroke, and everything else just right takes time and effort and Club Champ is here to help with the task.With this Club Champ product, you get nine feet of putting area to practice and improve your skill. The carpet comes folded and it can take time to work out the creases, but once flattened you are ready to grab a golf ball, your favorite putter, and start practicing.Probably the best feature of this Club Champ product is the ball return. It works well and continuously sends the ball back to you. I like that I can stand in one place and putt the ball over and over again. This makes it nice not just for putting practice, but also for kids who can entertain themselves without much frustration.It&#8217;s cool to have a way to practice one&#8217;s putting, but there are problems with this product that lead me to lower my rating. The biggest issue I have is with the construction. It is made about as cheaply as possible, apparently for maximum profits. And yes, the design, with its sticker &#8220;traps&#8221; for sand and water and its background of trees is silly. But it&#8217;s the construction that bothers me the most.

I was not sure which I was going to be and also, I figured, it would not hurt to have an extra costume on hand in case another friend was out of ideas and needed something to wear.Well, I received both less than a few days apart.  At a small party with my closest friends, I tried on both and the overwhelming response was to wear this one.I can gratifyingly say IT WAS A VERY BIG HIT at all of the parties I attended that night.  I went to four different Halloween parties and had my picture taken at least 50 times as the night progressed.I wore it plain, as it does come with some funny headbands (NUN FOR YOU, NUN OF YOUR BUSINESS etc.).  I also enhanced it with a set of rosary beads and a cross I had gotten from my grandmother.The costume is very light, so it is excellent to wear over regular clothing.  This way, if you want to go to the party and put it on at the last minute you can do so with ease.That being said, the material is of sheer nylon (no, you cannot see through it) and the headdress is easy to take on and off.  It appears to be machine washable, but because I wore regular clothing underneath it the one night that I wore it, I simply hung it outside for a few hours to get all of the cigarette smoke (the parties I went to were at four bars in the same neighborhood (Itaewon, Seoul, South Korea) within walking distance of where I was staying) out of it.It looks very authentic and I would highly recommend purchasing it if you do not intent to wear it often.",5.0,A big hit!!!!,1323129600,"12 6, 2011",Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,1.0,,

E-Ink technology vs. LCD technology, Tablets vs. dedicated E-Book readers...it has been a very hard decision indeed.  I have been lucky enough to have unrestricted access to almost all the abundant choices that are out there, and I have to say that the nook color is the most impressive out of all them.  That being said, I feel that they have only started to scrape the surface of what is possible with this machine.The Nookcolor has a beautiful screen, and after having it only a few days but barely being able to put it down I have to say that the battery life for the Nookcolor (with it's impressive resolution) is impressive.  The color screen is impressive and nice to have, and with the new update that you can download from the Nook's website, it makes the browsing a lot easierA fair amount of people might complain that it's a heavy reader, which it is heavier than most, but for myself - I like the weight of it.  It's reassuring, like that of a new hardcover book, and my eyes have not grown tired over time from reading the screen.The prices for the books?  Well, honestly there really isn't too much that can be done from B&N;'s perspective I guess.  Sometimes they're disappointing for the mere fact that you can sit in the store and read, and then go look at the price of the physical book to discover that it's 3 or 4 dollars cheaper in trade form.  But if that's the case, then the option has presented itself to buy the physical book over the ebook.  (Yes, muting the point of having an ebook reader/tablet but the option is nonetheless present.)The reading for up to an hour is a nice touch on B&N;'s side.  I enjoy going to a bookstore and this gives me a perfect opportunity to go and sit down (of course trying to find a chair can be difficult but has nothing to do with this review) and peruse the online NookBook selection.  And if I grow tired of trying to find something on their exceptionally designed online store, I can simply walk around the store to find a new selection.I am thoroughly impressed with this eBook tablet, it's a near perfect blend of the technology out there, and as I stated before - I feel that Barnes and Noble will only continue to improve their new reader.

They tend to last about 2 years, and then something breaks or fails.  Fortunately, I'm mechanically inclined and have been able to fix or work around most problems.  So far, (1) the cover latch has broken.  For a while, we held the cover down while it was grinding, but I eventually disassembled the unit and bypassed the safety switches.  Now I just have to remember to have all the parts in place before pushing the start button!  (2) The heater element failed.  To repair this, I disassembled the unit and re-soldered a connection.  (3) The motor bearings froze up.  Probably this is because of all the moisture that circulates inside the machine every time it's used.  It was a pain to get the motor out to oil it.  That did fix the problem, but only for a few months, and we've been using pre-ground coffee since then.  (4) On our first unit (a white one), one of the pivot pins on the carafe lid broke off, which is a pain but can be lived with.

Here is a card game that uses cards, Dalek tokens and TARDIS tokens to defend or attack your lands for ownership.The colorful cards each have very a specific meaning and purpose. The defenders who are The Doctor, Amy, Rory, River Song and even Captain Jack fight for keeping land that you lay down as your property. What land? Imagine every place the Doctor has visited since his run as the 9th through the 11th Doctor (Christopher Eccleston, David Tennant, Matt Smith). Lake Silencio, Sardick Town, Silurian City, Bowie Base One, Roman Britain, Luna University and Zarathustra are some of the locations to name a few.Now the Enemies include the Daleks, Nestine Consciousness, Cybermen, Weeping Angels, Sycorax, Sontarans, The Silence, Davros, the Minotaur, the Beast, Gangers, The Master, Prisoner Zero, the Slitheen and more who all try to take your lands. Oh and watch out for the Dreamlord! He's really dangerous!Now add the element of support cards to help you fight, defend and in some cases give you special powers and abilities. They are labeled the TARDIS, Sonic Screwdriver, Fish Fingers and Custard and yes they do help immensely!Cards are dealt out. Then you figure out your lands. Then you place your defenders or attackers and the battle begins. The game is played in turns and what is unique is that you play your hand but you always must have three cards to pass to your player on your right. (Counter-clockwise) The turn continues going to the next person on your left. (Clockwise) In other words you are doing things in two directions. Sounds strange, but it makes for great stagey in playing.Once you achieved a land, you then place your colors TARDIS token on it. If you are attacking or taking over someone else's land that is not yours, you place your colors Dalek token on it. When the first player gets five TARDIS's or five DALEK's out on table in their color, the game is over and everything stops. However, your lands are worth victory points. Some are low and some are high. The victor is the one with highs points from the lands they have acquired.It can be vicious and turn on a dime. You could have four lands in one turn and zero the next. It changes with the player and the cards. It's extremely fun and you find yourself acting out scenes from the various enemies and locations you see in your hand. (If you are familiar with Who, of course.)Its fun for the whole family and you can sit and relax and bring on your `game face' when you are to defend the universe using the Doctor and his companions for help. But beware, enemies abound and trouble is always both in front of you and behind you!

I had never made my own ice cream before and I wanted to make 2010 the summer of ice cream.  The unit arrived early on my front door step.  I immediately read the instructions, put the freezing unit in my freezer to prepare it for my first concoction, then went to the health food store to stock up on organic products.For my first few attempts, I used recipes in the Cuisinart book that comes with the unit.  I started with chocolate -- an egg-free recipe. It turned out wonderful!  Perfect texture and good flavor.  Being a chocolate fan, I experimented with other chocolate variations and discovered that it's very easy to make ice cream with this unit.  I have since made about a dozen different ice creams and sorbets -- each time learning how to do it better the next time.I always chill my 'batter' for at least 2 hours before freezing it in the machine and I've never had a problem with soft ice cream.  I've made ice cream with and without eggs and I must say I haven't made up my mind which I prefer.  The eggs make a richer ice cream, but I prefer a lighter flavor.  I'm also still working out what type of sweetener I prefer.  Most recipes call for sugar (and lots of it).  Usually the recipes are too sweet for me so I've been using other sweeteners.  My favorite (so far) is agave nectar.  It is a honey-like syrup that is sweet without imparting a strong flavor (the way honey does).  It works very well with fruit sorbets.For the price, this ice cream maker brings a lot of fun into the home.  I have learned to make small batches of ice cream -- about half the capacity of the unit -- so I can experiment with many flavors and not be 'stuck' with too much of any one flavor.

If you manage to root this device (voiding your warranty) you still won't have bluetooth, GPS, a camera, HDMI, nor the ability to easily connect your Nook to your monitor, TV, printer, keyboard, or mouse. You will only have internet access when you're near wifi, no option of 3G service.If you're looking for an e-Reader, just buy a regular e-Reader. The reading experience on the Nook is NOT the same as classic e-Readers, which seem to have more of a paper appearance to their screens. Reading on the Nook is just okay and is best in sunlight. I'm not too thrilled about reading on this while in bed, for instance, as it's not as gentle on the eyes when compared to regular eReaders. If you're not used to reading on a regular eReader, this might not be a problem at all for you. If you like the eReader experience, these types of devices will disappoint. While you can change the background color and dim the screen, it is a far inferior reading experience.I, personally, purchased this device believing there would be some setting that would make the reading experience like one on a regular eReader. While the Nook has a lovely screen and beautiful Netflix playback, it's not a good eReader unless you're reading a lot outdoors.I bought this knowing that the app selection was poor, but not realizing just how poor it really is. B&N; seriously needs to open up this device for more learning apps. After my initial disappointment, I just figured I would let my children have my Nook. It *seems* to be great for kids as they can use the various learning tools, and they're more likely to reread books than I am. But, when it came to looking for various math, spelling, and other learning material for my 7 and 10 year old sons, the selection was dismal at best!It's cool to play Angry Birds on a larger screen to the tune of 3 bucks per version... and Drawdle is a huge hit with my boys, but the excitement sort of ends there. The excitement really ended after I paid 2 bucks for a spelling app that isn't even compatible with my device. The way the market is locked down, that shouldn't even be possible! As for Netflix, well... how many places will I have wifi and the time and ability to watch a movie also? At home I can just watch Netflix on the big screen TV. It would be most useful for long car rides if you have mobile hotspot on your phone. But, of course, streaming from your mobile hotspot will just eat up your monthly usage!All in all, I say it's a very confused device. If you're looking to buy this, save yourself the money and just buy the Nook Color for $169. The tablet is a little faster and a little lighter in weight, but $250 sort of exceeds this device's usefulness. I was also planning to read library books on my Nook... only to learn that I don't have access to the Overdrive app in order to do so. If there is some roundabout way to accomplish this, I just haven't put in the time to investigate.I honestly think this device is best suited for kids just because big touch screens are fun. In the end it's an over-sized android phone without the market... or the phone lol. It's a cool toy for a kid (maybe 8-18 years of age) to have for the family on a budget, I guess. But to me, it's starting to feel like a waste of money. I'm not too keen on the reading experience, and while both of my kids are just dying to get time on the Nook, the learning app selection is *severely* limited. However, as my kids aren't as picky as I am, they would actually get some use out of this device as an eReader. Yet, since this doesn't seem to be a device designed for kids, I do wonder how long it will take them to break it. =-p",3.0,What are you looking for???,1332201600,"03 20, 2012",Electronics,0.0,,

They sing about how America is dumb, but also how the average American knows this and just ignores it, like in the part where they repeat: ""One more pill to keep me safe/ One more prayer to keep us warm."" They also make a point of saying that with guns, it is too easy to kill someone, thus making the shooter forget that he is actually commiting murder and killing another person. But, all these messages are told very creativley, not making it sounding like social commentary, though that's what it really is, and most listeners probobly won't even pick up these messages the first few times they listen to the cd.

The learning curve is quick enough to be fun & complex enough to keep you busy for a while.  Freezing dulls the taste buds, so your base - whatever it is - should taste just a little too sweet, a little too strong (this is one of the reasons why melted ice cream is kinda... gross).  This also makes it important to concentrate flavors, which can be a challenge.Here's a recipe template:  SLOWLY reduce 2 cups of wine by half - I use a slow cooker with the lid off - it takes hours, but you don't have to do anything. If you want, infuse the wine with herbs, spices, citrus peel, small frogs, whatever, during this time (it may take more than you think to have the right presence).  Strain if necessary.  Stir in 2/3 - 1 cup sugar, till dissolved.  Add this syrup to 2-3 cups fruit juice or puree.  Add something for a little tartness, if necessary, a couple of teaspoons vodka or other appropriate liquor (or perhaps a couple tablespoons of raw wine), chill the base well & proceed.I second all the advice about having everything cold & working quickly once the cannister comes out of the freezer.  I took & extended a couple of tips in the reviews:  I store the cannister in the freezer with 3 freezer-gel packs inside it, & I cover the top hole of the machine with a freezer-gel pack wrapped in a dish towel while the machine's working.Have fun.",5.0,Ridiculously good stuff,1258934400,"11 23, 2009",Home_and_Kitchen,1.0,,

It has several pockets: making it easy to segregate cash, ID's and charge cards.  It has stood up to the rigors of travel very well - does not seem to stain (with sweat, for instance) easily, and looks as good as new, with no discernible wear.My concerns with the product are as follows:1) The neck cord is incredibly long.  It has an adjuster, but there is an awful lot of &#34;slack&#34; which hangs down my back.  I suppose I could cut the cord to make it shorter, perhaps knotting the ends, but doing so might increase the risk of losing the Stash, so I've not done so.  This is, at most, a minor inconvenience - and it makes sense for the manufacturer to make the cord long, &#34;just in case.&#34;  So, this has not affected my rating of the product.2) My other concern, and this is one that would be true of any such product, is that you cannot wear it under lighter weight fabrics without it showing, which to some extent defeats the purpose of it.

The result is ice cream that puts to shame what you can find in these stores. Using high quality ingredients isn't cheap -- but for me ice cream is a special occasion treat that I want to savour with family and friends.Using the Cuisinart has been simple. Two elements are critical: Making sure the bowl is fully frozen -- just keep it in the freezer -- and that the liquid you put in has had time to drop to as low as possible without freezing. I keep the bowl inside a large zip lock bag in our chest freezer - the bag keeps it from absorbing off-flavors. As for cooling the liquid, many need to be heated to absorb sugar or chocolate so it's best to prepare it no later than the night before, or better yet, 24 hours in advance.When the bowl and liquid are properly prepared it takes about 25 minutes to make ice cream. At that point you have two options. For a soft serve texture it can be served right away or soon after it's placed in the freezer; for a hard ice cream, two hours in the freezer is usually sufficient.We find the 1 1/2 quart size to be sufficient for our family of four and the quantity can be enough to serve double that if ice cream is an element to a dessert -- I like serving a smaller scoop of cinnamon ice cream (using just-ground cinnamon sticks) with any sort of baked apple/pie/tarte tat in.  If you are looking to make more than one flavor having a second bowl is handy.The reliability has been excellent so far after 3 years of use. The noise level is perfectly reasonable to me -- far less grating than a blender and the whirr of the motor is also a clue to when it's ready -- it slows a bit as the ice cream reached the end stage of thickening.",5.0,Premium ice cream that blows away store-bought,1341360000,"07 4, 2012",Home_and_Kitchen,1.0,,

(same as eInk Nook)You can borrow ebooks from libraries.  (same as eInk Nook)You can read a book for an hour each day at any B&N; store.  (same as eInk Nook)ebook Cons:short battery life, 6-10 hours?The touch screen. Don't touch it while reading or  1. a menu pops up for things like brightness settings, text size, highlighting, dictionary, share options, find button, content button & a slider to zip to a page quickly or;  2. the page might turn, or  3. the page will scroll vertically or horizontally.  You MUST hold the device by the margins outside the glass.  Great if you hold by the edges when you read a real book--all others, take notice, as my hands did tire of holding a book this way.You wish, after having seen how you upsize or downsize pages on the iPad (Pinch/spread 2 fingers on the glass) that you could do the same here.On the one I bought I saw some very irregular activity related to the menu flashing on and off without my having touched the screen & also the virtual keyboard would occasionally act up, e.g.,  a single key press of 'n' might give me 'nnn' or 'nmm' or even 'niin'The virtual keyboard requires you to press a '123' button to get numbers.web browser pros:great color and resolutionOn almost any monitor you'll have to scroll up/down to read long text passages.  The NC seemed to know how to center and wordwrap the text on most webpages in the display so as not require you to scroll left/right.Virtual keyboard has a "".com"" button for entering web addressesweb browser cons:It doesn't enlarge pages by the iPad/SamsungGalaxy pinch/spread technique.  You first must slide a finger on the screen to bring up a +/- buttons in a corner and then touch +.Same issue with my big long thumbs on the glass.

When I took it in to B&N;, it played innocent and behaved well. Later, at home again it went nutty.Final verdict.  Not for me.  Perhaps a later version with better battery life, maybe color eInk, a version of the browser that supports Adobe Flash, a more behaved virtual keyboard with number keys above the letter keys.

After reading all of the bad reviews on this one, I still really liked the design so I figured I'd go ahead and order it, and also order another rubberized snap-on case, different design. When I got the cases, they were both beautiful, especially this one. The design looks exactly like in the picture and it wasn't broken like a lot of people are saying. It was in perfect condition and also fits the phone perfectly. But the case is not rubberized (neither one of them). In fact, there's barely much plastic to it at all....one drop and this case would be history. Would it protect the phone? Maybe. But no rubber at all...I was hoping to get a plastic case with a rubber coating, to provide some type of shock resistance in the event of a drop. But no can do. The title also says something about a faceplate? I don't know what that means but there was no ""faceplate"", just a case. But hey you get what you pay for.

There really isn't that much offered out right now. Went ahead and tried this case now because it was cheap and the skull design was kind of cool. Shipping was quick and I received it in less then a week. I'm a little disappointed in the quality of the product. First off this one came with a pouch cover. Just a felt pouch, really cheap. It had drawstrings that broke the second I tried to pull on them. The bag was a waste of time and I don't even use it. Might be good for me to keep wee.. umm I mean other things in but not my cell phone. The case itself had a rubber like coating on the outside, it felt OK and offered a better grip over the feel of the normal phone. It didn't add to much bulk to the phone. The things I didn't like is that though the outside of the case was coated in a black the inside of the case was gray and not coated at all, when the phone is placed into the case you can definitely see the gray borders which makes the phone look cheap. The case slides onto the phone so it's not as secure as I would like. The build quality of the case make it so it doesn't aligned perfectly with the front and back bezels. The bezels have a bit of extra edge to them, this hinders the sliding mechanism of the Epic. All the correct cut outs for the phone are present, so that part is good.

But it doesn't live up to the expectations. Mainly because of a number of software implementations (or lack thereof), which might be overcome in the next releases of the Nomad Player software and the bundled PC software Package 'Playcenter'. For now, the Nomad Jukebox package doesn't cut it for me, and as such, I have returned, for the first time in my e-shopping life, a product because it didn't met my expectations...A large array of magazine advertisements and articles would let you to believe that the Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox is the best of the best of MP3 players. Well, because you can read all about the good stuff about this player in other places, let me focus on the 'features' that ruined my experience with this device.Missing from the package: the line-in cable to record music onto the Nomad player. When I buy a 400+ dollar device, I don't want to have to run to the store to buy a cable to hook the Nomad to my tape deck - especially not because the recording capabilities are one of the advertised features. And, by the way, the cables to connect the Nomad Jukebox to your speakers (or amplifier) are also not included.Unable to record MP3 format. Yes, the Nomad Jukebox can record through it's line-in jack, but only in the bulky WAV format. You then have to upload the file to the PC, convert WAV to MP3 format, and redownload. Ugly. Probably caused by the fact that there is not enough cpu horsepower in the Nomad to encode in MP3 format. This limits the amount of music that you can record on the Nomad Jukebox, as a WAV file is 20x larger than the same MP3 file.No battery life information. There is no way to see the charge-status of the batteries in the Nomad Jukebox. So you don't know if your batteries are fully charged while you are connected to an AC outlet, and you don't know how much longer you will be able to listen to the music while playing on batteries. Ugly - I thought every battery powered device offered a battery status indicator.Ugly filing mechanism. When files are copied from the PC to the Nomad Jukebox player, the filename (and directory structure) on the PC is lost. So if you organized your MP3 files on your PC by means of directories and filenames, you will find this a very unpleasant surprise. While downloading songs, the Nomad Jukebox makes its own filename for each MP3 file, based on the information in the ID3 fields of the MP3 file. And let me tell you: most MP3 files you will have do not have this TAG properly filled out, so make sure you have a few extra days to correct all this on your PC before downloading your music to the Nomad Jukebox. Getting all the ID3 tags of all your MP3 files right is mandatory if you want to use the Nomad Jukebox, a long and tedious job.Download issues Because of the 'Ugly Nomad Jukebox Filing Mechanism' as described above, downloading your music collection from your PC to the Nomad Jukebox is likely to fail. This download stops whenever 2 files with the same 'new derived filename' are detected. And given the fact that all your PC directory and filename information is trashed, and the filenames are deducted from the embedded ID3 information, this is very likely to happen a few times to you.Unable to search for songs. On the MP3 player, you can not search for a song (with the name), or for any keyword (i.e. word in the title of a song). The only searches that are supported are artist searches. Euh ? Did somebody fail to implement all other software routines ? This is very user un-friendly.Unable to navigate within a single track: you can't fast-forward within the same track - real annoying if you are listening to a one-hour radio show or another lengthy piece of music - you always need to (re)start from the beginning of the song.No way to update song information on the Nomad Player. OK, here is the deal: you are listening to your music while traveling, and you notice that the song-information is not accurate. You want to correct the name of the artist, the song, the album, the genre, or anything about the song. Impossible. You need to note it down on a piece of paper, change it on the MP3 song on your PC, and redownload the song to the Nomad. Very user un-friendly. In essence, this also means there is no syncing of any information between the Nomad and the PC - you can only download (wav, mp3) and upload (wav only) between the PC and the Nomad Jukebox, there is really no syncing like with a Palm-pilot to ensure that information is updated once you change it on the PC or the player.Uploading MP3's doesn't work. Surely a software issue, implemented to restrict digital copying ? Frankly, I don't care. When I go down to my friends with my MP3 player, I want them to be able to read/copy what I have on the hard-disc. And I want to be able to hook my player to their PC, download songs, and later on (if I like them) upload them to my PC for backup purposes. I can do this with all removable media MP3 devices, why can't I do this with the Creative Nomad Jukebox ?Hey, perhaps some of these features are available on the Nomad Jukebox, and I just didn't find it. That's definitely possible. The printed documentation included in the package and the software demo included on the CD-Rom are definitely not complete...",1.0,Great idea and concept - but software just doesn't cut it,975715200,"12 2, 2000",Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,0.0,,

Unfortunately, it was designed to be looked at, not played with.  Right on the back of the package it clearly states DO NOT move Rex's head or his arms or you might damage the product.  That's right, you're not supposed to play with this toy.  The legs barely move at all (maybe a 1/2 inch).  So you can't make it walk like Rex does in the movie.  My daughter is a huge Toy Story fan.  We bought her the Toy Story Collection: Buzz Lightyear and she plays with it non-stop.  But with Rex, she can't do anything with it but sit it on the table and listen to it talk.  On top of that, the tail unscrews very easily.  You unscrew the tail to replaces the batteries.  But the slightest twist of the tail by a child whom might pick it up by the tail or, *gasp*, swing it by the tail will cause the tail to come right off.The first thing my daughter did when she got this toy was try to turn the head and move the arms.  But when she did, you hearing this ""clicking"" sound indicating that the head/arms aren't meant to be turned by themselves.  So, yes, the box is right.The toy lasted all of 72 hours before we decided to return it to the Disney Store where we bought it.  It didn't break.  It just wasn't fun since my daughter couldn't actually play with her new toy.  We ended up buying a Rex plush doll (the only other Rex toy they had) and she's had tons more fun with it that she did with this $60 collectible.In summary, if you're looking for a collectible to sit on a shelf and admire, this Rex is perfect for you.  It looks just like Rex, and the toy is programmed with the original actor's voice from the movie.  But if you're looking for a toy that you or your child can actually play with, do not buy this.  When there's a warning on the back of the box telling you not to move it's head & arms or you risk breaking the toy, well, that pretty much tells you it's not meant to be played with.",3.0,"Not a toy, a collectible",1268956800,"03 19, 2010",Toys_and_Games,,"{'CS': 0.670624965, 'MNR': 0.0, 'RB': 0.0, 'RC': 3.0, 'PR': 66.66666667, 'NR': 33.33333333, 'FR': 0.0, 'RSP': 0.0, 'AW': 957.0, 'RD': 1.666666667, 'RL': 1989.0, 'ER': 0.0, 'PC': 1.348747592}",0.0

It is not very durable.  It isn't even glass.  It's made out of VERY easily scratched plastic.  I own several watches, and even the plain glass face models scratch at the drop of a hat, but this one takes it to a whole new level.  I'd be worried to sneeze too close for fear it may implode.#2 is the fact that despite the promises of being water resistent to 100 Meters (ie 300 feet) this watch isn't...FAR from it.  You are in danger of ruining this watch if you even enter a bathroom while someone ELSE is taking a hot shower.  The humidity alone may cause problems.  Pretty sad when a watch advertised as at the very least capable in a pool cannot honestly pull off a basic shower in a bathtub.Now, with that said, if you take care to avoid moisture whenever you can, the Vector is a fine wrist computer that works quite well in a variety of areas.  It'll tell you the temperature (under the right circumstances, of course), help you predict the weather, give you a bearing on where you need to go and then (after proper adjusting) tell you your altitude.  I found the altimeter to actually be rather accurate -- oh, and those reviews I have read on-and-off by folks bragging about telling the altitude INSIDE of a pressurized passenger plane are BOGUS.Considering what this watch can do, and it's limitations, I believe that the price is a bit high (you can buy a Casio watch that'll do the same thing--and is solar-powered, AND is REALLY water-resistent, all for LESS) but the Vector has one thing that not all Suunto watches, or altimeter/barometer/compass watches come with: that little bubble on the face which allows a more accurate determination of specific readings.  If Casio add's one to their model, I'll probably become a full-time convert.  If you are looking for something similar, but smaller, try looking at the Suunto Observer.  It's a dang-good-looking watch, but the price is considerably more, so that may be a rather important factor for you (I know it is for me).All in all, Suunto makes great products, but water resistent models are unfortunately NOT one of them (unless you are going for one of their products that actually are designed for underwater use).",4.0,"Great watch that, despite promises, is NOT waterproof to 100m.",1175558400,"04 3, 2007",Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,1.0,,

Unfortunately I got my first watch at another site, and paid nearly twice as much for it, a very similar style!  Live and learn; ALWAYS check Amazon first, before buying almost anything.  This watch is a bit bigger than the first one I bought, very similar in style, and a completely different color (first was black and rose tone, with crystals).  While I like this very much, I wish it were just a little smaller.  It is not huge, by any means, but I prefer a slightly daintier watch.  This is for casual wear, and very nice indeed for that purpose.  Being slightly larger (again, not truly big), it actually is rather stylish along the lines of a boy-friend watch.  It is not as large as a B-F watch, which is terrific, just larger than I normally would wear.  Eventually those will go out of style and will become very dated.  This is a classic style which I believe will look good for a very long time.  I like the mesh band on this one (and on my first one).  The only issue I have is that it is very difficult for me to close the clasp.  I had a similar problem with my first one, but I either got used to how to do it, or is just got ""broken in"" a bit with use.  I do find that this watch, being larger in all aspects, includig the mesh band, is less flexible.  It really is hard to get it closed.  I am hoping that in time I will get used to it, or that it will find its way more easily.  Other than that, it just about a perfect watch at a very good price.  As I considers watches to be jewelry, not merely timepieces, I am already looking at other Skagen watches.  However, I don't want to have a bunch that look too similar.  I am tempted, though, particularly by their ceramic watch, which is considerably different that those with mesh bands.  All in all I highly recommend this particular watch, as well as other Skagen watches.  How do they, I wonder, make such a classy, classic, refined and great looking watch for such a good price.  It is not like the cheapies, such as R#1!(, etc., and other such knock offs of watches in the low hundreds, nor what you would find at Walmart and other such stores, but the prices are nearly as good.

I buy a lot of books, and many kitchen items and gadgets, most using the 4-for-3 promotion, so even more savings.

Having been able to attend one of his concerts, I can vouch for his deep love of music and his ability to communicate this love to his audience. He was a spontaneous performer in command of what he played, and not afraid to tackle difficult works in his old age.This recital is quintessential Cherkassy. Perhaps a highlight is the Grand Sonata by Tchaikovsky, a piece not often performed and played to perfection here by Mr. Cherkassy. The variety of this concert is perfect.

I just wanted to say that I've compared the BMP bands with other resistance band products I've used and these bands are definitely more superior in both quality and strength.I also train with them myself, and enjoy the interchangeability of the bands, (it's more convenient for my clients when doing circuit training). I'm not really nervous that some part of the band is going to break if I'm hard on them, mainly because I've gone through literally hundreds of resistance bands over the years and BMP bands are by far the most durable I've had the chance to work with.I know their only rubber and rubber doesn't last forever, it just like anything else has a resistance threshold especially being used as much as I use them, but for the price their fantastic. I recommend these bands to all of my clients for traveling purposes and every day workouts.I feel that the design overall is tremendously better and being able to stack the bands on one handle creates a great workout not only for me, but my clients as well, A BIG PLUS. I also like the extras that are included in the package like the ankle strap and door anker, you don't get those with a lot of other packages and if you do, you have to pay more in order to get them most of the time.I even called BMP to drill down on their product even more because I believe in getting what I pay for and the customer service was impeccable. They answered all my questions, they were very personable and were extremely helpful. That's what impressed me the most, hence why I'm writing this.All-in-All, I'm really happy with my purchase and would recommend BMP bands to others and would also recommend them if you're planning on using bands for high intensity workouts such as the P90X program, aerobics classes and other circuit training exercises like I perform with my clients.

But many of the poor reviews complain about the results (mainly that the ice cream isn't firming up), and I wonder if those complaints are a result of the machine or the user.I make gelato in mine, and it comes out appropriately firm after about 30 minutes in the machine (even so, I usually transfer it to a storage container and pop it into the freezer afterward... then it's really firm).  However, I take my time with the gelato, and chill the mixture for several hours (usually overnight) before I put it in the machine.  This ensures that the mix is already very cold BEFORE it goes into the machine.  I wonder if folks are having trouble because their machine's bowl isn't cold enough?  The instructions say that the cold bowl should not slosh when shaken (without the ice cream mix in it!!!), and I had no trouble getting my bowl to freeze 'sloshless'.  In fact, I had to wait for it to thaw a bit so I could dry it out after I'd washed it; it was still so cold after churning that the kitchen towel I was using to dry it froze to the inside! Put the bowl in a freezer storage bag in the coldest part of your freezer (that's where I store mine), and it should be good to go when you're ready for it.My only complaints are that I almost wish that it was larger, as I sometimes would like the increased capacity, but it's already a fairly bulky gizmo as it is; and it would be nice if it was a bit quieter, though I've seen other ice cream machines that are MUCH louder, and you only run it for a half hour or so, anyway.",5.0,"A Great, Inexpensive Ice Cream Machine!",1252800000,"09 13, 2009",Home_and_Kitchen,1.0,,

I bought my nook color in an attempt to make part of my extensive library portable when I was riding the bus and I fell in love with it. The responsive, bright screen, the endless customization, the ability to have some android apps to help when I just cant read anymore all quickly helped make my nook one of my favorite electronics. One charge seems to last forever even with heavy usage.  I've kept it in a purple cover I got from B&N and after approx. a year, the nook looks brand new. (Although I would stay away from their purple fabric cover, beautiful but gets dirty SO easily) I absolutely love  my nook color. There are a few minor glitches, it has a tendency to be a little unresponsive if you have too much on it and the web browser isn't so great. The only major problem I've had with it is the fact that the ability to hi-light is unpredictable and difficult. That is why I'm selling mine to upgrade to an Ipad. I recently started taking courses and need something I can underline/hi-light/take notes on, and while the Nook Color is an EXTRAORDINARY e-reader, it was not created for either of those purposes.

I jail broke it, install a mostly vanilla image of Froyo and installed Adobe Acrobat and from there it shined. Page turning and navigation was a breeze and it complimented (read not-replaced) the Kindle DX quite well.It's a tad small for anything more in-depth than book reading and Angry Birds. Even casual web browsing can be a pain and it's place as a bastard hybrid of a phone OS on a 7"" tablet form factor means it has the worst of both worlds. Maybe once (if?) Android tablets take off we'll see mobile pages more suited to them. The huge up side is that it fits perfectly in a large coat pocket and looks sleek enough to make you look cool removing it from the pocket of an aviator jacket.In the end it spends most of its time sitting on a shelf collecting dust. It'll probably end up a gift for someone who doesn't mind lower-end electronics. These days while the Kindle Fire looks good I'm waiting on the market to mature and Windows 8 tablets to ship before I go looking again.",3.0,It's passable once jail broken,1321142400,"11 13, 2011",Electronics,0.0,,

Hansen ""Coffee Monkey's Father""","[3, 3]","This works well, but there are a few points to make it a success.-First, make sure your freezer is cold. A lot of freezers are too warm. -10 to zero F is ideal. Recommended food storage is halved for every 5 degrees above zero F. At -10 you are golden for this unit.-Second, make sure you freeze the bowl for a long time. 24 hours should be enough.-Third, make sure your ingredients are cold. Even if they are cool, it should be ok, but will be softer.Custard based recipes work great. Regarding taste... I'm amazed how many people have become so accustomed to artificial flavors and conditioners, that ""real"" doesn't taste right anymore. I find pure cream based recipes can leave a bit of a film on the roof of the mouth regardless of the tool used, but cutting with 25% half-and-half or whole milk is a good ratio. Nothing beats a good custard based ice cream on a hot day, four or five ingredients: Cream, sugar, eggs, flavorings, home run.Some things I don't like about it:Gel based freezers work, but they warm up from the second you take them out of the freezer. The old style salt and ice can maintain temps well, and the expensive integrated freezer units are about perfect, but obviously cost more. You need know know that going in. Gel isn't magic, but it works. You can't fault it for being something it's not though.The dasher doesn't scrape the side of the bowl, it sits off just slightly. This leaves a ring of frozen icy cream, not a smooth ice cream stuck to the side. I think the newer version has a better dasher/scraper.I might try running it in the freezer on an extension cord... why not.No way I would pay full retail for this, but at the current price point, it's a good deal.Also consider buying a treadmill or running shoes.",4.0,Works well,1340150400,"06 20, 2012",Home_and_Kitchen,1.0,,

Dye ""700hpAMG""","[10, 18]","Having all the iPad models, 9 different Android models, I can say this tablet overall is a bit disappointing. I realize for those that have come from old hardware or new to tablets might believe this is a bit harsh, but keep in mind this is more of a comparison to other options available out there. Granted there are price differences and for price alone, this is a decent deal.The hardware itself is impressive. Bought these for our 4 and 6 years which were upgrading from their Galaxy 2 7"" tablets. The most significant issue with these tablets is the B&N; version of an already outdated Android OS_Ice Cream Sandwich, not the latest Jelly Bean which is far far better. It is very clunky and very slow, not at all snappy by any sense, even with the latest updates. I did buy it as they finally put Play on it which was a requirement for me, but the OS itself is just horrible. It does have a kids profile mods which is very handy as it allows you to limit what your kids can open.Additionally, as this is an 'overlay' OS, it is very limited in terms of options. Sound options are none existent for various task such as switching profiles, etc. Many apps on the Google store will indicate not compatible with this device. I generally ROM my Android devices however CM10 is the only one at this time with any support and that ROM is very very buggy compared to say Frosty ROM which is not available for this tablet. It works, but again, not a smooth integration of a ROM. So really, your stuck with what B&N; puts on it and at this time, it is very slow and clunky. Now you can 'BUY' a card with Jelly Bean on it, but again, pulling off the card is slower vs. internal memory, though it does allow for a very simple method of getting a 'real' Android OS on this tablet and perhaps the best route at this time.For the kids, they still like the tablet, enjoy the better graphics, larger screen, etc. Once going graphics is good, sound is adequate though not great, touch input is good. But for me, I could never use this tablet for serious use. My Asus TF700T is my go to tablet, even over my iPad 4,3,2,etc. At this time I am contemplating just selling these and buy Nexus tablets for the kids instead as it is more a pure Android experience and not hindered by the clunky implementation of an older Android OS. Perhaps if B&N; releases an OS based on Jelly Bean it may improve things.Bottom line, there are far better options in the Android world.PROSGood resolutionTouch is goodGreat balance of size, not large nor small like a 7"" tabletHas Play installedExternal memory card optionCONSB&N; OS is horrible, slow, cluncky, and based on old Ice Cream Sandwich, not Jelly BeanSpeakers are just OKVery limited accessory options compared to even Kindle HD devicesCharger plug is very tight on both of my models.

This unit is really more like a toy.  Very light and cheaply built.  It feels like one of those Chinese things in a discount store or for $19.99 on TV which are always disappointing.  I don't understand other reviewers calling this a ""workhorse"".It cannot do the simplest of tasks well.  Take chopping onions.  Take one small onion, cut into two sections and put into the processor.  It will chop without stalling but the blade and container are not designed well enough to keep the food moving until it's all consistently chopped or puree'ed.  Some sticks to the top of the container and won't get chopped any further.  Some just stays out of reach of the blade and does not get chopped any further.  It leaves large chunks of food intact while the rest is turning into puree.  I find to chop one onion evenly I have to take the lid off and push the food back to the blade maybe 4-6 times, or more.  What a total PITA.  This should be a one-step 3-second procedure.  Helps if you add oil or liquid of course, but you shouldn't have to.  I can do it with my good knife better and faster.  Which should be a lesson.This seems inevitable for all the major brands.  They can't help themselves from covering all market segments and price points.  Even if they do it poorly.  They feel they are immune from mistakes and that poor-quality products won't hurt them in the long run.  I'm sure this units costs them about 3 or 4 dollars to produce in China.  They wholesale it for $15 and are making good money on it.  By the time it's marked up to retail at almost $30, it's a joke.Don't waste your money.  If you are used to the quality of a real Cuisinart food processor or are a serious amateur or pro, you'll be disappointed.  There is another model with larger and reversible blade which may be a better product.  Who knows.

Why then did I give it five stars? Because I figured out what I was doing wrong, and I fixed it. I could have written a review that described the results as ""just makes milk shakes"" or ""all I got was soup"" because that's what my first batch was. I left the canister in my freezer for 24 hours and thought that it MUST be frozen enough, but no, obviously it wasn't. It seems to me that there is a ""break in"" period on the canister, although I can't prove that. Here is the main reason that I was having an issue - how cold my freezer was. I turned it all the way down, it helped but there was another issue, I checked under the fridge and discovered that the coils had most likely never been cleaned since the fridge was installed, in the apartment I moved into. I went down to the local sewing machine/vacuum supply house and got an attachment that fits under there. I cleaned them thoroughly and the temperature went down so that the next batch of ice cream was much much better - it was actual ice cream :0)  So, after reading a lot of these reviews I gathered more information which helped. For example, the end result of the ice cream works far better if you whip the cream to a semi thick consistency, in an ice cold metal electric mixer bowl, then add the beaten egg yolks and sugar with the icy milk ensuring it is chilled before you put it in the canister to make ice cream. Be careful with the type of vanilla you add, if you add artificial, it contains an ingredient that impedes freezing. Our second batch was rum raisin which contains actual rum. Alcohol will also impede the freezing process, so it wasn't quite as firm as we would have liked, however it was an improvement upon the first batch. It firmed up fine in the freezer however.Now we come to the ""cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me"" as it were. We just made a batch of ""Cherry Garcia"" from the Ben and Jerrys book. WOW! Came out just like all the rest of the positive reviews that you see here.So to sum up, don't go by the reviews you see written by people that tried it once and gave up because they refused to accept that THEY were doing something wrong. Really read what people are telling you on here. Don't assume that just because your food in your freezer is frozen then it is cold enough. I put those cold gel packs that you use in coolers in the freezer at the same time as the canister and they froze in a much shorter time. I put the frozen gel pack on top of the plastic cannister (on top of the feed chute) and drape a tea towel over it to further help the freezing process. There are all SORTS of little tricks and tips that are located in the reviews here. Don't be afraid to experiment and improvise.So now I'm really hooked on this method of making ice cream. It gave me an excuse to purchase a chest freezer so I can put my 2nd container that is coming. I've been meaning to get one for years so I can buy the specials at the grocery store in bulk.This is the best ice cream you'll ever taste as long as you don't skimp on the quality of the ingredients.

So I finally took the leap. Flash forward to the arrival of my cute little red Cuisinart machine, and my first very own batch of homemade ice cream, prepared with a thoroughly chilled custard--an essential, I'd read, for ideal texture, and a technique that had proved its worth in my trial run. I chose a lovely recipe for malted milk chocolate ice cream from Lory Brody'sChocolate American Style, including the optional chopped malted milk balls.

I tried another program and in one lesson I feel as if I learned more about the Japanese language (sentence structure and some basic sentences and words) than with months (bought it 2 years ago really) of RS.I do not agree that we need verb conjugation and grammar.  No one really learns that way.  If we did, damn near everyone in the US would be bilingual because of HS language. After 4 years of Spanish or French who really leaves school knowing how to speak a 2nd language?  Plus, I'm watching my 3 year old niece pick up Spanish like she's drinking water.  She conjugates her verbs in both languages correctly over 90% of the time.  So obviously immersion works.  It's just a matter of finding what works best for you.",3.0,My Japanese vocabulary is great!!,1340323200,"06 22, 2012",Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,0.0,,

After having the Nook now for a month, I would have to say I absolutely love it! In one month, I have read seven books on my Nook eReader- all downloaded from my local library's online electronic database.  Today I just got the software update version 1.3 downloaded onto my Nook.  Version 1.3 is very different with the new menu options in the LCD touchscreen.  Some of the new software upgrades seem unnecessary for the use of the ereader, however as an educated consumer in the ereader industry, I understand B&N's logic for their recent upgrade capabilities with the competition of the Apple Ipad.  The Nook now offers a one click access to wifi, audio player, beta web application, games and  the ability to read ebooks for free in the store.  The latest upgrade also enabled a faster page turn, which was a common consumer complaint of the late version 1.2 software.  I had become quite accustomed to the previous page turn speed and now find myself flipping back to the previous page because I have hit the button too fast and missed the last few words in the sentence.  I did play with the game application and really enjoyed the chess game.  I found it fast to play and would serve as a good pass time in the future.  I didn't really see the point for an ereader to have this feature, however it will be something nice to have whether I choose to use it or not. One of the cons of the eReader that I have experienced is that B&N.com advertises emagazines for the device, however not all emagazines are compatible with the Nook and the subscription I purchased can only be viewed via the Zinia PC software program. I did not find this out until my impatience got the better of me and I had to call customer service. Overall, the ease of use of the Nook is incredible. I am very satisfied with my purchase and would recommend the ereader device to all my friends and family.  I think the consumer should really make sure when making a decision on purchasing an ereader to do their research. Make sure the ereader is a good fit for what you intend to use it for.  The Nook eReader is a versatile device and the recent software upgrade keeps it up to par with its competition.",5.0,Barnes and Noble Nook eReader,1272240000,"04 26, 2010",Electronics,1.0,,

When you pick up the pieces, many times there are no way to tell what you are holding, so you have to go by the shape rather than the picture to put it together.  Eg. one piece has just a colorful dot - with just this information, you cannot visually look for the next piece since it is not a continuation of a picture. You either have to consult the picture on the box to see which dot comes next, or try out each piece until you happen to come across the shape that fits the piece (which is my daughter's method).Similarly, the body part of the caterpillar is cut in such a way that you are looking at a green puzzle piece that all looks similar except for the different cut. No way to tell whether you are holding the caterpillar's neck, back, tail or the belly. So the way to complete this puzzle is mainly to work from the corner/side and find the pieces that fit each other by shapes.  While my daughter can complete the puzzle, this is not my (nor my daughter's) favorite.  I prefer puzzle pieces that when you pick up, you can tell what part of the picture you are holding and visually look for the next piece.PROS:- Beautiful shiny surface with brilliant color- Nice thick cardboard pieces (about 2mm thick) that is durable but not hard to put together or pull apartCONS:- Abstract picture.  Except for the face of the caterpillar and the fruits, you have to put the puzzle together by the shape rather than the picture.I bought this puzzle a little cheaper at Barnes & Nobles for $11.95 (instead of the current Amazon price of $15.99).I have bought puzzles by Ravensburger, Melissa & Doug, Mudpuppy and Kumon but our all time favorite is Briarpatch's ""The Good Night Moon"" puzzle.",3.0,Beautiful puzzle but pieces are too abstract,1371600000,"06 19, 2013",Toys_and_Games,0.0,,

Maybe it's that I'm 21 and part of the Millennial Generation and can learn how to use most technology without too much difficulty.  I love my nook.  The screen is easy to read, it holds a library large enough for me to take a lifetime to read, the e-book store is easy to navigate, it has twice the library size of the kindle (yes, many of them are low quality scans from google books, but they are still readable and in most cases free), the color touch screen adds flair when appropriate and hides the keyboard when not in use (unlike the kindle), the screen looks like the page of an actual book, and the nook looks seamless in general.Alleged problems people have with the nook:Slow page turn and power on.Touch screen not sensitive enoughFrequent crashesCan't jump to specific pagesIn my experience, the page turn is not bad at all.  Perhaps it is a bit noticeable at first, but just like turning the pages of an actual book, you cease to notice it.  In fact the page turning takes no longer than turning actual pages and probably less.  If the lag does actually bother you, try pushing the button as you're on the last sentence.  The split second that it takes you to finish the sentence will be more than enough time for the nook to turn the page.  This may sound more complicated than you would like, but once you've done it a couple times it will become habit.The touch screen is easy enough to use most of the time.  The keyboard buttons are a tad small and occasionally hard to tap, but in general it's responsive.  It is nice that it hides the keyboard when not in use, unlike the eyesore keyboard of the Kindle.I've heard of frequent crashes on the nook, but I haven't experienced them.  Every once in a while the nook has trouble loading and formatting a book (this does not include starting where you left off on a book, that's just fine), but if you wait for a minute or so, it resolves itself.The nook cannot jump to a specific page number, but it does remember the farthest point you've reached in a book, and it does allow you to jump to specific chapters (and sometimes sections of chapters).  With a few clicks of the page turning buttons (or swipes of the touchscreen), you reach the page you're looking for.  So no significant trouble.Problems I have experienced:Slow Power OnSlow FormattingThe nook does take a while to power up and format books (only occurs when switching to a new book, the nook knows what you're currently reading and keeps your place).  I will admit these are probably the biggest problems with the nook, but in general they are not that hard to deal with.  A few seconds of patience never hurt anyone, and once you've loaded the book, you're off to the races.Overall, I recommend the nook.  It has everything one needs in an e-reader, it's fun to use, and has the biggest library selection available.P.S.  If you're considering the iPad instead of the nook or Kindle, don't.  The iPad's screen strains your eyes.  How many times have you gotten a headache from using a computer screen too often?  Don't get me wrong, I love apple, and I'm writing this on a mac right now, but the iPad is just not the way to go for an e-reader.",5.0,Don't understand the negativity...,1264809600,"01 30, 2010",Electronics,1.0,,

Finch ""NTFinch""","[20.0, 21.0]","I am not disappointed with the Time Capsule, but am disappointed with some of the consequences associated with having it.  First, let me say that it offers a lot more customization than most people are willing to admit.  The network settings and ability to customize your network are just as good if not better than every other router I have owned.-The USB sharing works like a champ.  I am currently sharing two hard drives and a printer from the USB port.  I don't like that the drives won't mount to the desktop, but rather just show up like a shared folder.  It works though, so I have no real complaint.-Time Machine works well, although you can't transfer a hard drive with an existing TM backup to the Time Capsule.  You have to format and start over, which sucks.-The TC is a bit noisy, but no more than the quietest hard drives I have used.  It is definitely not as noisy as a Lacie or similar.-As of right now, I cannot connect my XBOX 360 to the TC.  I suspect that this is a flaw in the XBOX wireless adapter, and not in TC.  I will try hooking up an old router in bridge mode and see if I can get it to work that way.  I have also heard that there is a Linksys Wireless-N Gaming Adapter that works both with XBOX and with Airport Extreme-It is a bit large, but looks great.  I have heard others say it gets hot, but mine hasn't become anything more than warm.-I have experienced what others say is slow performance, but I have been told that the Time Capsule regulates network traffic depending what it is, which usually only applies to Time Machine.  It won't allow Time Machine backups slow down your network, which I like.  I haven't confirmed whether this causes problems with media and other files, but I did notice that certain files were accessed faster than some, and it seemed to back up the claim regarding network control. If that makes sense...Overall, I think it is a great deal, and I would recommend it to anyone that needs NAS and a solid router.**UPDATE:  I have solved the XBOX problem.

The strategy is not too tricky, but challenging enough to hold your interest.  Basically, you either collect or play train cards on your turn.  You need to have the same number and color to play on a route, and then you connect your routes to match the bonus on your ticket.  The score for routes increases by the number of train cards needed, from 1 point for 1 to 15 points for 6.  My only complaint is that there are a few tickets that might be weighted a little high and lucking into one of these on the initial draw gives a slight advantage.  You get a higher bonus to connect farther apart cities, but some of these have longer routes between them which give you a bonus already.

I also live in a rural area where finding people to game with is difficult, especially for people who like something more than party games. Furthermore, I have been really tired of video games and wanted to play some board games as a break from all that.I stopped playing D&D; when I was a teenager, because some idiot would ultimately become the strongest player/character thus intimidating other players and then turning on everyone either killing them, or making them his slave during game play. I eventually quit because I was so unhappy with these confrontations. No matter who the group was, these negative effects seem to occur.Recently I have been quite interested in the new D&D; board games that have been produced by ""Wizards of the Coast"". After watching many reviews on youtube, I decided to take a leap and buy ""The Wrath of Ashardalon"". I like the idea there is no dungeon master and you could play this solo.Box Opening/First Impressions:My first impressions upon opening the box was that of a kid at Christmas, with lots of beautiful pieces. Dungeon tiles, to amazing artwork on the cards, very nice looking rule book, etc etc. The figures could be used for your regular D&D; games and are high quality for plastic models.All the components are sturdy and well made which should stand up over time.Game Play:I have played many scenarios and I would prefer a bit more narrative. They give you the overall game feel about a village needing help from a dragon and then there is a few sentences about the scenario you have chosen, but not much more.However, I am a bit disappointed. ""TWoA"" seemed rather simplistic; draw a monster card, move, kill, deal with a ""encounter trap"", rinse and repeat. You don't really gain much XP, treasure or much for killing monsters, traps or any other deed. I have heard this game was BASED upon the 4th Ed. D&D; rules. Much of the game play was simplified as well. I guess this is my concern and I have tried to remedy this with some alterations.Playing games like World of Warcraft and Skyrim has made my idea of what a fantasy gaming should be? Because in many video games there is much more to do to keep you vested.I know I can hear some people say, that there are other scenarios like ""rescuing villagers"", but really the different scenarios are much the same. I have heard you can use other pieces and elements from the other D&D; board games.... but... I just wish there was more depth here.I have been altering the game to make it more flavorful and interesting like making more Encounter cards. I have taken the 3 good cards in that deck and made more of them (treasure, healing potion). Thus making the characters deal with more than just being attacked at every corner. I also have bought real metal coins for treasure so the ""clinking"" sound of loot makes it more fun. I plan more altering in the future to keep the game fresh and fun.In Summary:As Tom Vasel (from the Dice Tower) said in one of his game reviews, ""people often don't like games due to their preconceived ideas they have or what they wish a game would be""... and I would generally agree with that. I do enjoy this game and I appreciate the quality of the game pieces and artwork. This game basically has made it possible for someone like me to run a D&D; type game, even if I am a bit disappointed, I still enjoy this game. The price of the game is a bit steep for being so old. Still, the good replay value, the quality of the pieces made it a fairly good deal.One quick side note: Check out Mage Knight board game (by WizKids), another fantasy game that is awesome and good for single players.",3.0,"""Nooby-Part-Time-D&D-ers"" Game?",1359331200,"01 28, 2013",Toys_and_Games,0.0,,

There are 60 different figures in this set.  These are the first ""huge packs,"" so each booster comes with seven durable, pre-painted figures (including one rare OR one very rare figure), one of which will be a large OR very large figure.The first thing I look for in any expansion set are how many characters I recognize from the movies (vs. those that appeared only in the books).  I am particularly interested in figures from the original trilogy, and am happy to say there are at lest 22 figures from the original trilogy in this set.  Most are simply more powerful versions of earlier figures (for example, Lando Calrissian Rebel Hero, Darth Vader Jedi Hunter, Admiral Ackbar, Chewbacca Rebel Hero, Han Solo Rebel Hero, Luke Skywalker on Tauntaun, Princess Leia Rebel Hero, and Luke Skywalker, Jedi Master), but some have never been released before (for example, B'omarr Monk, Lobot, Nien Nunb, Wedge Antilles, and Rancor).  Notably, there are even a couple of great new common and uncommon figures from the original trilogy in this set (for example, Gonk Power Droid and especially the Stormtrooper Commander).Further, though I am not a big fan of the prequel, there are several figures from these movies as well (say 5-10 - though none of them stood out as particularly amazing/useful).  The rest are either from the books (including some that are very powerful), or generic/minor characters that I have never seen or heard of before (some of which are also pretty good and may be particularly useful in the Star Wars RPG).In sum (and as of the time this review was written), this is perhaps the second best expansion set for those interested in the original trilogy since Rebel Storm was first released in 2004 (with the Bounty Hunters expansion set being the best in this regard).  Those who like the Star Wars minis game and those who use the figures for the Star Wars RPG will likely be very happy with this set.ADDENDUM: (Please note that I include this addendum at the end of all my Star Wars minis reviews, so if you've read it before, there is no need to read it again.)  If you want to play the Star Wars minis game as it was designed to be played, it is best to have at least one starter (each starter comes with game instructions, a map, a D20, terrain tiles that are very helpful and add great variety to the game, and more).  I like the Rebel Storm Starter the best because it's from the classic era/trilogy, but the Clone Strike and Revenge of the Sith starters from the newer movies will also work.  If you don't want to invest in a starter, you can also get one of the three ""Ultimate Missions"" books, as each comes with a double sided map and a few smaller terrain tiles (again, I like the Rebel Strom Ultimate Missions book the best because it is also from the classic era/trilogy).  Or, you can buy the ""Attack on Endor"" scenario pack, which comes with TWO double sided maps (in addition to a scaled AT-ST that is fully usable in play).  The main point here is that you'll need some type of map/grid.  If you don't want to buy a Star Wars one, generic ones are also available at most gaming stores (you can use your imagination to set the scene, or draw terrain with an erasable marker right on the grid).  Of course, the minis are also useful for the roleplaying game (RPG) - in which case you may not need a starter or map, but will likely need the ""Core Rulebook"" instead.  Finally, they are just fun to collect for those who like all things Star Wars!",5.0,"Overall, a great expansion set",1168819200,"01 15, 2007",Toys_and_Games,1.0,,

If you are looking to really build you body up with an inexpensive, well made, extremely effective product, these bands are awesome. So, A few years ago I basically completed the P90 transformation program that was the predecessor to the P90X program. Instead of using weights I used bands and became an instant believer in their ability to build muscle. Now, fast forward a few years, I recently was given the opportunity to do the P90X program with a few friends as a competition with accountability so we will all finish the program at the same time. I got them all convinced that bands are the best way to go and we recently received our B.M.P. product bands in the mail. Below is what I think about the bands.1. First, Shipping was great. The bands came well packaged, on time, and were stamped with ""Priority"" and ""Take special Care"" stickers.2. The bands themselves are intense. As I mentioned, I have used bands in the past. The biggest problem is getting enough tension on the bands for various exercises. However, this set of bands basically trumps those worries completely. I am an in shape guy, and if I use all five bands at once, I can barely get them all up. The set of 5 gives PLENTY of resistance for any type of workout your going to be using.3. I did a lot of research before getting these and I really think you will be stoked about buying them. The materials are really heavy duty. I put these bands through some serious stretch and they are working tremendously.Hope this review helps, Like I said, I convinced the guys Im working with to get bands as well and they are just as stoked. Its funny to see them switch from weights to bands because they used to make fun of me for using the bands.... until they tried them. Now they realize how intense they are.

(If your system uses common DDR memory, STOP here, and look elsewhere, this won't help you...)My P4 had only 256 KB of RDRAM, and thus, running Windows XP, it was booting slow, and applications were also slow due to excesive Hard disk page (swap) file use. XP's performance monitors showed that RAM usage was at 98% almost all of the time, even with no open programs!!! And the Hard Disk activity was almost non-stop.I am not using this system for the latest and greatest gaming or other such demanding applications like photoshop, and so I don't need the latest hardware. XP's performance monitor showed CPU usage was less than 50% most of the time, so the CPU was doing fine.I thought that, since RDRAM never really caught on, nobody else would bother trying to find it to update this system. Also, most of the few RDRAM still for sale is very expensive.I could have just replaced the whole computer with a new one, but I felt that doing that, this system would have ended in the trash, which would be a shame since it's perfectly good. (Wouldn't help the environment either).And so, I searched long and hard for RDRAM and settled for the one for sale at Amazon: It suited my system perfectly and was reasonably priced.I must state that the seller I bought it from is RDRAM4SALE. They were clear that their product was Samsung instead of the Simpletech pictured, which was fine with me: I trust the Samsung brand.(E-mail RDRAM4SALE first: they helped me to choose the right RDRAM for my system).Be aware that not all RDRAM for sale on the web might be suitable for your system!!! You need to know your motherboard brand, chipset, speed, processor FSB...Also, if your system operates in dual channel mode, you MUST buy and install RDRAM in PAIRS. Otherwise, system won't work.Mine does, and so I bought 2 RIMMS of 256 MB each, which added to the already installed 2 x 128 MB RIMMS, gives me now 768 MB of RAM.Was it worth it? You bet!For about $42.89, my system is at least twice as fast!!! (Checked with a clock).XP's performance monitor shows RAM usage at about 65%, which is good enough. It takes a lot of open programs and open windows to see usage at the previous 98%.I am glad I decided to keep this computer. It feels better than many current PC's with dual/quad core processors. It does what I need, and avoided that it would have ended in some one's trash.Had I built a new computer, I would have avoided buying components in-route to obsolecense, and would had spent almost $1000.Since it performs so well, I'm sure I will be able to use it for a long time.

Jarrett ""SoundgardenFanForLife""","[2, 2]","Many bands who have a great debut are faced with the dilemma of making another album that will, by all costs, try to avoid the sophomore jinx. Some bands outdo themselves and make a great second album, but some end up falling flat and never surface again. In the case of Stone Temple Pilots second album (call it PURPLE or self-titled if you will), they avoid the sophomore jinx and make a terrific album full of sludgy, crunchy hard rock with some real surprises thrown in for good measure. Guitarist Dean DeLeo continues to throw out memorable riffs, and his brother bassist Dean DeLeo and drummer Eric Kretz continue to provide a great rhythm section for Scott Weiland's impressive vocal turn. He's lost some grit, but his voice is better on this album (he was still good on CORE) and he outdoes himself.""Big Empty"" is easily one of the best hard-rock singles ever released to radio, and the term ""power"" ballad might apply even though its dreamy hard rock makes it even more powerful (no wonder it was featured on THE CROW soundtrack). ""Interstate Love Song"" was one of the best songs released in 1994, and it demonstrates Stone Temple Pilots ability to craft a great song. And while the band still shows it's tough side on tracks like the thundering ""Silvergun Superman"", the percussion thunder of ""Lounge Fly"" and the thrashing ""Unglued"", they also show a melodic flair on the pretty acoustic ""Pretty Penny"" and the contemplative ""Kitchenware & Candybars"". Throughout this second album, Stone Temple Pilots have really crafted a very strong, memorable, and cohesive set that improves on the highly successful debut, which showcased a more raw, raucous sound. Other memorable cuts include the head-banger pleasers ""Meatplow"" and ""Army Ants"", and the very catchy ""Vasoline"". Not one bad song in this bunch, unless you want to count that incredibly cheesy ""hidden track"" which thankfully is left last so you can skip it.So thankfully, Stone Temple Pilots avoided the sophomore jinx and PURPLE (or the self-titled album) was another huge success. Thanks to instantly memorable songs and strong attitude, this album is hands down one of the best alternative hard rock collections ever released. Strong from start to finish, you'll find tons of reasons to enjoy this second helping.",5.0,STP Branches Out On This Impressive Sophomore Album...,1135728000,"12 28, 2005",Sports_and_Outdoors,1.0,,

There is no way to replace it unless you want to venture into cracking the case open and soldering the right kind of battery on.2) A lot of users, like myself, have the problem with the built-in storage spontaneously disappearing. The PPC doesn't ""see"" the drive anymore; it's like it doesn't even exist.3) Activesync frequently fails to sync some task and calendar items.4) Pathetic battery life.

It can be used as a board game or I can be used as an accessory set for your D&D RPG table top adventures.  The board game aspect of it, I rate it about 3.5 to 4 stars.  It can be fun if played with other plays but as a solo game (which it can be played), it gets boring pretty quickly.  I feel it shines most as an accessory product.  In this regard, I find it is the best value accessory item you could buy for D&D adventuring for its quality.  You get quality monster and player miniatures which are better than the flat tokens you get in other sets as well as customizable dungeon tiles that equal the quality of dungeon tiles sold is D&D tile sets, but have the ability to connect to form a dungeon as solid as a mat which wont break apart (because of a puzzle like design at the end of each tile).

I purchased a little MP3 speaker and 16gb sd card from Amazon to boost the sound and increase storage.I have found that I use my work and personal laptops less, because the Nook is more convenient to carry around and use. It is also more comfortable to type on than my smart phone. The Nook easily fits into most of my purses . . . even with with the cover I purchased for it. An added bonus is that it keeps my 7-year old occupied during long drives, while shopping, or when sitting in waiting rooms for appointments. He can read the interactive books or play with the educational apps that I have downloaded for him.Finally, I talked to my niece over the phone recently. She has started college classes.

I know that any sort of dumbbell set, with this range of resistance, would cost 5-10 times this cost.  Also, Black Mountain's Resistance Band set was a much better value than any other similar set I could find at the stores.That being said, I am still getting comfortable with excercises that I need to shorten the bands.  I have had some success with wrapping it around my foot, but there are times when it is still awkward - especially when using multiple bands together.  I assume I will be able to modify and tweek this in the future - for comfort and a better work out - but I am still working on this.All and all, I am very happy with the purchase and would recommend it to others.",4.0,happy so far,1334707200,"04 18, 2012",Sports_and_Outdoors,1.0,,

It's a good size, not made up of thin pieces, has a picture on each side, and is just plain cool. I don't know what some other people are saying regarding it not being durable- ours is just fine and isn't wearing away at all, even almost a year after buying it. The only thing bad I can say about it has to do with the box, and that's not exactly why you're buying this.One side of the puzzle shows Max, Moishe and Bernard as he leads them in their wild rumpusing. The other side is the image from the cover of the book, with Bernard asleep while Max's boat sails in the background. The images are supposed to be 'awake' and 'asleep', to teach your child opposites. I guess it does its job well, though I would've went with the image of Aaron and the big nosed Wild Thing sleeping for the asleep image, but that's just me. This puzzle is still good.9 pieces of thick puzzle pieces, not the sissy thin ones you get on 95% of puzzles out there. They come in a colorful box with a small rope to carry it around.

I comes out on top in everything.  Dell has thought of it all when it comes to this very handsome PocketPc.  I was very impressed when I turned it on and went to the internet and it set its self up for my wifi network. I thought that was going to me a nightmare and it turned out to be a dream. It works like a dream on the internet too. I can use it anyplace and that makes it easy to keep up on my email.It keeps my life in order with all the software that comes with it and there is so much to add if you need to. The free stuff is endless on the web.It plays and stores my MP3s like the best MP3 player. I can watch the latest movies on it while waiting to see the doctor or play great games to keep my mind busy while waiting for that doctor who seems to be takeing forever, but I don't mind I have my Axim X30.I can never find a piece of paper while out to take down an address or a note about something I don't want to forget and my Axim does that too. It takes notes and saves them with ease. Don't feel like writing? Well just press a button and speak your notes or anything else. You won't need one of those little tape recorders ever again.  Throw away your Day Runner. You won't need it ever again. This stores all that and more.I just can't list everything it can do because I would be writing forever but with software there isn't much it can't do. On the lighter side you can even use it for a flashlight or a mirror to check your lipstick!!I have had many Palms and PocketPcs and I have liked them all but none can come close to this one.  It's by far one of the very BEST there is out there. Its super fast too. You can add tons of memory with SD memory cards and they are so small.I really could fill up allot more pages just listing the things this little package can do but I think you get the picture.

My daughter likes to dress up like her favorite princess, so he wanted to dress up, too. This costume is better quality than I had anticipated, based on some of the other reviews. It runs a little small, my son is five and the Child M (7-8) fits well over his clothes. The boot covers pull on over the white jumpsuit pants, and the costume can be worn without them. The arm panels, however, remain attached. The suit has an opening in the back, under the hood, for the child to get into it, and the opening has two Velcro dots to close it. This makes it a little bit awkward to get into, and especially awkward to take off to use the bathroom. To use the bathroom, you have to take off the whole top of the costume, and then hold onto it so it doesn't touch a dirty bathroom floor (I definitely had to help my son with this in a public bathroom).

It claims to have support for common image formats such as jpg and bmp but in actuality it does not. The only way it can display an image is through its screen saver which would be ok except the screen saver can not be cycled and pops up a random picture from a folder so there is no way to view a specific file.  If you try to access any images from a folder it will give you an error saying &#34;this nook cannot read this file.  It may be an unsupported format.&#34; I have tried both bmp and jpg formats from different sources and received the same error even though the screen saver can read and display the very same files.It also claims to support PDF files which it sort of displays but it will not let you zoom in on a pdf. The reader also can not be put into  landscape mode which makes the text of most pdfs so small they are impossible to read.  Also when showing a pdf they aren't even expanded to take up the full screen making it even harder to read them.Barns and noble &#34;leaked&#34; the fact that there is a hidden browser built into the nook but this browser is so buggy that you cant even do a simple google search on it. The browser is so useless that it would have been better to not include it at all so you could have a bit more storage space which brings me to my next point.  Out of the 2 GB on board memory you are only able to access and store 250 MB of info.Another disappointing aspect of the device is its battery life.  The Battery although fairly good at 1 month is much shorter then the 2 months stated for the device.  Had the appropriate 1 month battery life been stated i wouldn't have a problem with this but stating it lasts 2 months on a single charge is a drastic over statement of its capability's especially when it would drain in under this time just siting in standby.The reader only has two things going for it.  First it has an micro SD memory card slot which is necessary sense it has so little space for storage and this device can be rooted (which will void your warranty). Once you root it software can be installed which allows you to over come most of the devices shortcomings but rooting it voids your warranty and is in no way officially supported.  Rooting can be a long task if your not use to android terminology although if your already familiar with developing on android its a pretty simple process.  Rooting also drastically reduces battery life dropping it from approximately 1 month battery life to 3 days or so with the standard android install but this can be brought back up to 1-2 weeks battery life by modifying a few of the system files.,1.0,Horrible Software Good Hardware,1398643200,"04 28, 2014",Electronics,0.0,,

Not a dealbreaker, but I wish they would modify it match and it would just be more seamless in looking better together with the main game.All in all, each expansion is fun and exciting.",5.0,Great expansions!,1402963200,"06 17, 2014",Toys_and_Games,1.0,,

I didn't feel rushed through the lessons at all and the whole process played to my strenghts and weaknesses in the second language much like a glove would fit on one's hand. It seemed very natural and somehow specific to my needs as a learner. The headphones are of nice quality and the authentic input from native speakers comes through very clearly. If you are in need of a great review of a second language or if you desire to pick up a foreign language, I highly recommend Rosetta Stone software.The reason that I didn't give this software 5 stars, is that the voice recognition element doesn't seem to be quite accurate. At one point I was repeatedly missing a pronunciation of a word, and out of frustration I said the word with the worst French accent I could muster up, and lo and behold!

I have to use two hands with the Kitchen Aid juicer I own and the Kitchen Aid requires more pressureThe handle  has a habit of swinging down but as long as you store it in the down position and hold it in place while using it there is no problem.It is too low to fit a large glass under it but I just use a measuring cup then pour it into a glass, if they made the space under the spout higher it would increase the overall height of the machine and would not fit under the cabinets above the counterAll the negative points are minor but the big problem with the machine is only important if you prefer pulp in your juice. This machine produces pulp free juice, I happen to like mine with pulp.I have had a juice attachment for my Kitchen Aid mixer for a few years and I liked the fact it produces juice with lots of pulp but the Kitchen Aid is a pain to clean, I don't think the Kitchen Aid is dishwasher safe, and it was more difficult to assemble and use. I was going to try to sell the Kitchen Aid juicer attachment but decided to keep both. I'll use the Kitchen Aid when I want to go through the extra trouble to get pulp and the Jupiter when I don't want to bother with the extra work with the Kitchen AidSo if you prefer pulp free get this machine, it is easier to use, and clean, it's dish washer safe and it is a sturdier design than the Hamilton Beach Juicer Model #932.

Plus side folks are going on and on that you need a freezer cold enough, and that ingredients should be cold (""prepped a short time in the freezer""), that you should make smaller batches, or you should re-freeze after wards.  All of these to me defeat the easy and ""automatic"" statement/purpose.  If I have to refreeze the ice cream, then why wouldn't I have made this in a soup bowl, and re-freezed, and saved a bunch of money.  And my freezer is set to the coldest setting, and apparently still isn't good enough for this thing.  Now what?  Go to ""11""? (spinal tap reference folks)The only pro I can think of is it is relatively quite and pretty easily to clean.  That's a plus.Ohhh, and ingredients aren't cheap.  Sure you health concerned folks get to make everything with the most natural ingredients, but expect to pay what you do for ice cream at the super market NOT on sale.

I've had this for about an hour and it will be returned to the store tomorrow.

Especially if you want to read magazines.It was VERY easy to use - even my grampa could figure it out.  The page turns are quick, clean and the device responds like a dream.  Just what I wanted!So why did I return it to the store?  THERE IS NO 3G on the Nook Color.  Had I known that, I wouldn't have wasted my time but every single review I read said ""3G + WiFi"".  Nope.  And the salesman ASSURED me it has 3G.  Nope.  It only comes with WiFi.  No hot spot?  You can't set the thing up.  And if you can't set it up, you can't even read the manual.While I was impressed with it at the store, I am bitterly disappointed that it was mis-represented as 3G when it is NOT.  What's the point of having this fantastic thing when it won't work where I live?  I'd have to drive all the way into town to find WiFi and if I'm there I might as well just go to the used book store anyway!The touch screen is easy to use and the navigation in the store seemed intuitive and simple.  I really looked forward to using this and I can't.My computer is so old that it can't/won't ""see"" the device and there is no way to tell it the Nook is there (it doesn't come with any software, either).If you live in a larger city where you can get WiFi hotspots all over, then this would probably be a nice thing to have.  But living in the hills with no WiFi and an old computer makes the Nook Color absolutely useless to me.Update:  The B&N; online store only takes credit cards.

I had forgotten about how initially disappointed I was that the ""chrome"" base was chrome-painted plastic, until recently reading all the reviews.  I bought this blender based on the reviews 2 years ago (I guess it was still relatively new back then), the name brand, the look of the jar and keypad.  I have been using it regularly only recently to make baby food and hummus, and it has already stopped working.  I suspect it would have stopped working a lot sooner if I had been using it more regularly prior to now. I haven't yet opened up the motor to see what is wrong with it, but I suspect it's the broken plastic gearing mentioned in several reviews.  The ""on"" button lights up but pressing any of the blend functions does nothing.Incidentally, I was able to get hummus and baby food pretty smooth, but it did take a long time, as does blending ice drinks.  You have to have enough liquid component in addition to the food solids to get the chunks to fall down to the blades and blend.  Otherwise the blade just spins inside a self-created air pocket, and doesn't blend anything.  I think this is fairly typical, but from reading reviews on the Osterizer Beehive and Waring blenders, this is less of a problem.Oh yes, after blending for awhile, one gets that smokey smell from the motor.

That idea appealed to me so that I went straight to Amazon and bought my first ice cream maker. Just two days ago, my Cuisanart Ice Cream Maker (1 1/2 quart) arrived and the freezer bowl went straight into the freezer.  This ice cream maker is very easy to use and comes with very clear instructions. I discovered that you must follow the instructions exactly.  The ""blade"" must be seated in the bowl, the lid put on, and the power turned on in that exact sequence before pouring the ""batter"" into the freezer bowl.  If that sequence is not followed the lid won't fit properly.  One of the real plus factors of this product is that it is easy to make only a pint at a time, since I am experimenting with a variety of flavors.  The fact that the ice cream is soft when finished is also a plus factor for me because it is then easy to pour the ice cream into my pint containers. If the finished product were as solid as it becomes after going back into the freezer, it would be too hard to get the ice cream out of the freezer bowl and into the pint containers.

It's simply too heavy, large and bulky. The main advantage this player has is it's rather large 6 GB capacity, which I never was able to fill. However, it's negatives outweigh the positives. After using it for a couple of months, the batteries stopped holding a charge, and would only give me a half hour or so of play time.The issues mentioned in my old review such as the inability to fast forward/rewind and inability to upload songs from the player have been resolved with recent firmware and software updates. The headphones are great, and they served me for a long, long time, even after I stopped using the Jukebox itself.In my opinion, it is a far better idea to purchase a portable CD player that is able to play MP3 CDs, such as a Sony MP3 CD discman. It's far cheaper, lighter and easier to use. However, you obviously need a burner to burn the MP3 CDs... or, go buy a newer generation of this product!OLD REVIEW --I just got the Creative Nomad Jukebox today (in blue!) and so far I absolutely love it. I even rollerbladed with it. True, it is a bit bulky, but thats only because it has a laptop hard drive inside it. And hey, it may drain the batteries (or so people say), but when I used it for my 30-45 minute roller blade trip, it served me well. The batteries didn't die on me, and it was almost fresh out of the box. The batteries hadn't even had much charging yet. I don't have any idea why the people are complaining about the headphones and the volume settings. The headphones are comparable to the Sony Backphones, which are probably the greatest lightweight headphones ever made. The headphones are a bit tight out of the box, but I'm sure they will loosen with time. As for the volume issue, you've got to be either deaf, or standing in the middle of a busy airport runway if it's not loud enough for you.  The annoying things about it are:  1. The lack of fast forward/rewind functions  2. The large size (about the size of a Sony Discman player) 3. The delicate state of the player (Although I haven't done this, I don't think a Hard Drive would survive a fall) 4. The player's software doesn't allow you to download songs from the player into the computerThe positive features are: 1. SUPERIOR sound quality 2. Tons of EAX settings, and other sound settings. 3. EXTREME capacity. I dont think I will ever be able to fully use up the 6 gigabyte capacity of this great MP3 player. 4. Comes with an AC adapter. 5. Comes with a leather carry case. 6. The super-fast file transfer time. You can load a whole album on this baby in under 3 minutes. My old Parallel Port MP3 player took 15 minutes for about 3-4 songs. 7. The player comes preloaded with hours of music of different genres, including Pop, Classical, Rock and Electronica.All and all, the positives outweigh the negatives. Of course, you could wait for a better player, but why?

The freezer is a variation on the popular &quot;Donvier&quot; type ice cream makers with a cold insert that is previously frozen and a churn paddle that stirs the mixture and shell-freezes it to the sides of the cold container. But instead of hand-cranking the shell-frozen ice cream, the Cuisinart has a well-designed paddle that is angled perfectly to scrape the ice cream off the sides as it freezes. In 20 minutes, you have a frozen treat that is ok for low-carb diets if you follow the recipe.A couple of hints; I froze the container well in advance, and after making the ice cream, I washed, dried and froze it again for its next use. The ice cream custard was cooled to room temp and I used a dairy thermometer to measure the temperature. Chilling the custard would have resulted in an even firmer mass, but I was impatient. In either case, non-sugar ice cream will set up very hard in the freezer, so it's best to consume it on the same day you freeze it, and serve it soon after you make it.This is a very economical alternative to expensive freezers with built-in refrigeration, and works much better than the hand version of the device.",5.0,This works like a charm,1067472000,"10 30, 2003",Home_and_Kitchen,1.0,,

(See my ""How To"" guide for organising an unforgettable Harry Potter party in the ""So you'd like to ..."" section)The one I got came with a fancy clasp to hold the front of the cape together.  It was a little big, so I had to hem it and roll up the sleeves.  Even after hard wear and much abuse at the party it washed well, and looks like new.  He will probably still have this costume when Books 6 and 7 come out.The wand is realistic, but with young children you have to watch out for them hitting other children with it, as it's pretty solid.The glasses are also very authentic looking, and fits all faces (mine included).  Again you have to be careful with younger children as it tends to slide off little noses, and the glass might break.  I haven't had any problems with it mind you, but it could happen.  The lenses get dirty quickly also.The transfers are a very nice touch, and they go on easily with a little water.  Even squirmy kids can be decorated without too much fuss.  They last a couple of days if you don't scrub them too hard in the bath.  I removed my son's own, because it was so realistic that people kept coming up to me asking if he had fallen and hurt his forehead.

I think the 7"" screen is too small for me. I wish it was 8 or 9 inches. However in the overall the Nook Tablet seems nice. I am still exploring all its features.  I find there is a total lack of instruction of how to use them. For example photo transfer from phone to Nook or from Mac to Nook.  There are 2 places were to allocated photos: Gallery and Photos.  The Gallery seems linked directly to a google account. I am still struggling to get through this.  I want to customize the tablet better for my personal use, and I am still learning, thus for the time being I will give it 4 stars.Not all screens of the tablet can be zoomed in either and this is very bad. Barnes and Nobles books reviews about e-books is one of them and this is why I wished I had a larger screen.I have NOT used the Barnes & Noble library download feature, I use Kindle app instead.The e-mail set up is also annoying as well. It assumes user has a gmail account and setting up different emails is not easy. I have fixed this by directly using webmail account access.Not all apps are  available for Nook tablet either. Some of them (quite popular ones as well) are only available for iPad or android phone. I do not understand why since this is an android platform they do not work with Nook. This is something hard to determine previous the purchase of the tablet and until in need of a specific app. Perhaps not necessarily the fault of the tablet manufacturer, but still irritating.I will leave a better detailed review when I learn all the features of the tablet.***UPDATE April 22.2014The more I use the Nook the more I dislike this tablet. I originally graded it 4 stars but a series of technical problems is forcing me to give it 3 stars.Kindle app continuously freezes or crashes.  Tablet reading feature lights up  as problem as well: it seems to get stuck on a low light dim mode and needs to be adjusted frequently.  Since Barnes & Noble library availably of selection is much inferior to the Amazon one in many ways including price of ebooks, Kindle is a must for avid readers.WhatsUp app is not compatible for this tablet either.Skype app works with the Nook but it is almost useless since the tablet lacks of camera. This is NOT a feature I was looking for initially, but I am now.I even downloaded a free office/document program called King Office, which isn't that bad.The tablet syncs automatically with the contact list of android phone but doesn't recognize a cable connection for photo transfer between the phone and tablet.  I truly dislike the sync part where my contacts are displayed on the tablet. I had to manually hide and remove that option.Google+ and Google icons along with Gmail icons populate the tablet and this is also very annoying.  I am still trying to figure out how to completely eliminate that.I will continue to update as I use it but my opinion about this tablet is that if you are looking to go beyond the e-reader use you are going to be somewhat disappointed.",3.0,Some problems,1396396800,"04 2, 2014",Electronics,0.0,,

I also resisted getting an e-reader for years.  I like to turn pages when I read.  However, I played around with this e-reader at the Barnes & Noble counter and was instantaneously and totally hooked.  It is an absolute pleasure to use.  The images on the screen are clear and crisp and the adjustable font makes it easy on anyone's eyes.  The color is glorious.  I liked the social connect to Facebook and found web surfing no problem at all.  The one drawback is that the Nook Color doesn't come with 3-G yet so if you're not at a Wi-Fi hotspot surfing will have to wait until you find one.Setup was very easy; the directions are all on screen.  You have to charge it up before you start using it and this will take about three hours.  After charging it up you have to register your Nook Color before you can begin using it, and if you don't have Wi-Fi at home you'll have to take it to a Barnes & Noble or any other hotspot to complete the process.  Once that's done, you're off and running and can start downloading books, magazines, or whatever.The magazine selection is somewhat limited at this point although I understand more will become available.  But as far as books are concerned, the sky's the limit.  I was able to download books I never thought would be available.  And the prices are unbelievable.  The complete Jane Austen (all six books plus some extras) is available for 99 cents.  Most other books run between $3.00 and $10.00, and I was able to find a few freebies that didn't cost a dime.I love my Nook Color.

I love the blue tooth / Hands free operation ... especially while out on the water.  I typically keep my phone hi and dry and just wear the backbeats.  Listen to music, make calls, answer calls....  75 The first pair I owned were lucky enough to take a swim in the salt water with me.  I powered them down and left them off for several days and they were BETTER then new (lasted for two years after the corrosive sink) I think the salt water messed up the built in microphone function and they were all the better without it!!!!  I bought 2 more sets for my kids - they ended up being mine.  I have since bought two more pairs and think the - 903+  - do not sound as good as the original.  The 903+ seem to distort way more.  Just my experience.  I have finally lost my original pair after several years of use but I will continue to purchase these headsets because they are perfect for me.  I always have two pair... one in use and one charging.  The battery lasts very long but I usually have a pair connected.  Depending on the actual set, they sound pretty darn good.  Also, many headsets claim to isolate or eliminate outside noise (which is great at times), however, these allow you to stay in tune with the rest of the world - with the volume turned down, you just look like a geek thats gotta have his/her headset in.  You can choose to listen to people talk or sometimes you  just have to switch your focus to your music or book while other just continue on with their bla bla bla bla.  Honestly, a great value.

The product appears to be made from high quality materials. I like the ability to combine different bands to generate more resistance. The door anchor allows one to replicate similar exercises found with weight machines at the gym. BMP customer service was excellent. I contacted BMP after one of the bands broke. I received a replacement within 5 days. These bands have a lifetime warranty. I strongly recommend purchasing an extra set of handles and door anchor. This saves you the hassle of constantly unhooking and hooking bands. One can get a great workout with these bands.

So far, we have used several types of ice cream toppings for this (hot fudge, caramel, butterscotch) as well as strawberry and red raspberry jams that you can find in squeeze bottles in the jam/jelly aisle in the grocery stores.We are extremely pleased with the Cuisinart, and recommend it highly.DHDK Peters",5.0,One of Life's Little Pleasures,1170633600,"02 5, 2007",Home_and_Kitchen,1.0,,

And I'm not rich enough to buy myself an iPad :DSo I was looking for a simple e-reader without bells & whistles, MP3, 3G, video playback capabilities and other stuff I won't use anyway, because I have an mp3 player for music, laptop for games, internet and movies, and I needed another piece of hardware to just read. Yeah, I'm all for ""divide and conquer"" and don't like combining everything in one :)Getting to the point - this device is just what I wanted. Text quality is great: ""paper"" is almost white, letters are black, just what I expected form the latest generation e-ink. The screen itslef barely blinks even without any kind of special protection (of course if you don't try to put it right under the lightbulb). Page-turning buttons could be a little easier to press (that's why I gave it 4 stars in ""controls""), but who needs buttons, when you have a touchscreen anyway?What else? Well, controls are easy to learn, but in case you forget something, the user guide is already inside as your first available book. Easy to hold in hands, however I recommend you to buy a protective case for it to make your reading even easier and more comfortable.

While the older two have yet to really finish anything, the youngest was very eager to get started on the project. I chalk this up more to their personalities rather than how age appropriate the product is.I sat with him and made sure he adhered to the guidelines, which I would recommend. There are limits to the number of words each page can have. So it helps to sort work as an editor to the process in order to keep everything flowing smoothly.Once we were done and sent it out, he checked the mail constantly. It arrived within a few weeks, and we were both really excited to hold a copy of the book in our hands. It's a durable, hardcover book. And I think it gave a real sense of accomplishment for him to have made this PRODUCT, this thing that you could hold onto and show people. His ""what I want to be when I grow up"" became an author. He would frequently relate this to his teacher and grandparents. I think it gives a real connection to the creative process, and we both really enjoyed working on it together.I will say that the only, brief and fleeting moment of disappointment for him was when he realized the pictures in the book were his, and not some professional rendering of what he'd drawn. I had no idea he'd expected this, and quickly allayed the disappointment by telling him how great it was that he'd done it all himself.

It's a very sturdy latch.  This, unfortunately, doesn't help you take the infuser out once your tea is steeped.3. ) The infuser does have a very, very fine mesh, so much less tea 'dust' leaks out when you're steeping.  You'll still have some, especially from some of the finer mate blends, but much less than than I've had from other infusers.4. ) Strangely, the mesh stops about a half an inch above the bottom of the infuser.  So, when you take the infuser out, there's 2-3 ounces of tea just sitting at the bottom of the infuser.  If you're just going to throw that tea away, no harm done.  However, for a black tea that you might want to steep more than once, it becomes pretty tricky.5. ) Once you've removed the infuser, you cannot put the lid back on the pot, until you put the infuser back.

A few months ago, four of my fifth grade art students created and designed their own story along with their own illustrations. The first two classes they wrote a short story that depicted the relationship they had among themselves. The whole process was a self -discovery when they realized they liked each other more than they thought! It was well organized with a beginning, a plot, and an exciting finish. Then they divided the book up into five pages per person to illustrate each written page. Under my guidance, the four of them took pride in their creative drawings. We loved how the directions in the Illustory book kit were so easy to follow. Each step was explained in detail and the students had a blast choosing their book cover and design. There was tremendous satisfaction when we mailed out the package which comes with a handy stamped envelope. How nice is that! The books arrived promptly with no errors and the girls lit up like a firecracker when they saw their books. This company gets an A+ for instilling pride in children's accomplishments.

This is a far cry from beautiful,  intelligent Celeste Holm's portrayal of Polly - and the family's poverty,  clearly seen in the book, disappears, as the Sawyers occupy a beautiful  home and are close friends with wealthy Widow Douglas.Some of the plot  is distorted in ways that remove the charm of the original. Tom's taking  off to &quot;play pirates&quot; after Becky jilts him is changed into a  troubled kid's escape after Aunt Polly tells him how &quot;no good&quot;  his father was - the humour, and the engaging portrayal of adolescent  &quot;first love&quot; is gone. The theme of Tom's learning responsibility  is overworked, and sequences that are hilarious in the book (Sunday school,  classroom, etc) are largely left out. The enchanting Becky Thatcher is  reduced to a tomboy. And isn't much of the picnic sequence ruined when a  gathering of kids is changed to a song-and-dance outing for families? (Tom  Sawyer is quite realistic in its setting forth that kids are far more  concerned with themselves than fretting about parents - let's not turn it  into a commentary on &quot;family values&quot; a la 1990s political  correctness.)Johnny Whitaker's singing voice has all the appeal of  chalk squeaking on a blackboard.

You don't have to line it, as the canister has a removable plastic bin within, but I find it easier to then carry the grounds out and makes easier for me to keep the inside of the container clean.  The canister could be used for many other kinds of things: cookies, crackers, snacks, or even small toys or craft items.  The only drawback I've found is that it sometimes has to be pushed closed.

After each of 3 charging sessions lasting 8 - 12 hours the charge lasted less than 4 hours. Within seconds after the device was disconnected from the charger, the charge level indicator dropped from 100 to 75%. The battery I received is certainly a dudd. Take a chance -- if you like, maybe your luck will be better.Update: 12/6/2013:  Alright, I was annoyed with my purchase and thought I had made a poor choice.  I then tried to charge the battery using a charger with higher current USB capacity (1.5A.) After this the battery lasted a full 14 hours in my GPS while paddling between islands in the 10000 Island National Park. It is possible that current limiting circuitry in lower power chargers shut them down so that the battery never gets a charge if using a charger without adequate horsepower.  Try a charger designed for the CR-V3 Li rechargeable or a high current USB power supply before you decide to toss out the battery.New Update 5-21-2014. The battery has been used maybe 2 or 3 times a month, with full recharge before and after usage but now the battery is lasting only about 2 to 2.5 hours at best.

While the Observer is a more updated model they both share very similiar features and ease of operation.My first recommendation is that you do order this from amazon.com and be wary of the same item offered by ""market place sellers"".  At the time I initially placed the order amazon.com was out and the wait was estimated to be 3 to 5 weeks.  Since the item was also offered by another seller in amazon's referral system I placed an order and wound up with the wrong watch; turns out the market place seller didn't carry the black face model.  Fortunately amazon got a supply in and shipped my watch within 24 hours....good service.  The black face is a little hard to come by.Now then, to the watch itself.  First of all it IS big...but very light; almost as light as the titanium Observer I have.  The larger face makes it easier to read and Suunto has apparently gone back to the leather (waterproof) band, which I prefer.  Functionally, the watch is a full blown time keeper and (non GPS) navigation system including stop watch/chronometer functions, an accurate altimeter, a barometer and digital compass.  Both the compass and the altimeter are as accurate as I've found in analog portable units.  The alarms are sufficiently loud (unlike the only chink in the Observer) and my only criticism is that the back light is weak compared to the Observer, but that fault doesn't draw anything away from the 5 star rating.  Add the user replaceable battery (Suunto makes a kit that includes the battery, a water/dust seal and a new cap), the intuitive operating system and you have the ultimate back country time piece.Suunto was the first to offer this type of time piece and, in my opinion, still offers the best.  I've used their diving computers and field compasses for years and am a fan of the company's many products.

I was excited; I finally found a stylish case that looks somewhat professional that also has an integrated (albeit old-fashioned) paper notebook. [I also have a Dodocase and a Treegloo case, but of course, neither of them have notebooks attached.] So I had high hopes for this - and when I received it on Wednesday, I wasn't disappointed.The Good:- The quality of the case is exceptional. The leather exterior and the suede interior are very nice.- The iPad slides in and out of the case easily, and is still sturdy enough to ensure that it won't move.- The flap that secures the iPad in the holster seems to very well made, and is designed so it is one piece with the rest of the holder (as opposed to it being sewn on after the fact).- There are slots on notebook side of the case that allows it to be positioned in either the top or the bottom of the flap - this allows you to rotate the notebook around if you're left handed.- The case is a little padded, so it seems like I would do a decent job of protecting the iPad in the event of a drop.- All of the controls for the iPad are easily accessible- The notebook is a great size - not too big, not too small.The not so good:- The case is somewhat thicker than I would have expected. Not terribly so, but just having the notebook beefs it up a tad. I'd say its about a bit more than inch or so.- The binding is more rounded than it is square. This may be a personal preference, but I would like a more squared binding.- If you're left handed (I'm not) they instruct you to flip the case over so the notepad is on the other side. Unfortunately for lefties, this makes the iPad's home button on the top of the case,which may be weird.- The interior lining is a very light tan, so it may get dirty relatively easily.- The binding doesn't really seemed to be rigid at first, so it takes some finagling to get it closed so the top and bottom of the cover match up. I have a feeling this may improve as the casegets used more and the binding stars to develop some memory.- I have no idea how much a replacement notebook will cost for this thing, but like all Moleskine products, I imagine it will be relatively expensive. I suppose that should be expected, though.All in all, I'm very happy with the case. The fit, finish and overall feeling that it gives makes it a great option for those that are considering it for professional purposes, or casual use. But if you're left handed, you have to ask yourself if it is too weird having the home button on the top, and if the cost of the replacement notebooks make it worthwhile (rather than just using a Dodocase and a regular Moleskine notebook, for instance).But for me - its a no brainer.

You can also pull up videos on youtube, so that's a bonus.Battery: Not bad, but obviously won't last as long as the Nook or some of the e-ink units out there. You'll get about 3-4 hours if you leave the wifi on. Not sure about the non-wifi battery life right now, but since the company says it's 8 hours I'd say it's probably about 6-7 hours.Extras: You can change the font, screen background color, & a few other things. While that's nice, I couldn't help but feel a little underwhelmed by it. There's also the option to be able to toggle back & forth between the publisher default & your aesthetics of choice. You can also change the background on the main page of the NookColor, which is a nice touch. Since we're not supposed to change that with our store unit, I wasn't able to play with that any.Touch Screen: It's OK. Pretty easy to use, but a few times I found myself really having to wrestle with it to turn pages. Sometimes it would be too sensitive & I'd end up a few pages ahead of where I wanted to be. Not a deal breaker, though. It didn't happen enough to where I'd get overly irritated, but people who are all thumbs with touch screens will be irritated.User Friendly: It's not very intuitive to use. People savvy with e-readers & gadgets will be able to figure it out pretty quickly but people who are new to the scene will be pretty confused with everything. The unit for my store didn't come with any written directions- it was all on the unit. That means that if it's like this on the sale unit then that won't be all that helpful for the people who aren't able to navigate well on the unit.Overall: My opinion is that it's OK, but not exceptionally so. Go for the iPad if you really want something like this. (I know it's more expensive, but if you're willing to pay $300 then paying $500 might not be that much of a difference.) It's basically a Nook/iPad hybrid, but without the option for all of the extras & apps. (Of course if all you want is an e-reader & wouldn't use the iPad's extras, then this is great.) Overall it isn't a bad unit but it just doesn't have anything to really make it stand out. If you're a big fan of the Nook then go for this unit, but I'd play with it in the store first.The only two things that really make this stand out from the other e-readers on the market is that the unit is in color and that the internet on this unit is far better than some of the other options on the e-reader market. While the color option is great for children's books & magazines, this might not be enough for users who predominantly use their readers for plain print reading & that the ones who would want these things might already have it in the various tablets that are on the market.I did enjoy playing with the unit in my store, but I don't know that I would choose it over the regular Nook. Of course this is just my opinion, but again- before making a big purchase like this, view a unit in the store first.3.9/5",4.0,"Not bad, but might not sway many users of other readers on the market",1290729600,"11 26, 2010",Electronics,1.0,,

He really liked the show when we got him Jay Jay and Tracy. Playing with the toys has enhanced his enjoyment of the show. He actually likes the show better now.A responsible child development professional who hadn't seen the show didn't get it. After we convinced her that its not a Thomas thing, she asked, ""What does it do?"" That's just the point! IT does practically nothing; the kid does it all!The size is absolutely perfect for a child's hand. You really need to get two of the characters, though, because it becomes a thrilling two-hand experience.I think that part of the reason that these toys are so great is that they really look so much like the characters on TV. When my son watches the show, his Herky flies right along with the one on screen. I believe these toys actually promote active television watching.OK, now the down-side. The planes are guaranteed for 100 years, but every single plane has broken in at least some small way. They are very well made and durable, but my 2 1/2 year old is a formidable foe. I know these are not rated for kids under 3, and if you are not going to supervise your 2 year old's play, do not get these until she or he is a little older. I would say that the safe time is when your child stops putting just about everything in her or is mouth.An interesting issue with the warrantee: after I sent the double-broken Snuffy back for repair or replacement, I read the fine print. It said that plastic parts are not covered. Almost half of some of these toys is plastic, so I said Aha, there's the catch. Most of the breakages have been plastic. However, Action Products promtly sent a replacement Snuffy, even though both breaks were plastic.So, what does this all mean? I say, definitely buy it. One thing my son learned, was how to live without one of his favorite toys for a couple of weeks when Snuffy went ""on vacation.""",4.0,"Great, but 100 years?",1093564800,"08 27, 2004",Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,1.0,,

Actually, it's a band in name only, singer/guitarist Quorthon being the only constant, while other members are pretty much just hired  guns.  Since 1983, Quorthon has been churning out original, experimental,  and often unlistenable variations on death and black metal.  Bathory is  considered one of the originators of both those genres, most of the extreme  Swedish and Norwegian black and death bands of the early 90s claiming  Bathory as prime influence.  Bathory's early material is pure thrash, fast  and trebly, riffs sounding like a vacuum cleaner, blastbeats totally out of  control.  Over this raging din, Quorthon screeched out unintelligible odes  to Satan, making him, along with Venom, Mercyful Fate and Slayer, one of  the earliest groups to really embrace Satanic imagery (much of which sounds  goofy today).  Gradually, Bathory embraced more intricate riffs and the  lyrics moved from Satan to Norse mythology (again, Bathory blazing the way  for future Scandinavian metal bands).  By the early 90s, the music had  slowed down to a medieval/doom, nearly mellow sound recalling Manowar.  All  the while, the production job was always pretty loose, with fuzzy guitar  and bass and drums that were either inaudible or too boomy.  This  compilation haphazardly covers all of it.  More than anything else, Bathory  gets credit for originality, true weirdness and a complete disdain for  mainstream sounds.",4.0,"inconsistent, but one of the true innovators of metal",946425600,"12 29, 1999",Sports_and_Outdoors,1.0,,

Alternative grunge rock had taken hold right at the start of the decade with bands like Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Nirvana and Alice In Chains gaining widespread popularity. Plenty of other groups though were trying out the whole grunge trend. One of these bands was the Stone Temple Pilots. Originally coming on the scene in 1992 with their debut album 'Core', the 'Pilots were at first given the tag of being Pearl Jam rip-offs. However, with their debut the band showed they had the makings of becoming one of the great acts of the 90's. 'Stone Temple Pilots' (also known as 'Purple'), the Stone Temple Pilots second studio album, released in 1994 was the bands much awaited follow up to their successful first album. 'Purple' has in time grown to be the band's most popular album release. So, does 'Purple' really deserve the critical acclaim that it has been given.Let's make it simple; this album is a masterpiece. With this album, the Stone Temple Pilots totally found their sound. If their debut left some people writing the band off as rip-offs, 'Purple' completely smothers the idea. More than just a straight ahead hard rock, riff filled album, the Stone Temple Pilots reveal the more diverse side of their music, which is what in many ways gives the band their own identity and sets them apart from the pack. This album is alternative rock at its most refined. Breaking away from the 'grunge' mold (however you interpret that), this album is a mix of songs with powerful riffing (i.e. 'Meat Plow' or 'Silvergun Superman') and slower stuff (i.e. 'Big Empty'), plus not to forget the more diverse songs like the acoustically driven 'Pretty Penny'. On the whole, you can easily say that some of the band's best songs are on this album and you can tell this as the instrumentation and lyrics feel completely assured right through the album. Lead guitarist Dean DeLeo his brother bassist Robert DeLeo show how diverse guitar playing can be on this album, where we go from the harder more metal sounding riffs, to acoustic and country sounding moments. Scott Weiland's lyrics are at times crazy and other times powerful and cynical. However, the powerful vocal style the man has makes the words blend easily with the music. 'Purple' is quite simply one of those albums were all of the songs work without sounding out of place or inconsistent. 'Purple' is 11 years old but has that remarkably fresh appeal to it every time you listen to it.There is one thing though that really hacks me off about this album and the same goes for the album's follow up, 'Tiny Music'. You guessed it, its the back cover of the CD; there is no tracklisting. This is a mistake that you hope will be corrected in time because it always helps to be able to see whats on the album, especially when your viewing the CD over before buying it from a shop!So what about the 12 gracious melodies this album gives us. STP kick off their second album with 'Meat Plow', a heavy riffed opener. Weiland sings this one with a down and out style, a great opening song. 'Vasoline' fades in next, with some quirky guitar hooks and pronounced drumming. The chorus on this one is awesome where Weiland sings 'it isn't you, isn't me' to a great guitar riff. Next is 'Lounge Fly', a sonic sounding opening, with some more pounding riffs. Weiland's lyrics gives this song a pent up aggressive side. Things slow down next for 'Interstate Love Song', the guitar play is a perfect mix of hard riffs with a bit of a country sound. A great ballad styled song where Weiland sings about events past, and things/people you've left behind. 'Still Remains' keeps up the power driven riffs; again the band jam out a great chorus with some clever echoeing singing from Weiland. Eric Kretz drums out a great surprise entry towards the end of the track.'Pretty Penny' is one of the more diverse tracks on the album. Its got a great acoustic sound. Crazier lyrics follow with 'Silver Gun Superman'. You've gotta love the metal riffs to this one. For me though, 'Big Empty' is the greatest track on the album, Weiland yearns out the opening verse before the song builds into a great driving chorus, at its most powerful where Weiland screams 'conversations kill'. This song is a perfect mix of the bands melodic and experimental sides. The supercharged 'Unglued' follows, a 2 minute bashed out rocker that you NEVER get tired of playing again and again. 'Army Ants' starts suspiciously before building into another explosive song. However 'Kitchenware and Candybars' is a great change to finish the album. Again like a ballad, the song has a great orchestral addition at the end to accompany some luscious riffs and some emotive vocals. Keep this track running though for the twelfth song (its fixed onto track eleven), a funny song where Weiland sings about the 'second' album to the tune of trumpets and hammond organ!When people look back on the 90's era of music, yes they will think about the bands who set the trends like the Pearl Jam and others. However, im confident that the Stone Temple Pilots will also be remebered as one of the great alternative rock acts also, in no part due to this masterpiece of an album. This was the first STP album that I bought and I loved every minute of it from the first listen. A must for any rock fan; buy this CD, crank up the stereo and settle back and listen to 12 gracious melodies.",5.0,One of the top moments of alternative 90's rock,1128124800,"10 1, 2005",Sports_and_Outdoors,1.0,,

Since we also have light free weights, I wasn't sure if the bands would be used by participants, or would just gather dust. I also had more experience with the rubber strips which have the advantage of being very inexpensive. Unfortunately, they are not at all durable and hard to grip for some people.In fact, the bands became the most frequently used pieces of equipment in our program, exceeding the use of our weight sets. I receive positive comments about them, and some people who are not exercisers are nonetheless motivated to use the bands. The included ankle straps have come in handy.Now that I have used these bands for a while, I am pleased with their durability and quality construction.

For those who, like me, have never tried it before, here is a brief summary. The software immediately places you into an immersion (sights and sound) environment of still photography and phrases pertaining to the photos. You'll be asked to repeat phrases into the headset, and pronunciation counts (however, it's a great relief to those of us who can't roll our Rs that they allow for that!). You'll also need to type, and click on photos that match what is being said. This specific level attempts to teach basic Italian: colors, greetings and farewells, words that would come up in work and school environments, shopping basics, words for articles of clothing, animals, and the like.My background in learning foreign language is the old-style method of memorization. I would create flashcards of individual words. Repetitive writing by hand was one of the most helpful methods I used to learn--something that's not replicated with Rosetta Stone (though some typing is required). Rosetta Stone, in contrast to the old way of teaching, attempts to teach through immersion. Rather than memorization of one word, a word appears in context in a sentence (or shorter grouping of words), and English translations aren't shown. Rosetta Stone doesn't outright teach in English why a verb is conjugated the way it is, how to (or why you must) match an adjective to a noun, or have you learn specifically how to pronounce vowels and consonants. Instead, the software plunges you into learning by exposure to an all-Italian environment.However, this is exactly why Rosetta Stone may not work for a learner like me. Even though it's fun, it's nevertheless frustrating. I want to know how the words relate to my native language. While using the product, I can't help trying to translate everything into English and trying to understand why the grammar is the way it is. And because it's software, I can't go at my own pace. In high school and college, I would read forward to the next unit if I got ahead of my peers, and remove flashcards of words that needed concentrating on.Not knowing the rules of grammar can be frustrating to someone who learns the way I do. The software seems to be geared more toward those who learn visually. For anyone who has not already tried to learn a foreign language, or has found the old-style memorization method doesn't work for them, I would recommend trying Rosetta Stone. For those like me who have done very well with the old method, you may find it difficult to adapt to an immersion environment.",3.0,"""A"" way to learn, but not necessarily ""the"" way",1299196800,"03 4, 2011",Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,0.0,,

You can select multiple routes, which allows you to travel to different destinations at the same time, and while you do get points (visible points) for each route to lay down, you get extra points tallied at the end of the game for each ticket you complete, and because you keep your tickets hidden from other players, no one is aware of how many you have completed and how many points each of your tickets is worth.

This collection was recorded in the early 70's and pairs Jimmy with Gatemouth Brown on 9 cuts and Otis Rush on 4. As you can imagine when you have all of these guitar slingers on hand there will be some string bending going on and this was certainly the case here. Lots of stinging guitar on virtually every track. Dawkins handled the vocals and did a fine job. The songs are well crafted and mostly written by Dawkins. Sound quality is fine although the production seems to drop the band low in the mix a few times behind the guitars for short intervals. The liner notes do not detail who plays what solos so you will need to listen close to figure that out but it's all good stuff.Summary: quality modern electric blues with an emphasis on the guitar.

The web may be a little, very little bit slow, but that goes with most tablets; even the ipad. It plays youtube smoothly, has good screen quality, has email, and other web related things like netflix and pandora. This tablet's speaker quality is ok, but not if you're often working in a loud place.If you want a tablet for apps: Look elsewhere. This tablet, although is great for web quality, has a poor app selection. Some of the best ones, in my opinion it has are Temple Run Brave, Fruit Ninja, and several angry bird games, however according to buyers who have had the device longer, it took a long time for even those to come out. (I could be wrong; got that peice of info off other reviews)If you just want to read and have a little of everything above: Then this is perfect. If you're not so much into the web, not too crazy about apps, but still want it as a backup as you read, then this tablet is your type. It's simple, cute, and does well with it's tasks. Nice book selection; had everyone i searched forIn General:-There are no cameras, neither front or back, but if you don't do skype and don't really care about photos, it wont make a difference.-The apps and books they have are very expensive!I've seen nook apps (nook apps in general; all nooks)shockingly expensive while other tablets such as the kindle fire has those same apps for free-You can modify the brightness when you read books, and you can bookmark them as well.Overall, this simple tablet is for those who don't really care about apps. It does everything else quite well! Would probably make a nice gift for parents who enjoy reading but are kind of hectic (all their books in one place; the nook itself), or a young child who doesn't mind not having all the, ""cool"" apps.

I had a $50 giftcard (for Macy's) and have a strict policy to only use them for something I wouldn't otherwise buy.I have wanted an ice cream maker for years. I would look at them, think about them, and ultimately put them back on the shelves as I thought it was unnecessary in the scheme of life for another small appliance in my too-small kitchen.Well, expiry was upon me with the giftcard (yes, almost 2 years) and I now live in a VERY rural area, where a trip for a container of ice cream is a 40 mile round trip. Did I mention I ADORE ice cream??I finally bought this machine. My husband thought I was crazy and that I'd never use it. Made the first batch of chocolate ice cream yesterday and let me tell you it was fantastic!This will not go unused, my husband won't allow it. We both felt it was as good or better than store purchased ice cream without the chemicals they use to keep it nice for long periods of time in the freezer. Buy your milk and cream in large containers kids, you are going to a)save a little $  and  b) make a motherload of HEALTHIER ice cream. I used half and half instead of heavy cream and it was still delightful.I am on Amazon today to buy an extra freezer container. I do think that is a bit pricey and am considering the whole reconditioned unit so that I can make two batches simultaneously. It's that good.It DOES come out soupy when initially made. It's yummy that way-I dare you to not put a spoon in the top as it's whirring around, especially the first batch. Put it in another plastic container for a couple of hours if you prefer a harder consistency.Oh, as for the noise-come on people, it's NOT that loud!My standing fan makes more noise than this thing, and I'd rather hear IT whirring knowing the sweet treat awaits me!  Honestly, maybe these folks got a faulty unit, or are particularly sensitive to noise- I don't think it's noisy at all :)Only one small note to mention. When it's done try to get it out of the canister quickly because it freezes very quickly to a very hard consistency to the sides, and it takes a bit of scraping with a wooden spoon to get it off (but I had a heck of a taste test while I completed this arduous task)  !

I purchased a similar cat tunnel at Walmart for $10.00, half the size and it broke within a week.  The metal popped out.  This one is sewn better than the cheaper versions.  It is perfect for small to medium dogs.  I don't know about a large dog.  They could possibly crawl through, but could not stand up in it. The 19"" opening is accurate.

Rather than learning the language through its building blocks you learn it through more practical and real world scenarios.  This helps tremendously if you want to use this set as a prep for travel (which I think this is very well suited for).The Rosetta Stone app has voice recognition so you can practice with the app itself. I found it to be pretty good although sometimes I had to repeat myself several times to get it right. Although the upside of this is that it made me speak more clearly which ultimately is a good thing.I really liked the Totale aspect of this edition. The Totale part is an online companion with games to play that I enjoyed.  Not all of them are blockbusters but there are enough to chose from that I found it to be worthwhile.  My favorite part of Totale was being able to chat with people who actually speak French natively. It's one thing to practice a language and quite another to ACTUALLY try to speak it with someone. I found the people to be very patient and the experience very positive.I'd definitely consider using Rosetta Stone in other languages to prep for trips abroad.

I had big plans for the setup in our playroom and was incredibly disappointed. For starters if you buy the tents there is no option for left side vs right side on where the tunnel hole is located so in order to connect them one tent must be facing one direction and the other tent facing in the other direction. This will be fine if we set them up outside this summer but don't plan on an inside setup against a wall....won't work. The tunnel apparently just has to nestle inside the hole in the tent because there is no way to fasten it. The minute my kids started crawling through it moved and was out away from the tent. If they take it easy this wouldn't be a problem but seriously what child is going to carefully and slowly crawl through. I'm not sure why they say &#34;you can set up a whole city&#34; because there's one door and one hole in the tent so unless you are using the door to prop your tunnel in you can only connect it with one tunnel.

After researching the popular e-readers i.e. the Kindle Fire, I went with the Nook Color for one simple reason; the ability to Root it and turn it into an Android tablet, for a lot less! (It also takes a macroSD card). While you can find the Kindle rooted too, I found the Nook Color rooted was more readily available and more affordable. Since I was purchasing for a teen I  did not want to get a new or more expensive model.We purchased one that was already rooted to cyanogenmod 7.  You can also purchase an macro SD card here or on Ebay that is rooted for you if you already own a Nook Color.We connected it to our home wi-fi and Viola, she can do everything i.e. text free, download games and unlimited apps from the Market. The rooted Nook Color can do everything a tablet can do except for make or receive phone/video calls.Note, all rooted Nook Colors are not the same version.  We purchased one for our son for this Christmas and I did not notice it was not cyanogenmod 7.  This is relevant as it did not possess full access to all of the apps on the Google Play (or Android market) as our daughter's does.  You can update the Root software and I did that but I did not notice a change in its ability to download the other apps. But honestly, I was tired at that point and gave it to our son on Christmas as it was good otherwise and I doubt he would notice. LolThis model is perfect for my teens, but I am thinking about the Kindle Fire HD for myself because it has a good camera and I love photography.P.S. I also purchased a silicone case in yellow and it brightens up the dark tablet a lot.

It caught my eye because he liked the gunmetal color and a simple, masculine design.  I was concerned about the chainmail type of wristband, but 7 years later, nary a hair has been caught.  My husband said it is very comfortable, and doesn't build up moisture under it like other watch bands do, namely leather or plastic ones.  Other metal bands pinched and pulled, this one has remained smooth, cool and comfortable.The clasp is very secure, and thousands of uses later still clicks tightly onto the latch.  It is a double clasp, so even if the outer one pops up, you still have a chance that the other one will keep the watch on your wrist.The only issue we've ever had was a broken crystal, which was quickly replaced at no charge by Skagen.I agree with others that it has a particularly loud tick, which I'm not sure is the worst thing.  I can hear it when my husband takes it off at night, and I guess I find it a good background noise.  I only really hear it when our bedroom fan is off, which is rarely.Overall, excellent value, excellent quality, and excellent customer service, as well as a unique and handsome style made this watch an absolute winner.

After trying to clean it multiple times with various solvents and re-oiling it never felt too good. I have also used a gerber multi-tool but I didn't like it near as much as my Wave.Once I replaced my Wave I felt the Victorinox was just a slightly more expensive tool, but it has proven to be much more. I have used it at least twice a week (many times much more often) for the past ten years and it still feels great. The tool closes and stays closed all the blades still lock and are easy enough to remove. The driver set still works great, though many of the bits have been replaced due to wear and tear. The nylon pouch is tearing and is almost ready to be replaced, but this is to be expected after ten years of wearing this tool on my belt. The only problem I have with this tool is that many of the tools are difficult to unfold due to their recessed fit, but this is negligible especially in most cases since this is the tool to use when you don't have access to real tools. It has saved me on many occasions when my bike breaks down away from home, or anything else that needs a quick tweak. This tool also comes with a lifetime warranty.If you are in the market for a multi-tool I cannot recommend this one enough.

The ghosting was annoying at times, but wasn't egregious. But I did notice it. The main thing it did was make the text the slightest bit blurry at times (i.e., not crisp). Made me feel like I needed my glasses (which I don't need for reading).I was shocked that there was no browser or email client. I'm not expecting an iPad, but the Kindle lets you at least browse the web. Yes, you could access a browser sort of, but it would randomly kick you out of wherever you were at and send you back to the search feature.For those looking to root it:It wasn't terribly difficult to root, but for me it really wasn't worth it. Things just don't work that well. You can probably make things work, but for me, it would have required a significantly higher time investment to get things acceptable than I was willing to give it. For instance: Text on web sites was often not sharp and difficult to read, images looked bad, and the inability (that I could find) to remap the primary buttons to quit going back to the stupid B&N; interface made it difficult to navigate. Additionally, ""search"" in the app store didn't work, and on some menus of the the OS the text was not visible at all (you had to guess what the icon was referring to and hope it wasn't anything bad).Over all, it was simply disappointing. Perhaps I was expecting too much from a $140 device with ""simple"" in the name. Oh well. I ended up returning it to Staples.",2.0,Unimpressed.

I was really set on the Kindle but after reading some more about the Barnes & Noble Nook it really clicked with me.  I liked the idea of a user-accessible battery, and the formats that are compatible with this e-reader.  The B&N; ebook library had a much larger selection at the time and of books i was really wanting that I couldn't find on amazon.  At first the touch screen seemed ridiculous and somewhat pointless, this caused me to really lean towards the Kindles as I figured it would really drain the battery and was more of a gimmick than a necessary part of the device. BUT after using the Nook it just makes navigation quick and awesome, totally won me over and I hope on the next gen they don't decide to do away with the touch screen.  You can set it to shut off when not in use for a few seconds and the battery lasts quite a long time.  When the touch screen is off it still works to turn pages.  You just swipe your finger across the dark screen, pages turn, it's quite nice.E-readers in general didn't click with me, didn't think I'd really use it as anything more than a ""toy of the week,"" but after the first 2 weeks my Nook has become probably my favorite device that I've gotten, over my ipod even, i just love it (and it's so sleek too).  Navigating the bookstore is incredibly simple and I LOVE being able to read reviews online with it for books and making wishlists.  Finding selections of free ebooks is a snap.  The e-ink screen is amazing, if you haven't tried reading on one do it.  It is definitely superior to trying to read on an lcd screen.  Being able to change text size is also a huge plus (pretty standard on all ereaders, just stating my love for the option).  I haven't had a single software/hardware problem at all so that is great.  The only thing i hope they update on the software is making it possible to organize books into customized categories/folders (unless you can and I just don't know how).Supposedly you can link up to 5 Nooks to one account so they can all share the same library of ebooks you've purchased so now I'm trying to get my family members to buy Nooks as well!

The Franklin eBookman had nice hardware but dreadful firmware with more bugs than you would find in a swamp in summer.  The Ectaco Jetbook Lite had a number of glitches in its firmware as well, plus an extremely user-unfriendly upgrade method.I did encounter one major problem with this Nook Simple Touch -- the life of a battery charge was nowhere near the several weeks promised (with wifi off).  Fortunately, however, I called B&N; Customer Service, and they advised me to install the latest firmware, V1.0.1, which addresses the power issue.The upgrade proceeded easily and without glitches, and it seems to have solved the problem; though I haven't put the duration of a battery charge to the full test yet, the charge indicator is holding at 100% after a full day, including more than an hour of reading.  That compares very favorably to the 83% discharge rate I had been experiencing in just three days using the old firmware.  I will report back if the battery problem returns.Otherwise I prefer the Nook Simple Touch's ergonomics to the comparable Kindle.  The Nook's front is all screen, with no unnecessary keyboard keys.  Virtual keyboard keys appear onscreen when you need to search for something.  The unit fits nicely in the back pocket of my jeans or shorts, and it's trim and lightweight.There are convenient page turning buttons flanking the screen, making for easy one-handed operation in a subway.  You have a choice of font styles and sizes, and the screen is easy to read even under bright sunlight.  You can touch any word onscreen to get a quick dictionary definition (provided, I found, that the word isn't hyphenated and run on two lines).I like the ease with which you can download titles from the public library (you download to Adobe Digital Reader, which your library provides free, and then transfer the Epub books to your Nook with the USB cable provided).  The program recognized my Nook without any glitches.I also like being able to read any book for an hour a day FREE at the nearby B&N; store.Newbies should note that, in their apparent effort to keep the NST instructions short and simple, B&N; left out a few useful ones.  Notably: to close one book (so you can open another), press the Nook button below the screen (the thing that looks like an upside-down U) and enter ""library.""  To lock the Nook immediately, without waiting for it to enter sleep mode, press the power button on the back briefly.  And to tell when the Nook has finished charging, wait for the little LED next to the USB input on the unit to turn from amber to green.So if you have been looking for an ebook reader offering great value and ergonomics, take a look at this Nook.  But make sure to upgrade to firmware V1.0.1 or higher!)UPDATE: Trust me to find the bugs in an ebook reader -- or perhaps they find me.  At any rate, I bought a copy of the American Heart Association Cookbook (7th Edition) and was dismayed to see some of the fractions describing quantities in recipes replaced by question marks!I emailed B&N; Customer Support, and they suggested that I try downloading the title again (which you do by archiving and unarchiving a title, whatever that means).  That didn't work, but I found that if I clicked the check box on the font selection screen marked ""Publisher's Default"" (or words to that effect), that seemed to solve the problem.  So if you're seeing question marks in any titles where numbers should be, try that solution!I sure love beta testing new products for these big companies -- NOT!",5.0,The Right Touch,1314489600,"08 28, 2011",Electronics,1.0,,

She loves to write and draw, so it was a perfect gift.  We bought her another one last year, so she now has 2 of her own published books. :-)  These are wonderful keepsakes to have to show your children's creative sides.  My 5 year old wants one now too, even though she is only a beginning writer.  I have also purchased several to give as gifts, and they were all well received.I think overall this is a fantastic gift for a child, and am planning on purchasing more in the future. Much better than the same old plastic toys that get used for a day and then never played with again.  These would be my only recommendations/constructive criticism:-The last book that we got didn't have an area to check off and pay for the 'About The Author' page.  It was included in the first box, which was why I knew about it. That was one of my daughter's FAVORITE parts!  So glad that we still got to do it, since I called and asked if that was still an option.-The order sheet could be less confusing.  Perhaps it has since been improved, but I thought the last one wasn't very clear. Just seemed confusing.-I would make it VERY clear that all of the pages that are included with the book are NOT pre-paid for.  Perhaps have 2 separate packs of paper: one that includes the pages that ARE included, and the rest could be clearly labeled that they are extra (fees) if used.  With the first book, my daughter immediately wrote out her story using all of the papers, so I was pretty much forced to pay for the extra.

I had it in my head that if I bought this ice cream maker I would save money on the cost of satisfying my habit. I was so wrong! It makes sense, now that I think about it, that all-natural rich ingredients are costly - especially in this economy. Many of the recipes call for heavy cream and whole milk, as well as chocolate. These ingredients cost so much right now that I haven't been using my machine very much. Sad, isn't it? The only product problem I encountered was when I tried to save money (and calories) by using light cream and light milk. The taste was so-so and the texture was awful.

Let me say right up front, these resistance bands give you one great work-out. If you are just a little creative, you can offer yourself a truly wonderful work-out. I need the flexibility to change my work-out, I am disabled, so I am unable to work with traditional weights, like most people. I want to let you know I no longer feel left-out, because today with Black Mountain resistance bands, I can create a work-out like know other. These bands are great, and what a burn. Now don't misunderstand me, you don't need to be disabled like me, to create a top notch work-out, in fact I think any gym, or home gym, would be much improved, with the addition of Black Mountain Resistance Bands, and the work-out challenge that you get with these bands, are unmatched. In conclusion, let me say that they are a wonderful value at under $30.00, and I would recommend them to anyone looking to keep themselves in great shape. Today its up to each of us to keep ourselves as healthy as we can, and the Black Mountain Bands, will help you do that, in my opinion.

Anyway, I was very dissapointed at this iteration of the Nook.First off, the Nookcolor is very heavy.  I think it's almost 1 pound, and since it's not a true tablet, you're supposed to hold it in one hand, but it'll strain your hand muscles after a few minutes.  Even the B&N; guy told me to hold it with TWO hands. That's pretty pathetic, I must say. The only way to use it for more than a few minutes is to pop it up on some support, which obviously is not convenient for a device that's primarily an e-book reader.Second, even though it's much faster than 1st- and 2nd-generation Nooks, it is still slow, especially when browsing the web.  Now, page turns are generally faster, but there is no animation, and sometimes there *is* a slight delay so you're never sure if the device registered your turn gesture.  Very annoying.Third, the screen is high-res but rather poor in contrast and viewing angles.  I think the resolution is 1024x600, and the DPI is in the high 100's, but overall I felt the screen looked coarse.  I guess for this price, they have to pick some cheapo screen, so no surprise there.  The color LCD screen, of course, draws down battery pretty quick, a fact even the B&N; staff acknowledges readily.  Also, the screen is completely unreadable under direct sunlight.Speaking of the screen, the digitizer is not very responsive, whether you want to zoom in or out or type something.  It's slightly better than my 4th-gen iPod touch but that's still a very frustrating experience.Fourth, the software is still buggy.  The demo unit in store had a few books, but half of them could not open, with some mysterious error message.

I recommend it for a group of competitive players who enjoy some healthy tension and getting political.It is important to note that it has a rather high skill cap and is the type of game in which the more experienced players can win pretty easily. They will understand the most advantageous locations to seek as well as the best way to use or distribute the city council powers. Less experienced players will have a tough time making the most of their very limited resources.Half of the fun is in the real world politics (appropriate for the theme). Forming alliances, and sometimes breaking them, is sometimes necessary to take out whoever is in the lead. Fights for territories can not be avoided, and they often occur between ""alliances."" This constant conflict is by far the biggest reason why this game gets so tense. I get so nervous with each turn, that it can truly stress me out.In response to those who claim that the game is unbalanced and that it is impossible for one to ""bounce back"" after losing, I will admit that it is extremely difficult. However, it is certainly not impossible, and it does not mean that the ""loser"" will not have any fun. Let's not forget that in many of these types of games, the loser (or losers) is the one who has the power to DECIDE who the winner is by dedicating all resources to screwing someone over or pushing them to victory.

Keep in mind that what looks like the same game is actually quite different. Low stakes limit holdem is much different than high stakes limit holdem and no limit and pot limit are significantly different than limit holdem. And finally no limit cash is different than no limit tournament play. That said this book is excellent for pot limit and even more so for no limit mid to high buy in tournaments.A quick hint- the use of the word ""Championship"" in the McEvoy and Cloutier titles can and should be completely interchangeable with the word ""tournament"". That is the player these books are written for.Many of the super tight approaches that Cloutier uses to be successful in tournament play are unprofitable in cash game play. Because the average player is so ultra loose, tighter is probably better than looser but again this is geared primarily for tournaments where if you lose your chips you are through for the day.Survival is one of the most important ideas in tournament play but ultra tight in cash games will often get you too little action on your better hands. Overall a very good book for tournament play; Cloutier is a proven and durable winner and has much to teach the budding no limit holdem  tournament player in this book. Several now well-known winners have credited this book as ""the"" reason they won. Worth reading IMO.",4.0,you need to know what game you are playing,1131408000,"11 8, 2005",Sports_and_Outdoors,1.0,,

Never was able to get past the bare basics in high school language classes (German) and, despite the fact that both my parents were born and raised in Italy, I've never been able to get much traction in Italian either.The Rosetta Stone software, however, is making a difference. No, I can't say that after using the software for a week that I'm fluent in Italian, but I am making progress. It's a very comfortable way to learn the language, especially since it's self-paced and offers tools (the headset/microphone) to help out with pronunciation, a particular stumbling block for me. Since I'm so slow at picking up a language (and self-conscious about it), I'm finding this type of robust, immersive self-study to be far more effective than classroom learning.A minor nit to pick -- I wish the headset quality was a bit better since it's such an important tool in the process. It's adequate, but given the price tag for the product, better sound quality and usage comfort would be welcomed.This is only Level 1 Italian, so the language skills taught are just the basics. Think of it as a way to get your feet wet with a new language. If you're serious about becoming fluent in Italian or looking for more than just the ability to ""try on"" a new language, then you'll want to get the advanced versions (unfortunately, at a much higher cost).It is a very fun way to learn a language.

While there were things about the Kindle I really liked (features that other reviewers on the Kindle site had written), the one thing that made me choose the Nook was the ability to borrow and read ebooks from my local library. Haven't been back to the library since!Now here comes the Nook Simple Touch Reader (Nook STR). I got one via pre-order when they came out in early June.  It has the same e-ink Pearl screen as the Kindle, so the screen contrast is no longer an issue. And wow, has the user interface improved over the original Nook! (which I thought was clunky) The entire e-ink Pearl screen has full touchscreen capability. On both the Kindle and the original Nook, I felt myself wanting to touch the screen to select a book to read, instead of using the buttons (on the Kindle) or the LCD touchscreen (on the original Nook) to highlight and select the desired ebook. On the Nook STR, the Library screen shows icons for all the ebooks loaded in the device (both library and purchased). Touch the icon, and the ebook opens. Turning the page? Touch the screen on the right side of the page (to go forward) or the left side (to go back). Or swipe your finger across the screen as in flipping a physical book page. Or use the buttons built into the frame. Want to page quickly through a book? Hold down the page turning button. Need a word definition? Touch and hold on the word and a dictionary pops up. The user interface resembles that of an iPhone or iPad, with the icons, virtual keyboard and the physical home button. It even has the ""slide to unlock"" feature like the iPhone. The touchscreen on the Nook STR is infrared (it senses the heat of your finger, again like iPhone), so a light touch works just fine. I found that on the original Nook, sometimes it would take multiple touches on the LCD screen for the device to recognize a command.In response to the reviews about the touchscreen ceasing to respond, the pre-order Nook STR I had suffered from that problem.  The touchscreen would become slow to respond, and eventually quit working altogether.  A power cycle generally brought it back.  I started a thread on B&N;'s website about this and found many others having the problem.  I did take my Nook STR back to B&N; and they exchanged it.  Have had the replacement Nook ST for six weeks now and the problem hasn't returned.  So don't be spooked about buying one due to this problem - if it happens to you, exchange it.Going back to library books, I had to install Adobe Digital Editions onto my PC (my library had the link to download - free).  This software allows you to manage your ebooks on your Nook.The Nook STR is a good choice for seniors that may not have extensive computer skills.  Using the device is easy enough, but loading books from a library website (via Adobe Digital Editions) requires a few steps to complete.  If help is needed, it can be a positive relationship-building experience.One last plus - once you get your Nook STR, check the ""Shop"" tab to access B&Ns; website.  Every Friday B&N; offers a free book for download, and has discounts on other days of the week.",5.0,Simple (To Use) Touch Reader,1311465600,"07 24, 2011",Electronics,1.0,,

I've had it for a few weeks now and found that it's more than a protractor. You can draw any circle up to 12 3/4"" in 32""nds. One thing you'll need is something for a pivot point when drawing circles. The best thing I found for that was a straight pin from my wife's pin cushion. It fits perfectly in the holes and if you have an extra  0.5 pencil, cut the head off the pin and it will fit in the pencil. Giving you a handy pivot tool with a retractable point. You just can't use a lot of pressure when making your circle. One thing I have found that works quite well when drawing circles on paper is a piece of 1/2"" cork board. Just use a straight pin, to pin the protractor and paper in position.You can search ""Straight pins for sewing"" and ""Cork boards"" right here at Amazon.Also you can use it to find the center of whatever your working on. If it's greater than the width of the protractor.

Then when you lay down that objective tile, the adventure rules tells you what happens (usually a boss battle).The game comes with 13 adventures, but it's super easy to make your own. Or if you just want to kill some monsters, throw a chamber tile in your dungeon tile deck and when you explore to that chamber tile, draw a chamber card to see what happens.The components all seem very high quality.

I'm very happy with it.  In particular:- The band ends swivel to prevent twisting or binding.- The grip rotates as well, making for very smooth motion when doing standing curls, tricep kickbacks, or any other motion more complex than a straight pull.- The clips and stacking hardware are very high quality, and the stackable nature of the bands (can work with one, two, three, or more different bands at once) allows me to get a lot of variety in resistance from low resistance for tricep work all the way up to very high resistance for pull-downs.- Door hardware works great.- One set of handles and a pile of bands packs a little tighter than a set where each band has its own handles.Minor downsides to be aware of:- the stacking hardware can be problematic (scrape you) if trying to do exercises where you draw the band across your body such as overhead tricep extensions.  Usually just means adjusting your technique a bit.- When using stacked bands it can be harder to vary length by stepping on a loop of the band.  Just something to be aware of, but by no means a big problem.Would enthusiastically recommend.",5.0,Great for hotel workouts,1342828800,"07 21, 2012",Sports_and_Outdoors,1.0,,

Sadly, I did not discover this until after purchasing and trying the C-String.My wife and I were celebrating our 5th anniversary and I wanted to do something special to surprise her after dinner. I figured that we would have plenty of time that evening as my custom is to spend $1 per year that we've been together on each of our meals and that price point doesn't lend itself to multiple courses.I quickly discovered the C-String while doing alphabetical research on ""exciting underwear"" and I immediately ordered one. Between its exciting novelty and presumed ease of removal (more on this later), I was sure that my wife would feel like the luckiest girl in the world and that this would translate to an exciting evening.3-5 business days later, on our anniversary, I received a discrete brown box with a smile on the outside and giddily ran it upstairs to the bathroom where I could lock the door and be alone. Immediately, I wished that I had brought my computer with me as the product came without instructions and ""installation"" was not turning out to be intuitive. Without an online resource to guide me, I was forced to experiment.As it happens, and completely by accident, my first attempt ended up being correct (in terms of orientation), but I didn't realize it because of the awkward result that the C-String had in parting the company of certain anatomical neighbors for which distance is a source of pain. Plus, the C-String kept slipping down in a way that, from the back, probably resembled a video tape being ejected from a VCR.I tried reversing the garment. This solved the problem of parted anatomy in the front, but created a similar (and similarly painful) issue in the back. I found that squatting and bending forward alleviated some of the pain, but decided that maintaining this position for the entirety of our anniversary celebration, might clue my wife into the the surprise that lay in store for her, thus threatening the full force of its impact and the excitement that would be derived therefrom.Next, I tried wearing donning the C-String in a horizontal, rather than vertical configuration - with the band going around my hip. Initially, I found no discomfort, but as I stood there admiring my ingenuity in the mirror, I realized that something wasn't right. Imagine a pirate with his eyepatch covering his ear instead of his eye and you'll have a pretty good idea of what was going wrong for me.Again, my thoughts wandered to my computer but I could hear movement outside the door and knew that unless I wanted to risk discovery, I was on my own. I studied the C-String intently for a while and decided that the skinny end must go in back. The pain, I decided, I could handle, but how could I prevent it from slipping down? Then it hit me: Maybe the skinny bit at the back wasn't supposed to remain external (if you know what I mean).What happened next is something that I won't share, but it involved deep questions about my level of love and commitment to my wife, a small container of Vaseline, some blood, and some tears. I decided to hide the C-String and come back to it after I had found a computer and an ice pack.Sadly, I did not have time to consult my computer or experiment any further before the time came to depart for the restaurant. Not wanting to waste the C-String, I adjusted the frame ever-so-slightly and told my wife that it was a Google Glass that I was going to use to record our date. Happily, she believed me and was thrilled at the idea. Sadly, she shared my plans with the woman who took our order at the restaurant and we were immediately asked to leave.On the plus side, I didn't have to explain why I didn't have any video of our evening. 2 Stars.",2.0,Warning: Product is not for Men,1403395200,"06 22, 2014",Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,0.0,,

I have been wanting an I-Pad for scrolling the internet, checking e-mails, etc, but it seemed very bulky, heavy and I was not going to spend $600.  So I saw the Nook Color in Best Buy and felt it wasn't really that heavy.  It is about the size and weight of a paperback.  It's also about 1/2 the price of an I-Pad so I did some research and found out that one can scroll the internet, check e-mails, play music (but I have an I-Pod so I won't really be using that feature), read books and magazines.  Here are some of the features that I like best:{1} Books-Books are very easy to read on the Nook Color.  You can make the font larger or smaller, reduce the backlight (which helps to conserve the battery) You can also highlight the text (and ""highlight a highlight"" which makes the highlight darker as if you were highlighting on a paperback book). You can also share certain passages with friends via Facebook (but you must be within Wi-Fi to use this feature).You can also look up words with the built-in dictionary and makes notes in the text.{2} Magazines-Magazines on the Nook Color look just like they do on the newsstand. The magazines are complete with all the ""ads"" and articles. You can also use ""article view"" in which you can select the article you want to read instead of reading the whole magazine.  Most magazines start with a free 14-day trial and then you are billed monthly until you cancel the subscription.  Canceling subscriptions is not that hard to do.{3} Library- You can customize your Library to look the way you want it to.  You can have shelves with all your classic books together, all your magazines together, your romance books together, your comedy books together and so on.{4} Lend Me- Lend me is like a ""Book Swap"".  If you have friends or relatives that have a Nook Color you can ""lend"" each other books.  You start off by requesting a book to ""borrow"".  When they approve the ""borrow"" the book will appear in your Library for a period of say 14 days. After the ""borrowing time"" is up the book is automatically returned to the library of the person who lent it out.{5} Nook Friends- Nook friends is like your little book club.  You can lend books and suggest books to each other.  If no one has a Nook Color that you know you can also go online and find some friends.{6} Applications- The Nook Color also has certain applications that you can download.  You can get games (like ANGRY BIRDS-my personal favorite, MahJong, Solitaire & Tangrams),Epicurious, apps to organize yourself, and many others.  The selection is very limited but they will add more in the future.{7} Personalization- You can personalize your Nook Color to look unique. You can set a personal photograph to be the background when you turn on your Nook.{8} Purchasing Books- Books are very reasonable priced for the NC.  There are books as cheap as $5 and even FREE.  They are adding new free books every week. You can also read any e-book up to an hour for free at any Barnes & Noble store. The Barnes and Noble cafe (i.e. Starbucks) will also send offers to you via your NC (although I haven't receieved any as of yet). Once you purchase books downloading is actually very fast. I actually downloaded three books in a matter of six minutes.  They also recommend books based on ones that you already own.  The books you purchase are yours forever, so if you purchase another NC you will have the books you have now,  you can also read your library on your PC, your smartphone (by downloading the ""Nook App""){9}Battery Life- My battery has lasted about four days if I'm just reading.  But when you play games it will probably last about two days.  The charger has an ""n"" on it that stays orange when it is charging and once the battery is charged it turns green.  It was about half charged out the box.  You can use the NC while charging but the screen is very sensitive.  If the battery is completely drained it takes about three hours to completely charge.{10} Virtual Bookmark- You used to have mark the page you were last reading yourself.  But not with the NC.  It has a ""virtual"" bookmark.  So when you start reading a book,then you have to put the NC down or turn it off for the night it will ""save"" your place automatically.  Then when you want to resume reading you can start back at the point you were before you turned off the NC.  You can start reading by touching the ""book"" icon on the NC (bottom left-it looks like an open book) from anywhere.  So if you are reading a magazine, and want to read the last book you were reading just tap the book icon and your book is opened to the point where you left off.  You can also choose any book in your library and it will open them where you left off.{11}Home Screen - You can personalize the home screen to look any way you like. You can upload pictures or use the ones pre-set to use your background.  So two NC's can never look alike.  You can make your NC as unique as you are.There are other features as well.  So in conclusion, the NC is a very good tablet for about half the price of the I-Pad. But I do recommend getting a cover for it since it will get smeared or scratched if you don't. If I need to take a break my very hectic life I just grab my Nook Color and my I-Pod,put on some very relaxing music and I am instantly transported into my own imaginary world. This is perfect for long car trips. This is one of the best ""me"" gifts in a long time.

There are several different strategies that you can use.  You can play defense and try to obstruct your opponent, or ignore your opponent all together and just focus on getting points. You can try to string together as many short runs as possible, or go for one long run.The other beauty of this game is that it can be played by two players or more, and is just as fun.

I LOVE the game.  Up until this year, though, I was horribly inconsistent at it.  So much so that I was often embarrassed to go out and play in club outings, tournaments, etc.  I would come home so down on myself.  I said I was going to quit so many times.This year things changed.  I was sitting at a party and this guy started boring me about this book he read and how it changed his game.

I have spent $100's or even $1,000's of dollars on golf lessons over the years and NONE of them came even 1/2 way to what this book has done for me (golf pros should be ashamed at themselves!  They make you do these goofy things and they don't focus on the fundamentals).  I read it three times in about a day and a half.  The third time I read it with my club by my side (to try grips, etc.).  The biggest breakthroughs for me were the grip (I had been doing it totally wrong for years) and the pattern of the on-plane arms, shoulders hips backswing to the hips, shoulders arms forward swing.  Again, unbelievable!  I hit it straighter, farther, etc. etc.  It is so much fun!  I feel like I actually know how to play the game!  And when I start to go off kilter a little bit, I go back to Hogan's fundamentals and it all comes back.

Further the help bonuses stack, so it's possible (and even automatic) to take out very high level enemies.The poor durability score is due to the plastic holder in the box being already cracked right after unwrapping it.

I've gone through my share of MP3 players, minidisc players, walkmans and discmans, but so far nothing has had the versatility that the Nomad Jukebox has. My problem is that whenever I travel I insist that I can't survive without bringing my entire CD collection, and it's annoying (and risky) to lug around that many CDs. Minidiscs provided a solution for a while, but it was to much hassle to spend so much time recording &amp; editing the minidiscs manually without the help of a computer program. MP3 players like the Rio 500 &amp; Nomad II are great for day use &amp; jogging, but most of the time 1 hour just doesn't cut it. MP3-CD players don't seem worth it to me because you still have to buy a CD burner &amp; carry around CDs. The Nomad Jukebox is for people who want a MASSIVE amount of music (6 GIGs, 100+ hours, which is 100x more than most Mp3 players, at around the same price) for use over a long period of time or at home.The Jukebox comes bundled with software for PlayCenter 2 (for the PC) or SoundJam (for Macs) to use for ripping CDs &amp; Mp3s from your computer to the Jukebox. It also comes with decent headphones (loudness is NOT a problem) &amp; a carrying case, plus all the necessary equipment for setting it up. Setup is pretty easy, and using the software is a lot more intuitive than I though it would be. It takes me around 5 minutes to rip a CD from my computer the the Nomad. The best feature by far is the OMD description searcher-- if you're online while your ripping CDs, the OMD finds the album name, year released, genre, artist, &amp; ALL the track names, so you don't have to type anything in. You can also rip Mp3s from the Nomad back to your computer. The songs in the Nomad can be categorized under Albums, Artists, Genres or Play Lists to make it easier to navigate. It supports data, mp3, wma, and wav files (plus many others). You can download updates [from the web] for better software or firmware for the player, so even if something isn't perfect now, in the future improvements will be available. The player also has an infrared port on the front for future additions (like a remote control). It comes with 2 hours of free music (mostly classical) and some Audio Books. It includes jacks for line-in recording from radios, microphones or stereos,  and line-out hookup to stereos or speakers.Of course, the Nomad Jukebox is a very new kind of Mp3 player, so it has a few MAJOR flaws:1) BATTERY POWER- Hard Drives tend to suck up an endless amount of power, and that's exactly what the Jukebox is-- a Hard Drive disguised as an Mp3 player. You can ONLY use the 4 rechargeable batteries that Nomad gives you (AA size) to run it without the AC adapter, and those only last around 2 hours by themselves. Nomad includes an extra set of 4 to replace them, but you always have to make sure they are fully charged. Maybe in the future there will be more options (battery pack?)2) WEIGHT - It's around the size of a first-generation CD player, and it weighs around 2 lbs with batteries. This isn't really a problem for me, but it depends what you want to use it for. It's not meant for use while jogging or biking, etc-- it's more for use over a long period of time away from home, on the bus/plane/dorm/in the car, or at home, plugged into the AC adapter and a pair of speakers. Besides the weight, in my opinion, it looks VERY nice- it has unique, smooth design, coloring and shape (and the LCD screen is easy to read).The Nomad Jukebox is the best in its category of high-capacity Mp3 players-- It holds 100 times more music than a normal Mp3 player, and its price has been drastically reduced, making it a lot more affordable than it was before. Overall, I am very satisfied with it. It is the best option for anyone who's ever wished they could bring all their CDs with them without actually having to CARRY them... and I think that I will be using it for a long, long time from now.",4.0,Nomad Jukebox - the best Mp3 player as of now...,988416000,"04 28, 2001",Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,1.0,,

I tried the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 (expensive and glitchy), the Lenvovo Idea Tab (poor performance) before I settled on the Nook. After using tablets at both high and low-end price points I figured I had nothing to lose--and was pleasantly surprised by the Nook's capabilities!On the Nook I can read BN or Kindle books, play Scrabble from the Android store, and watch Netflix. More advanced features such as GPS and camera are unnecessary for me, and I enjoy the simplicity of this device. It has a sturdy build and even though I did not want a white tablet (fear of dirt) it has not been an issue. I have had it for several months and don't feel anxious about using it without a cover.It's ease of use, clean interface, adequate battery life, and features make this a winner for me in the under $100 category. Add to that BN's 1-year warranty and I am more than satisfied with my purchase.My only qualm with the Nook HD is that it has a proprietary charging cable (not a micro usb like cell phones) so it is an extra cord to carry when traveling. In addition, it will not fit just any usb plug (something to do with wattage, I think). So if you plug the usb end into a travel charger or car charger it may not work.

I've had a chance to play it a few times now, so here's what I've seen:VERY HIGH LEVEL IF YOU DON'T REALLY KNOW GAMES LIKE THISThis is a worker-placement game made by a famous game designer, Uwe Rosenberg.  He has made some extremely well-liked games in the past, and this takes pieces of all of them and puts them all together into this one.  It's a very complex games with a lot of moving parts, options, and time taken (probably around 3 hours).  If you'd like a good idea of the type of game this is, take a look at Agricola and Le Havre.IF YOU KNOW UWE'S GAMESYou're not going to see a ton of originality here.  This almost feels like Uwe took Agricola: All Creatures Big and Small and blew it up 50x.  It's physically a much larger game, a much longer game, a ton more options.COMPONENTSIt's fairly standard fair for Uwe's games.  The pieces are all perfectly sturdy.  The art is OK, but nothing spectacular.  I have two gripes, and that is for the color-blind.  Two of the colors people can play as, blue and.....I guess it's blue-green, are FAR too similar in color, and I really can't see the difference unless they're right next to each other (I'm not very color-blind, but just have trouble telling very similar colors apart unless they're right next to each other).  I had to veto anyone playing as blue-green or else I couldn't tell the difference.  There are arrows on the game-board which indicate that you're supposed to restock those spaces, and some of them end up blending into the art behind them since it's a similar color as well.  We missed restocking a few spaces a few times because of this.The game spaces themselves have an issue where the art indicating what to do on a space can sometimes be VERY small and difficult to read unless you get close.  That issue is even worse with the buildings you can purchase, as they are all fairly small and there is not a good way to see them unless you're right next to them.  Cheat sheets are required to see what is out there, but then of course since there is only one of most buildings, you then need to still check to see what has been purchased.GAMEPLAYIt's mostly standard Agricola fair: you take turns placing workers which let you gather resources, spend those resources to buy buildings, expand your farm/cave, grow your family (more workers), and/or get more animals or vegetables.  The changes:-There isn't a harvest every few rounds, there's a harvest nearly every round.  To make up for it, getting food is a good deal easier than Agricola and the penalty for not feeding isn't nearly as high (it's less points penalized, and you score generally well over double the points in this game than Agricola).-On the flipside, it seems like there are less VERY good ways to get food.  In Agricola, getting a &#34;food engine&#34; going where you can turn single animals/grain into 4-5 food with few if any actions takes the pressure off of feeding.  In this, there are less &#34;engine pieces&#34; for feeding, so getting things breeding and sowed is about the best you can do for regular feeding.-It's far easier to get places to put animals and far easier to sow grain and veggies than Agricola.  It's also worth far more points to have lots of both, than in Agricola.-It's far less important to grow your family quickly, and since you have so many fewer actions to get resources early on without worrying about feeding, it feels like it is much tougher to get the resources to grow your family.-Adventuring.  You can send your workers out with weapons to get things and level up.  The higher the level, the better the things you can get.  It's a very interesting concept and a very different way to get resources.-If someone takes a spot you really want, you can pay some food to just copy it.  So there's less &#34;blocking&#34; and in that sense, interaction in this game than Agricola.-Last, but not least, there are buildings.  Boy are there buildings.  There's dwellings (generally used so you can grow your family), there are green buildings which mostly make things cheaper and/or give you more resources, and then there are yellow buildings which generally give you points.  These all replace the Improvements and Occupations from Agricola.  All of them are available each game and all are available right from the start.THE FEEL OF THE GAMEAs you can see from above, there are some fairly drastic changes from Agricola.  How does it play?  Well, for starters, the buildings are a bit daunting.  There are a ton of them, none are EXTREMELY expensive and most of them are unique, so you realistically need to figure out what path you're taking very early on.  For experienced players, that shouldn't be a problem.  For the inexperienced, it's a TON to take in.Unlike Agricola, there is no hidden information between players.  The round cards come out in a slightly random order, almost exactly like Agricola, but that is the only change from game to game.  For some, that's a positive, as there are many different strategies, all of which are viable in every game.  For some, that's a negative, as each game doesn't feel as &#34;customized&#34; as Agricola, where one game might make sense for you to go one strategy based on the cards you have, and the next a completely different one.In Agricola, other than when cards push you in a different direction, there is a certain flow of what you want to do in most games.  Early, you want to expand your home, grow your family, and get a food engine going.  Mid-game, continue to grow and start to get renovating, animals, vegetables, and fill out your farm with fields and pastures.  Late-game, you want to finish filling out what you haven't done yet and eek out the last points you can get.On the flip-side, there isn't an immediately &#34;best&#34; way to go in Caverna.  Instead, the dominant strategy seems to be going in a direction which no one else is.  If everyone is going for Adventuring, then you can be freed up for farming.  If everyone is filling out spaces on their farm, then you can be freed up for filling up your cave.  The path of least resistance is the path to victory.  Is that more fun?  That is up to you.  But it is a VERY different feel than Agricola.CONCLUSIONSo, is it better than Agricola?  It's hard to say.  I hated Agricola the first time I played it, then liked it a bit more each time, until it became one of my favorites.  Right now, I think I need to play Caverna at least another couple of times to really get a feel for it.My snap judgement is that this is a good game, but not as good as Agricola.  I personally like a game with a bit of hidden information.  I miss the Occupations/Minor Improvements as a mechanism to push you in a direction no one else wants to go.  I miss the fact that every turn, there is a fight over certain resources.  I miss being able to actually block other people.  When playing Caverna, I find myself not so much caring what people are doing on an action-to-action basis, just what they are doing overall, so the game feels a bit less interactive.  And finally, I really miss the fact that even if I do an awesome job with my strategy, it doesn't stop people from doing just as awesome, if not more awesome at another strategy and winning.If you're a fan of Uwe's other games, this is definitely worth a try, but with the hefty price tag, it might be worth trying a friend's copy first and seeing what you think before jumping in head-first.",3.0,"Caverna, the greatest thing since sliced bread?

I've written an extensive session report on how to use Twilight Struggle in the classroom based on a class project a few years back and have been as outspoken as possible every where I can to pursue the use of other good games for the same reason. Perhaps because of this, a while ago I was approached by the makers of this game to play and review it.(I did receive a complimentary copy to do so)This is my first board game review, so please bear with me. In order to do so, I wanted to take advantage of playing with the target audience of the game--my 17 1/2 year old nephew who's a good kid, does well in school, but is very apathetic about pretty much everything, including getting ready and applied to college.Components: The game comes in a fairly small, compact box and has good quality card stock cards. The artwork and colors are very utilitarian and have a good education look that is nice and I enjoy it. You will need a bunch of paper clips on hand as these are used to track info on the cards. I'd recommend plastic or coated ones so as not to scrape up the cards any as you slide them up and down.The Basic Premise: The goal of Application Crunch is just that, to show high school students the process of how to apply to college in a way that makes sense, is fun and interesting. It's played over a series of rounds using cards and action points in a variety of ways to track the progress of the players in multiple facets of their high school life and 'sending' those trackers off to achieve different rewards, ultimately resulting in applying and hopefully being accepted at the type of college you believe will bring you the most victory points.How it Works: To start, everyone draws a character card, a family finances card and two envelopes. Each character has a special ability to give them a slight leg up in different aspects of the game. Each player in turn draws a productivity card telling them how many action points they get along with some fun, light flavor text in the mood of a typical HS kid's week. The player then uses those action points to either draw cards, move up a level on the cards they already have, or add cards to your envelopes and/or add the envelopes to an event or college (thus 'applying' to that school).The cards are divided into extracurricular, academics, work, and service along with question cards which work a little differently. Each of these activities have levels and theme appropriate names that provide benefits for achieving them. The higher up, the better and more versatile--more cash, awards, etc. This is where the paper clips are used to track that information. The question cards are drawn and asked by the active player. These are open ended trivia-type questions about getting ready for college and/or applying. A few answers are on each card but I'd say it's pretty much up to the group which are best and who should get the rewards, usually a free level up.After all players have taken all their actions, a new event or college is put into play to be applied to and the last one in the line is set aside. Those whose envelopes were submitted to that event/college are opened and its determined who were admitted and/or given other awards.Once all events/colleges have gone through this process, the game is over and you determine who won. You have to have enough money to go to the college you end up selecting that you got into. Each college gives you victory points according to the different icons you achieved and which school you went to. So, a technical school will give you more points for awards in engineering and science while a private school will emphasize high grades.Whoever has the most points is the winner.My take: The game was surprisingly cohesive and enjoyable and my nephew felt the same way. You learn much about the application process and what it entails to get into the college of your choice. The game is fairly quick and simple but has many interesting decisions to make. I liked how it showed how you need to balance your life between, academics, work and extracurricular activities. The trivia cards are great, too, as they can start good discussions about what to expect and what needs to be done. However, I do think they would work much better with 3-4 players. The icons were easy to read and the rules are fairly easy to follow. The end game scoring is a bit of math, but that's good anyway, right?Overall, Application Crunch is a well designed game that achieves its purpose in that it is both informative/educational and fun to play. My nephew and I both agree that it would not be our first, second or third choice to play off the game shelf as it really isn't that kind of fun. However, to be used for its intended purpose, it gets high marks. I'd highly recommend it to any and every education counselor (or any youth counselor, really), ecclesiastic leader, teacher or any friend or relative concerned with the prospects of their family members in high school.",4.0,"Educating in a Non-boring way (Yes, it's fun AND useful!)",1332288000,"03 21, 2012",Toys_and_Games,1.0,,

The first thing I noticed about the camera was how good the pictures were, and I mean really nice pics.  They were clear and crisp and the colors were fantastic, eat your heart out Kodachrome.  The second thing I noticed was how long the  included rechargeable battery life was.  It was more than a month before I had to charge the battery and that month included my vacation time.  I bought a second battery of course, but that was the boy scout in me, I never had to use it to this day.  It is a bit chunky compared to the models out today, but if you want to take really great pics it's a breeze.  No buttons or menus to fuss with, just set it to automatic. If you like to fine tune there are plenty of features hidden there for the more demanding photographers.  In camera red eye reduction is avialable, as is aperture priority, shutter priority and white balance.  You can also force the flash to fire when the subjects have intense lighting behind them so that you can actually see their faces (flash fill).  In addition there is a ""my settings"" menu option where you can preset all of your desired custom settings for taking pictures.  It also has something missing in most of today's cams, a viewfinder.  Did you ever try to take a picture looking at an LCD screen in bright sunlight?  For [...] bucks this camera is a steal.",5.0,5 Years and Still Going Strong,1242432000,"05 16, 2009",Electronics,1.0,,

Wrath of Ashardalon streamlines the entire process, simplifies the rules, and makes the game mechanics very clear.  Although I did need to look up a few rules clarifications on a couple of FAQs, it was easy to dive right in with a couple of friends and start playing immediately.I can completely understand why veteran D&D; players might be disappointed with this game, but I would propose that a veteran player could simply change the rules and add in whatever elements from the core D&D; rulebook he or she wanted to use (including a DM) and simply treat this as a dungeon building/scenario pack with options for streamlining where desired.  That's my plan at least as I have a fun time using this game to ease myself into full-blown D&D; at my own pace.I'm more of a video game player, and to use an example from the video game world, take the classic game Civilization and its sequels.  You could play a full game that could take more than one day to finish, and sure it was a lot of fun.  However, Civilization Revolutions was later released as a streamlined, faster paced version of the classic, and I really enjoyed it as much as the original because sometimes I just didn't feel like committing many hours to a single game.  My impression is that Wrath of Ashardalon is to D&D; as Civilization Revolutions is to Civilization.  One key difference of course is that you can adjust the amount of streamlining in Wrath of Ashardalon to make it as involved or not as a full-blown D&D; adventure based on your personal preference.",5.0,fun game,1306195200,"05 24, 2011",Toys_and_Games,1.0,,

It worked pretty well but I never got over wondering if washing and drying five different parts each day was really worth it.  Well, in the end I had no choice but to get rid of it, because the rubber tube inside the machine that brought the heated water from below the burner plate to the top of the unit developed a crack and leaked water onto an interior electrical connection, which caused the wire to the burner plate to overheat and burn out.  When this happened the machine made a loud ""pop"" noise, which was followed by this awful metallic burned smell that one always associates with electrical fires. I went out to the kitchen to find my counter flooded with warm water (not hot, mind you: the machine never got the water hot enough), and the plastic around the hot plate melted to the point that the hot plate was sinking.  I called Cuisinart to report the problem as a concerned consumer and all the company seemed to care about was whether the machine was under warranty, which of course it wasn't.

These companies love to blame consumers for stupidity or negligence, but this is how they respond when you report a problem out of common courtesy!Learn from me and do not buy this machine!  I subsequently purchased a Melitta Mill & Brew, which costs a little more but is far superior in quality and design.

I have seen the N2A (Nook2Android) SD cards here on Amazon and wanted him to have that functionality but didn't want to pay that much for one, so I did some googling and figured out how to make one myself. I purchased a 16GB micro SD card and in about an hour and a half, had the thing booting to CM7 from the SD card, and now it has full tablet functionality. It runs AWESOME, super smooth and very responsive, full tablet capabilities including running 3rd party apps and access to the google play store, and all without rooting or voiding the warranty. All he has to do to put it back to stock is remove the SD card (which he never does! It is pretty much useless in its stock form unless you only do light web browsing and read ebooks) My husband LOVES it and couldn't be happier with it. He uses it every day. The only thing it doesn't have that I consider a negative is a camera. MY tablet (Acer Picasso) has a camera and I do actually use it quite a bit, but my husband says he wouldn't use one  on a tablet so it doesn't bother him anyway.

I started out with the Gerber slide out milti-tool.  It was great but I would have to open the plier to use the Knife or any other tool, plus it had a bad tendency to slip off what ever I was tightening and pinch my palm.  I also tried the Sog Multi tool and it has a great plier, but I found the tools did not compare to the Swiss-tool.  What I like about the Swiss-tool is the easy of access of all the tools, Knifes, phillips and straight screwdrivers, file, chisel, ect.  The 9"" ruler is a great tool that I use frequently.  The only reason that I gave it 4 stars is that on my old swiss tool the blade lockout is showing fatigue.

Very high quality bands, I've used them inside (70 degrees) and outside (50 degrees) and they've held up in both places. All of the handles, clips, nylon straps, and other parts of the band are in excellent condition. Further, even though these bands are automotive-grade, they rubber is virtually odor free, and this isn't the case with all exercise bands.It's a nice plus to these bands that the handles detach. It adds more variability and flexibility as to what one can do with the bands. Also, the bands are indeed the resistance weights that are advertised, and I have found that they offer plenty of resistance. I'm an avid athlete who is just a year out of playing at the collegiate level, I know my way around a gym,  and I use free weights, 5lb-45lb. These bands completely cover that, they are very light-weight and easily transportable, and if you want to start using bands or are looking for a durable set, these are the ones. (Note: resistance bands are known for providing strength training that increases muscle tone, range of motion, and flexibility. They are great for providing functional workouts, and they can be used for building some muscle size, but if you're a bigger guy wanting to get bulked, resistance bands may not be for you. For anyone else, they do the trick and can't be beat for convenience.)Saber is a good company, they're a family-owned business, and when you call them, you don't get an answering machine, automatic response, or a customer service rep who doesn't care, you get the owner.

The finished puzzle is 22"" x 22"" and it has 25 pieces that go together easily.  The pieces are sturdy cardboard with glossy stock on both sides so they can be wiped with a damp cloth.This puzzle is most appropriate for older toddlers and up who won't chew on the cardboard although they may need a little help from an older sibling or parent.  It provides a good learning experience before visiting a real zoo and offers the opportunity to teach not only animal names but the sounds they make, colors, counting, and the alphabet.The storage box is almost as much fun to play with as the puzzle itself.  It has a rope handle and and easy-open tab.

In the second you gaze at a candle (or a special lamp with blue, stroposcobic light), kind of tratak, while the third phase is latihan, standing up and letting the body move freely in slow, organic movements.In the fourth you lie down with closed eyes, leaving the everyday mind and its chatter behind and opening up for a meeting with deeper parts of yourself.Gourishankar is the Indian name for Mt.Everest, and it's said, that if you do the breathing in the first phase optimally, you will be as high as this mountain (havn't experienced that I have to say, but still hoping that someday...).This enhanced version has a videosegment helping the beginner to the best possible start (and of course instructions in the booklet).",5.0,A beautiful evening meditation,1187827200,"08 23, 2007",Sports_and_Outdoors,1.0,,

It took 4 of my students working together to build this set about an hour. I only had to step in to break up any arguments. The youngest engineers were 7. There was one 8 year old, and the oldest was 11. It is possible for children to do.As for the educational aspect, it is great for logical thinking and scientific experimentation. Once children start building their own creations, and yes it is possible, they start exploring the science of ""what if"", as in ""what if I move this piece higher"" or ""what if I change this angle"". Of course parents and educators sometimes need to supply the terminology and maybe an idea or two to move things along.Last on the educational theme, paired with other household or classroom objects this becomes a great way to introduce children to Rube Goldberg and making new inventions. Go ahead and Google him, I'll wait.My point with this review is you cannot to sit back and be a spectator with any educational toy. It does require some parent involvement.

At last check they now have 366 apps and growing, most are kid stuff and games but do have some useful apps for weather, calendar, note taking, Flight checker, etc.  I can transfer Word, Excel, photos and music to it and learn more each time I mess with it.The one thing missing was a 3G capability of the black n white version.  Both 3G and Bluetooth are built into the guts but who knows if and when they will be turned on.  My solution is Virgin Mobiles Broadband2Go MiFi wireless that supports up to 5 connections.  You can use it for as little as 10 bucks for 10 days or 20 bucks for a month and more options.

I found batteries would easily last past 5 years, wouldn't be surprised if they lasted beyond 10 years, and it never was inaccurate for time.The screen is very easy to read in whatever light, direct sunlight through to pitch black (with the backlight). The backlight provides very even lighting. It's also extremely light weight and thin, which is a nice change from a lot of watches with similar feature sets that look like they were carved from a block of rubber.I'm looking to replace it with this one again simply because after that many years the buttons became very hard to press and the glass became so scratched that it is difficult to view the screen. I consider this acceptable though after that many years.The biggest drawback would be the strap, as I'm not a fan of Velcro.

I thought the Nook would be a great gift for her, after reading reviews here on Amazon that it can download and read free ebooks from library sites. Our local library offers ebooks so I thought it would be great.After getting the Nook, I learned a number of things:1. The Nook does NOT have a browser. It can only connect to the Barnes and Noble online bookstore.2. You are REQUIRED to have a valid credit card, even to download free content.3. While there is a way to root (hack) the Nook and thus enable a functional browser, it voids the warranty and is way too complicated to follow. I shouldn't have to hack a device to enable such a basic functionality.My mother isn't very computer savvy, and doesn't own a credit card, so I couldn't give her something like this. If it let you connect to library sites and download library books for free, it would be an ideal ereader. In it's current form, it's an overly-complicated money sinkhole.

Two Johnny Mathis albums for less than what we pay for the new stuff. Someone at Sony marketing has definitely dropped the ball on this album. Why it is so difficult to find is beyond me. This is nowhere near the usual one hit plus twenty cut outs or ""B"" sides you usually get in one of these twofers. This album set hits the spot like a ""balmy breeze on a night in May"" or ""like a cool mint julip on summer day."" Johnny Mathis ""hits a new high in my estimation."" In a word everything about this collection is Superb. The voice,the music,the arrangements,the style. Superb.Superb.Superb.Superb. To be sure there are a couple of old chestnuts in here with Moon in June type intros and all, but Mathis makes them new,I mean new today,2005 new. Please do not forget that these albums are over forty years old and some of the songs are SIXTY and SEVENTY years old but we're still talking about them! Resist, if you can, singing along with ""Sweet Lorraine"",""You Hit the Spot"",""Like Someone In Love"",""This Heart of Mine"" or my fave up tempo tune,""Can't Get Out of This Mood."" I sing along to some songs I've never liked,(I'm an old Doo Wop rock and roll guy.) nor can I sing a lick...but then Mathis makes us all think we can sing, doesn't he? Resist the urge to get up and waltz around to ""While We're Young.""(This aint' your father's Nelson Eddy stuff.) Listen to how he moves up and down the register, from high ""Irish Tenor"" like to mid baritone, effortlessly, flawlessly. Hell,the guy isn't singing, he is playing his voice as though a Stradivarius. ""I'm Glad There Is You"" may induce chills in some. Listen to the other ballads like ""By Myself"" and ""Then I'll Be Tired of You"". Some think he sometimes imitates others; He doesn't imitate,he pays homage to those that came before him. Does the last sentence in ""My One and Only Love"" sound a little ""Sassie""? ""I'm Glad There is You,"" and ""There Goes My Heart"" are superb demos of smooth and easy. Finally, I could wax on and on, but in my humble opinion the best of the best is the title song, ""Warm"".This number alone is worth the price of admission. Where has this song been? I've never heard it before. This is a beautiful ballad right out of the fifties, early sixties;It sounds like a title song from a movie ala ""The Best of Everything"" and Mr. Mathis let's it all out here. Again Music,style,voice, it just doesn't get any better than this. Listen to this ballad with your ""other"" and Fall In Love All Over Again! Pick up more than one copy because your friends will want it. I sure hope Johnny Mathis is still making royalties on these two albums because this is what MUSIC is supposed to be.

Chaika ""book, movie, tech lover""","[16, 20]","I have been down and up with this reader for the past 5 months, but since April, it has been a joy.  B&N; has gotten its act together.  The problem I had with not being able to open books has been solved. B&N; not only finally found out what caused some books to lock up but also how to restore them.  There is no longer any problem with opening any books.When I first bought my reader, the tech support people were not well-trained. They are now.  I have 80 books on it and no problems with any of them.Now, the goodies:  B&N; just introduced Enhanced Editions of some books. These have videos, audio clips, animated maps, etc.embedded in the text.  It's wonderful.  I'm reading D-Day, and throughout there are newsreel segments pertinent to the text.  For instance, you read about Eisenhower and then play the video of him talking to his troops before they embark for the Normandy Coast.  You don't just read about bombing or fighting,you hear and see as well. It's a whole new reading experience and available only on the NOOKcolor (or the iPad with the NOOK app.)Pictures in magazines like National Geographic are gorgeous.  They look better than the print versions. There is a selection of apps for the NOOKcolor, with more coming out all the time.However, if you want all the Android apps, then  you can get an N2A SD card on Amazon that turns your NOOKcolor into a full Android tablet with access to the Market. You then  have the option of booting the reader up as a NOOKcolor or an Android Tablet.  You can even get a Kindle App so you can get and read books from Kindle on your NOOKcolor.Some people say that the backlit screen has glare and that you can't read it outdoors.  Not true.  I read my NOOKcolor in my sunny back yard all the time, and, although I'm a 76 year old lady, I can read for hours on it with no problem.Now for the goodies besides the Enhanced Editions.  You can get an app that allows you to work on Office documents on your reader.  Downloading files, pictures, and music is a breeze.The NOOK also allows you to borrow ebooks from public libraries.  All you need is a library card.  Libraries all over the US are lending ebooks.  So, you don't have to buy all the books you want to read.  That's a big saving. And, it takes less than a minute to download a  book.  You just connect your reader with a USB cord and Adobe Digital Editions displays the books you've borrowed & you drag the ones you want to the My NOOKcolor shelf.  As with Kindle, there is also a Lend Me feature so that your friends can borrow from you.The touch screen is very sensitive and I'm very clumsy, so it took me awhile to be able to navigate easily, rapidly, and without bringing up unwanted menus.  But that was true of the iPhone when I got my first one,Why don't I go all the way  and give this 5 stars?  Because the device doesn't have a ""sync to farthest point read"" feature, so if you decide to look at an earlier page,the only way to get back is to use this awkward slider bar.  I can never get it to stop at just the page I want.  The same is true of clicking on endnotes.  When you're through reading them, you have to navigate backwards to the text. There is a Back button displayed on the Notes page, but it disappears before you can read your note.  B&N; has some work to do on this.In sum, if you buy it at Barnes and Noble, the NOOKcolor is only $249, half the price of the cheapest iPad or even Android Tablets.  Yet, for $39.95 more you can get the card to turn it into a full Android Tablet.  It is incredibly more versatile than the Kindle. Page turning is smoother than on the Kindle--or am I the only one who sees the afterimage of the page you're going from while you're turning pages on the Kindle?  On the NOOKcolor, like the iPad, you just touch and you're  on the next page.One other thing: naturally, a touch screen will get smudged.  B&N; says to wipe it with a dry microfiber cloth.  I found that didn't clean it enough.  If the screen isn't clean, it can get jumpy.  So, knowing that the iPhone has a capacitative touch screen as does the NOOKcolor, I tried using the products sold in the Apple Store to clean the screen.  They work perfectly.As mentioned in my earlier review, I also like the NOOKcolor feature of your being able to share a passage with a friend without leaving the page you're reading.  Also, I find the Web browser is just fine. In fact, when I'm  reading and see a name or word I need more info on, I just touch it and when the popup appears, I choose Wikipedia or Google and surf to my heart's content. Then I just touch the ""book"" icon on the lower screen and I'm back to the page I was reading.  It's smooth and fast.I belong to Goodreads and when I'm through with a book, I can just go to the Goodreads app on my NOOKcolor and post my review immediately.

After all, it had music by the Sherman Brothers (best known for their work in Mary Poppins).  And I love a good musical.The book stays very true to the novel.  Tom Sawyer (Johnny Whitaker) is a young boy growing up in 1840's Hannibal, Missouri.  An orphan, he's being raised by his Aunt Polly (Celeste Holm).  And he is quite the handful.  He regularly plays hooky to fish and swim with best pal Huckleberry Finn (Jeff East).  He constantly lies to get out of trouble, too.Through this movie, we watch as Tom struggles with his conscience after witnessing a murder in the cemetery.  He tricks the boys in town to white washing the fence for him.  And he develops a crush on new girl Becky Thatcher (a young Jodie Foster).  But will Injun Joe (Kunu Hank) get his sworn revenge on the boy?This movie is extremely faithful to the book, hitting all the highlights of the classic.  Frankly, that was a problem for me since it took a little while to get going.  Once I got into the story, I was hooked and really began to enjoy the tale.  The scenery and costumes recreate the times well.  And the acting was pretty good.Unfortunately, I found the songs disappointing.  They weren't bad, but they weren't good either.  They aren't especially memorable or singable, and they don't really advance the story.  I would rather rewatch this movie for the characters and adventures then the songs.Despite that rather major flaw for a musical, I must admit to enjoying it.  It has a sweetness and innocence that I enjoyed.  And the songs are easy to overlook since they aren't a major part of the movie.

Moving it back and forth from one side to the other is a huge pain, but it results in a sort of less-dramatic Sophie's Choice: do we leave the AC in the bedroom so we can actually sleep, or leave it in the living room/kitchen so that we can actually get things done without dying of heatstroke? So that's why I bought this fan--to help move air in the kitchen/living area and hopefully make both rooms habitable during the heat. I haven't gotten the chance to test it during a major heat wave yet (hopefully I won't NEED to *crosses fingers*) but so far, I could not be more pleased with how well it works.What I love the most about it is the versatility. It is nearly silent on the ""low"" settings, but when you set it on ""high,"" it moves a LOT of air. The fact that you can flip back and forth between intake and exhaust is really one of the selling points--it's super-handy in our combined kitchen/living room because, when my partner is cooking, we can flip it on to draw out a lot of the heat it produces. If we open up all the rooms, it helps a lot with cross-ventilation--way more than the box fan we were using previously. In addition, our old building has huge radiators which produce a TON of heat in the winter, and the exhaust function, when placed in a window near the radiator, helps a lot with keeping it from becoming too hot in here. Bonus! Basically, it does everything I hoped it would do, and a couple of things I didn't even anticipate.I also love the way it's shaped--it fits nicely in the windowframe, and has a cute retro appeal. It's front-heavy, but still quite easy to move. It's also easy to take apart and put back together for cleaning, which is a HUGE plus.My only complaints, all of which are extremely minor:-I wish it were a little flatter, just because now we can't really close the indoor shutters on that window, but that's an unusual situation (most people probably don't have those!) and I won't fault the design for it.-I'm a little concerned about the switch--it seems a bit flimsy and I'm afraid it'll break if I turn it with too much enthusiasm. But, so far, so good!-while it's pretty quiet, it does make a distinctive noise on the exhaust setting. It's a bit annoying, but if you're more than a few feet away, you can't really hear it--I've used it while napping on the couch before and not found it distracting.",5.0,SO worth the money,1298246400,"02 21, 2011",Home_and_Kitchen,1.0,,

I was able to snag one used on here from a seller named NikonLover for $47!  This thing is really great.  The only complaint I can make is that the page buttons are a little too recessed, but this is not a huge issue as I turn the pages mostly via touchscreen anyways.

There are three books in this box set, and two full color posters the first being a map of romulan space, and the second depicting romulan uniforms and starships in full color.The first book details romulan life and culture. The Way of D'era, the romulan philosophy is interesting. We are also shown how the empire functions, its history, the structure of the Romulan star navy. There is a section on the various worlds which can be explored in Romulan space as well as Romulus and Remus.The second book gives rules for creating romulan characters, as well as guidlines for running an all romulan campaign. There are new traits and skills presented which are romulan specific. The most interesting section is scions of the empire. This section gives stats and descriptions of the movers and shakers of the empire. Included is Senator Kassus, a character whose shadow is felt in the LUG product &quot;A Fragile Peace&quot;.The third book includes two adventures. The first &quot;The Gentera Incident&quot; is an adventure for an all romulan cast. The second, &quot;Duty or Conscience&quot; is an adventure for a cast of starfleet characters.

It doesn't feel cheap, but it certainly doesn't feel as nice as you'd expect for this price.More disappointing though was the flawed design. The case says it's meant for both right handed and left handed writers, however, fails to mention that it's default is for left handed (notepad on the left, iPad on the right). When you switch the notepad around so it's on the right, the iPad Mini faces down (ie. the wrong direction). It doesn't seem so bad except the camera is then pointed in the wrong direction and the cover as well. Thus you either hold it backwards or open and flip it upside down to be on the proper side.These seems like a trivial problem, but when you're paying for a brand that charges for their design aesthetics, it's a bit disappointing. I mean, what percentage of the population writes predominantly with their left hand? I have no issue with it working for both sides but why not have the default option be created for the 80% of the population or make an option that switches back and forth more eloquently.

It's been a real workhorse and has been restrung many times.When I saw that Ektelon released a larger, lighter version, I knew it was time for a change. The old Toron weighs in at a whopping 250g and delivers a fair amount of power, it's just a bit hard to get a good snap on the ball at times and the extra weight puts more stress on my arm.My impression of the new EXO3 RG Toron Lite is very favorable. It weighs in at a svelte 195 grams, has a much larger sweet spot and swings much easier. The extra bit of reach has allowed me to snag balls I would have ordinarily missed and has made my back wall play much more consistent.The new, tacky grip took a bit of getting used to since I've been using leather pretty much since day 1, but it's growing on me quickly. Shifting the racquet for backhands is a bit trickier because of the extra friction and only affected my play for a couple of games.I'm astonished how much of a difference 55 grams has made in my play. I wish I'd picked this up much sooner.Followup after a couple months use (May  14):I'd read a review about fragility, but haven't had any issues in spite of banging off the wall more than a few times.

You get two expansions in one: Undermountain and Skullport. Both feature 3 new Lord cards, 3 new basic building locations (each on a separate small game board), a ton of new buyable buildings, plus a huge amount of new quest and intrigue cards. Skullport includes a Corruption mechanic that penalizes your end-game points by the number of Corruption tokens (blue skulls) you have vs. how many remain on the included Corruption Track (also on a small game board). You gain Corruption by using the awesome new buildings or completing some of the crazy new quests. Corruption is easy to gain but hard to get rid of (ask any politician, lol), but the game includes a number of ways to get rid of it a bit at a time (such as through using certain buildings, completing certain quests, or playing certain intrigue cards). Corruption management is vital. Don't worry about it early, but be sure to start cutting back by mid-game and reversing the number whenever possible.This expansion also includes a 6th player faction, The Gray Hands, and an extra agent meeple for each color with optional rules to play a long game where everyone starts with an extra agent (you must use the long game rules when playing with 6 people). There are also caravan tokens which stand in for large numbers of adventurer cubes in case the supply runs short. In a 3-player game, this only happened once, but I can see it being necessary with 4-6 players because you will gain a lot more adventurer cubes a lot faster using either or both expansions.Tried playing a 3p long game with both expansions, and it tripled the game time to almost four hours, but it (mostly) flew by. Part of the length was because we were learning the new rules and freaking out over the expansion's super-powered new stuff, partly chatting, and one of the players suffers from ""analysis paralysis"" big time, with the other two having milder cases. Pretty sure the game would have only doubled in length if we were less chatty and more familiar with the expansions.Some of the new stuff seems like it might be underpowered or overpowered (and we don't like half the new Lords, including Xanathar who makes your Corruption penalty less, or Halaster Blackcloak and Sangalor who only score by buying their expansion's buildings and completing its quests, which get diluted when using both expansions). Compare those lords to the one who lets you score 6 pts. from any 1 quest type of your choice, or 5 for each 10+ pt. quest you complete). There are several ways to play 2-3 or even more intrigue cards per turn, and that really slows the game down and feels unfair and overpowered to the rest of the players. That said, both my opponents in the 3 player game I mentioned had the ability to play multiple intrigue cards per turn and I still beat them by hardly playing any intrigue cards. I focused on Corruption management, going from a high of 7 to only 1 at the end, which was only worth -4 pts. to me (instead of -28 pts), and solving as many double digit pt. Piety quests as I could (including a 40 pt. one) to get my Lord bonus of 6 pts. for any 1 quest type of my choice.If you combine both Undermountain and Skullport in the same game, you have to remove 12 buildings, 30 quests, and 25 intrigue cards from the base game to accommodate all the expansion stuff. That'd be fine--once--but the rules want you to do it every time you play by randomizing which base set bits are removed. I'm not sure I can imagine only playing with one set after trying both, so maybe the best solution in this case is just to yank all the crappiest stuff out of the base set once and never use them again. Also, when the game is prepped for using both sets next time, neither the new storage tray or base set hold the combined buildings and cards properly, resulting in unsightly sprawl with loose cards floating around and a bunch of buildings having to be split between both boxes--which sucks.Nitpicks aside, I do love this expansion, and you get a TON of stuff to freshen up the game that will keep you going for months. It's a great value and a lot of fun. It's so big and crazy, I'm not sure what the designers can do for the next expansion, but I'm looking forward to finding out!UPDATE #1: Decided after another game using both expansions at the same time that it's just too swingy, too super-crazy, and unpredictable. And the Xanathar lord is broken and guaranteed to make you lose the game, so I've thrown that card out until it gets an official fix. Tried a game using only Undermountain, and that played much more like the regular game, only reasonably souped-up. Game time was increased to about 2 hours, nothing crazy like the 4 hours using both expansions. And I completed four 40 point quests! Will try using only the Skullport expansion next and update my review if necessary, but for right now, I'm advocating you restrain yourself from trying the mega-game and just do Undermountain first, then Skullport, then maybe try to combine them once just to see what that's like. But I think the expansions were not really meant or balanced to be used together.UPDATE #2: After playing just the Skullport expansion, I have to say I'm not that fond of it or its Corruption mechanic. Undermountain is way more fun. Not that Skullport doesn't have good stuff, just that a lot of it is overshadowed by Corruption. I've decided to just streamline the base game and the expansions and weed out all the inferior or overpowered stuff (including anything that gives or removes Corruption), mixing just the cards and buildings that are the most fun. Some of these cards and buildings never get bought or played, so what's the point of bothering with them at all? Still others are possibly broken and OP, like the Yawning Portal (4 gold cost building that gives the user 2 cubes of their choice and the owner one and basically hands them the game if they get it early enough), or the Undermountain building (name escapes me) that lets you play three Intrigue cards. And all the new cards that let you steal people's buildings are unfair and create more hard feelings than fun. That still leaves a ton of good stuff to choose from. I'm knocking my rating down to four stars after having played with this set for about a month. It's not balanced well enough, and I hate that expansion games can take so much longer to play. The game isn't deep enough to support more than 60-90 minutes of play time.",4.0,Updated Review: Waterdeep on steroids!,1377129600,"08 22, 2013",Toys_and_Games,1.0,,

It's true.While doing level 1, after each lesson I was wondering when I was going to learn the basics of French, like say, how to say what your name is or ask how someone is... a va? None of that is covered in level 1. (And so far not in level 2 either...) It's just a bunch of nouns overall. It teaches items and things VERY well, but not how to speak or understand French, which is what I thought was going to happen. The images are super helpful with stuff like that. Picture of a fish >> poisson! Great. But they then throw a bunch of weird grammar at you and you're supposed to know what the difference is between nous and vous by the end, but that didn't happen. It is quite confusing. I found myself keeping Google Translate open so I could understand what exactly the word was that I was being taught.A really, really great thing about Rosetta though is the audio/speaking part. You don't get that with a book. It is a huge plus, but not enough.Instead I have been using textbooks and activity books, and in a few hours have learned more about the basics of French than Rosetta's French Level 1 taught me. I did get some good rrrrrrrrrrrrr practice out of Rosetta though.There is no way you can learn a language through this ""immersion"" crap.

I soon discovered what a pain it was cleaning the grinder, etc., so I quit using the grinder part, and ground my beans in a separate grinder. What I discovered was that this coffee maker, for whatever reason (maybe the so-called ""coffee bar flavor"" system?) made really good FULL flavored coffee.  As the years went on, stuff stopped working on it (the grinder and warming plate), but the coffee continued to be great. Eventually, I had to unplug it at night in order for it to work at all in the morning.  Otherwise, it simply would not turn on.  Once I discovered this, I kept it going for another year or so.  In the mean time, I bought 2 highly recommended coffee makers.  A Cuisinart DCC1200 (I think that was the model number), and a Capresso MT500.  They both looked fantastic, but for whatever reason, would not brew strong full flavored enough coffee.  I did side by side comparisons, using exact same amount of my bold Trader Joes coffee, exact same amount of water, exact same grind.  The old Cuisinart always won, hands down.  Some how the shower head design is able to extract more flavor.  The used grounds are concentrated at the bottom of the filter (I user paper - gold tone filter makes weaker coffee), unlike the other makers, where the grounds seemed to ""bloom"" all over the place and rose almost to the top of the filer.  Anyways, today, I was at Macy's and noticed they are still selling this (in black), even though Cuisinart web site says this is a long discontinued model.  So, I bought one (cheap!!), and tried it out.  I immediately pressed the Grinder off button [I will never use it again] and made coffee.

Their ballads sound sweeter, they incorporate experimentation, and Scott Weiland begins to use his vocal range more and hit higher notes. It doesn't serve a purpose to review each song because all of them (with the exception of ""Meatplow"" personally), were a step in the right direction. The production and mixing is less overwhelming as well which was a huge help in letting the songs breathe and let the life that was in them get a chance to come out and become more vibrant.My personal favorites off this album are: Still Remains, Vasoline, Big Empty, Pretty Penny, and Unglued.In summary, you can't go wrong if you get this album from such an underrated band.

This decent package includes all his early records from his rock and roll teen idol days including a previously unreleased studio track, Money (That's what I want). Christie and his friend and musician Twyla Herbert wrote most of this material and some of the tracks are essential rock and roll classics. Aside from the many original tracks, Lou Christie's cover of the Pentagons 'To be loved' is fantastic, although the lacklustre 'Stay' and 'Tears on my pillow' are not as memorable. I found that the best records on here were some of the least known. To be honest I'm pretty tired of 'The Gypsy Cried and 'Two Faces Have I, purely because I've heard them millions of times, but 'You may be holding my baby' and 'There they go' are two of the best records that I've listened to on a rock and roll CD for quite some time.Christie didn't follow suit with his amazing two tone voice and opt for the typical 'Italian Doo Wop' sound, instead he was usually backed by female singers known as The Tammys, which is a neat and individual touch. Although his number one hit, Lightening Strikes is missing - due to him changing labels before releasing it - this is probably the best CD to get by LOU CHRISTIE. I'm a fairly harsh critic, but although not every track is excellent, I can find little to criticise on this fine CD. Buy this one and then get the one with 'Lightening strikes' and his cover of 'Teenager in love' on.

The Amazon web page says it's a NV5435u and if you read down further, it says the model is NV5423u. The 5435 model is the blue cover version while the 5423 has a cherry red cover; that's the difference - the product specs are the same otherwise as far as I can tell.  I needed a new laptop with a bigger screen and when first searching, I thought I should be able to find a 15"" screen or so at a lower price, considering how PC prices have dropped over time.  That didn't pan out, I ended up in the $450+ price range. I chose this one as it offers a nice 15.6"" widescreen, has alot of RAM and disk space and another feature I wanted was the HDMI-out connection so I can plug this directly into my HDTV.Once I got the laptop, I was very pleasantly surprised with the crispness of the display as compared to my Toshiba Satellite that's a few years old and also to my IBM Thinkpad from the office.  This Gateway screen at the default resolution has the sharpness you get with high-definition TV.  The difference in the display quality is very obvious - and I used to think my other laptops had very nice screen quality, but now they pale in comparison. Speaker quality is very good. I also like the keyboard, it's crisp, does not have that cheap feel to it and contains a numeric keypad, which I like.  My other laptops have Windows XP Pro, which I like and I'm always skeptical about the need for Microsoft to develop a new operating system, but the Windows 7 on here is quick to boot up and is user friendly.  The messages that pop up are a bit more straightforward and complete.The Gateway Games console is installed on it with a number of Wild Tangent games.  It was disappointing to find that my Trend Micro Internet Security software found the Cryp_Mangled virus in about 100 of the files related to these games.  I got rid of all of the games in the console, even the few that didn't come up with a virus.  Internet research indicated Wild Tangent has said that there's just some code in some files that looks like a virus, but isn't - other info on the internet says Wild Tangent is spyware.  To be on the safe side, I got rid of it all , rescanned and the PC is fine.  Gateway would be best off not pre-loading this on their machines. It sounds like a number of computer manufacturers preload this particular game package on their machines.  Overall, I'm very happy with this purchase and highly recommend this impressive laptop.",5.0,Very Nice Quality and Features,1267833600,"03 6, 2010",Electronics,,"{'CS': 0.801147229, 'MNR': 0.0, 'RB': 0.0, 'RC': 22.0, 'PR': 54.54545455, 'NR': 22.72727273, 'FR': 0.045454545, 'RSP': 0.0, 'AW': 3407.0, 'RD': 0.0, 'RL': 2460.0, 'ER': 1.0, 'PC': 3.144016227}",0.0

I've made sorbet, slush drinks and of course ice cream in it.  The waiting time for the bowl to refreeze is irritating at times, but buying an extra freezer bowl (or 2!) solves that problem easily.  After 3 years of intense use the plastic paddle is still perfect (even after putting it in the dishwasher every time), the freezer bowl looks brand new, and the motor is chugging along happily.  I've cracked the dome lid in a few places but that hasn't impaired it's performance (the dome lid holds the paddle stable so that the ice cream is churned while the freezer bowl is turned by the motor) because of the wavy design at the bottom of the lid where it meets the motor base -you'd have to really destroy the lid for it not to work anymore.  If it died tomorrow I'd buy exactly the same machine, I've definitely got my money's worth.  The only thing I wish is that the freezer bowl was larger capacity because many of the old ice cream recipes I have need to be adjusted to fit.  But with the price (even the price of 80$ US I paid for it when it first came out) you can't complain!  Quick tips: 1.  Many of Ben &amp; Jerry's ice cream recipes are available free on the net -they're the best I've ever tried!  2.  Feel free to add almost anything to your ice cream -the motor can handle nuts, chocolate chunks and frozen fruit. 3.  Always dry the freezer bowl thoroughly before freezing to avoid ice buildup on the bowl -complete air drying is best. 4.  Let it run as long as necessary for the ice cream to reach the proper thick rippling consistency.  5.  Don't keep the ice cream in the freezer too long or after it's made or it will lose that fresh homemade consistency and taste (under a week is best).",5.0,"Owned it for over 3 years, still making great ice cream!",1057190400,"07 3, 2003",Home_and_Kitchen,1.0,,

As soon as it arrived, I cleaned the bucket and put it in the freezer, and checked the parts.  Sure, it's a bit plasticky, but that's okay with me.  Then found a recipe for sorbet, made the base and put it in the fridge.  Two hours before churning, I put the base in the freezer.After reading so many complaints about the noise, I expected something  between a vacuum cleaner and an airplane. That's why I was very pleasantly surprised at how quiet the unit is.  I talked to my son on my cell phone right next to it while it was running, and I had no problem hearing him.  Sure, it makes some noise, but nothing like a blender and quieter than our kitchen fan on medium.After 20 minutes, I checked and the mixture was thickening, so I gave it another 20 minutes.  When I was finished, my mixture had the texture of a thick milkshake, so I popped it in the freezer and it hardened right up.  After 20 minutes, the bucket was still very cold even though it was over 80 in the house.So far, so good.

This device fills a niche- if you want to annotate pdf documents or watch movies or any of those other things, get a tablet or the iPad or the kindle fire. This device is designed to read books, and it does a beautiful job at it. I purchased my Sony reader expecting to be able to add comments in it, but it was way too difficult, and ultimately I decided to purchase an iPad. Like the Sony reader, the nook can take notes but wouldn't be a great device to purchase for that purpose.It was pretty easy to set up- I didn't read the instruction manual, but I usually don't. I just followed the on screen instructions to connect it with my internet, my barnes and noble account, and then plugged it into my computer to sync it with library books. I had a bit of trouble connecting it with my internet, but that has happened with every new device I've purchased, so I think its my internet's fault, not the nook. I went through the steps a few times and then it started worked.I really like holding it to read- I generally read ridiculously thick books, so its nice to have something small and light to hold instead of a massive book that I have to prop up (and its so much nicer to read from than an iPad- the iPad is fine to read from, and i never seemed to feel screen fatigue, but it is way too heavy to hold with one hand). Initially I didn't realize that the two buttons on either side of the screen move the page forward or back, so I was touching the screen each time- the delay time is a bit longer that way, and it was annoying to have to use both hands. As soon as I realized that the buttons existed, the experience got even better.The battery life seems great- I charged it all the way up using my usb-to-outlet power adapter that I have for my iphone/ipad, and it worked great. I haven't had to charge it again, and I've been reading for about an hour each day.The one thing that surprised me and was frustrating for a few minutes was when I realized that I couldn't load my other epub books onto the nook because there wasn't enough room. The advertised size of the nook is 2gb, which is a ton of books, but it wasn't enough room for the books I've acquired through other sources- like google book downloads. A quick google search solved this problem- barnes and noble appropriates the majority of this space for content you purchase directly from barnes and noble. Fortunately there is an easy solution- there is a slot for a microSD card, and I happened to have a 2gb one lying around- plus they only cost about $5, if that. I popped it in, turned the device off and on, and I was ready to go again. Not a deal-killer by any means, but something to consider if you're planning to add your own epub library to your nook.Kindle vs. Nook- I haven't owned a kindle, only used it for a few minutes, but my personal opinion as I decided which to purchase was this: price was important (and I got a great black friday deal on the nook), and since they were about the same price I wanted to support the more open epub format, since you can load books from other sources. Yes, its possible to convert epub to kindle format but its an extra step that many people won't be interested in. I would have purchased the kindle with special offers, and hadn't thought much about it, but I've enjoyed the pictures of authors that show up on my nook screen, and would probably get annoyed by the commercials/make a point to put my nook in a case so I didn't have to see them.Durability- I haven't abused it by any stretch of the imagination- yet- but it did take a fall off a coffee table and didn't crack/break/show any sort of damageI'll update my review as I have more time to play with it in the next few months",5.0,Great purchase- you won't regret it,1323388800,"12 9, 2011",Electronics,1.0,,

When you hold it you really understand what design is - beauty, function and form.  The machining is excellent, everything lines up, the materials are good, and the blades sharp.At 2 3/4"" closed, the Peanut is similar to a classic small slip-blade pen knife, only the 2 blades (longer clip and smaller pen) are side-by-side rather than one on each end.  This makes it a little bit thicker, but it's still very much a light, comfortable to carry loose in the pocket every day, knife.  Both blades have 90 degree half-stops.The Peanut is sold with either ""Chrome Vanadium"" (carbon) or ""Tru-Sharp surgical"" (stainless) steel blades.  The CV steel should take and hold a sharper edge (mine was very sharp out of the box and is holding it well), but will loose their luster and develop a light patina over time.  Mine's doing pretty well - you only get minor graying around the tip and thumb-nail mark unless you use it to cut fruit.  Cutting an apple caused some near immediate discoloration.  However the luster came back with a bit of metal polish.  Several months later, I bought my brother-in-law the SS version.  It has a really nice blade with a great edge - sharpest SS pocket knife blade I've seen out of the box.  Given the quality of Case's stainless, I'd lean towards it.The Peanut is sold in a number of handle materials / colors including synthetic, bone, stag, corelon, and mother of pearl.  The handle material you choose affects the price greatly.  Yellow Synthetic is a popular lower cost option that provides good looks, durability and value.  It is solid and quite hard (like Corian, not plastic) and very resistant to dings.  The color is a soft lemon cream that looks really nice against the polished silver / nickel bolsters (to me at least). The brass side rivets are flush and all seams are smooth to the touch.  I really like it and would choose it again.Not much to add.  It's a well made, well written up, elegantly designed classic little knife.  There's a reason Case has such a following.  This is about my 20th pocket knife but my first Case.  It is something special and doesn't have a crazy price tag.

After speaking with customer service, I discovered that unless you pay extra to have an electronic copy made, the original pages the child draws on are simply bound into a book. The markers provided in the kit bleed through on the back so you see this when you turn the page.  It takes forever to get the book back which I can't understand if they're simply binding the existing pages. I've made quite a few books on Shutterfly and Winkflash.  From time to time, they have promotional offers where you can get up to 100 pages for under $20 (less than the cost of Illustory). You can upload photos or scan a drawn picture and upload that.  Also, with either company you don't have a word limit of 20 words per page.  Depending on the size of the font you choose, you can type in 200 words or more per page with either service.  The other drawback with Illustory that I didn't discover until speaking with customer service is that if you don't pay extra, they will auto correct the misspelled words.

This German-made game beats familiar games like Monopoly and Risk hands-down.OBJECTEach player must complete a series of rail lines spanning cities based upon destination cards drawn at the beginning (and throughout) the game. Each destination carries points related to the length of the line, so a New York to Los Angeles line would score more points than Chicago to Boston. Incomplete destinations count against players at the end of the game, so completing them, even through circuitous routes is a must. The exciting part of the game comes from not knowing who is completing his or her lines, plus the ability to overlap lines, stymieing other players.Game play takes between 30 and 90 minutes depending on the number of players and the speed at which they make decisions.GAME PIECESHigh quality throughout, the game includes:- A fold-out board of the United States and southern Canada, plus a scoring track around the edge. The cities on the board connect through colored track lines, each line between one and six units in length.- A set of destination cards showing lines that must be completed.- Five sets of forty-five train pieces. Each player takes one same-color set of trains.- A set of colored train cards that correspond to the colored lines that connect cities.- Scoring markers that correspond to a player's train color.PLAYEach player is dealt three destination cards in the beginning and must keep at least two. These form the basis for their lines. They also receive four train cards. To claim a line, players must create sets of the same color and number of train cards as the line connecting two cities. (The color of the lines has nothing to do with the player's train color, but the cards they have in hand.)Each player, in turn, can perform one of three actions:1. Draw two train cards per turn from either the set of five placed up for all players to see, or blind from the train card deck. (One card if one of the showing wild cards is chosen.)2. Play a set of matching train card colors to claim a line between two cities.3. Get dealt a new set of three destination cards, keeping at least one.Players score points when they claim a line of track connecting two cities, the length of the track yielding proportionately higher scores. Scoring markers are moved around the 100-point scoring guide on the board perimeter.When one player has laid all his or her train pieces, the other players get one last turn. Players then reveal their destination cards and add (or subtract, for incomplete lines) to their total. The longest continuous length of claimed track scores additional points, too. Highest point total wins.REVIEWPros:A gorgeous, well-made game that's easy on the eyes, Ticket to Ride combines simple rules and nail-biting game play with a significant level of strategy. You can't ask for more in a board game.All ages will love this game. Even children as young as six can play since the rules are simple.Will please folks sick of the usual board games everyone has.Game play is short enough to allow multiple sessions of play.The manufacturer has other games in the Ticket to Ride series that work off the same basic gaming system, though with differing degrees of skill (through additional rules and trickier city layouts). Expansion kits exist, too, so players familiar with the game can get an additional kick out of their existing set. Lastly, an online, multi-player, interactive version of the game can be played through the manufacturer's Web site.Cons:The manufacturer lists a game session as lasting 30-60 minutes. We've found it closer to 45-90 minutes.Ticket to Ride has been around since 2004 and is beginning to show some age when compared against newer European-style board games. In addition, other games in the Ticket to Ride series eclipse the base game (though some expansions require the base game for play). For a game that plays similarly to Ticket to Ride but adds more depth of play, consider Ticket to Ride designer Alan Moon's Airlines Europe.OVERALLAs someone who loves games, I found Ticket to Ride to be a great introduction to European-style board games. Nothing disappoints. Everyone who plays the game wants to know where to get a copy. Ticket to Ride has won numerous Game of the Year honors around the world, and it's easy to see why. Absolutely worthy of its stars.UPDATE: For enhanced play, consider the 1910 expansion. It includes larger, easier-to-read cards, additional destinations, and more winning conditions. It makes a four-star game into five!",4.0,"Outstanding strategy game that's easy to learn, tough to master",1167696000,"01 2, 2007",Toys_and_Games,1.0,,

I decided it was time to upgrade my original Nook and went with this tablet. I purchased mine direct from B&N. This is a fantastic ereader with a few tablet functions. I really like the interface on this ereader more so than the Kindle Fire. Don't get me wrong, the Kindle Fire is a very nice device, but I like the personal touch I can give the Nook HD. It's more customizable.I can create my own wallpaper and customize my home screen. The ereader is very light and easy to hold with a contoured, grippy back. The screen resolution is fantastic! Even small print is readable. The colors in magazines is exceptional and the scrapbook feature is an innovative touch. I really appreciate having a physical home button, and external volume rockers & power button. The interface is very user friendly and aesthetically pleasing. Setting up email was a snap and customizing my security settings from lock screen passwords to shopping passwords is much appreciated. Web browsing is very zippy on this device. More zippy than the Kindle Fire. Ereading is also a pleasure, with customizable fonts & backgrounds. I was surprised at how well I was able to read on it outside in the shade. It still has a lot of glare, but it is much more readable than the Ipad or the Kindle Fire.I can't see the Ipad or Kindle Fire screen at all outside with all the glare. Nook HD is NOT as readable as an eink screen, so I will be keeping my original Nook of 3 years for outdoor reading. But for a tablet ereader, I was really surprised at how well it did outside in the shade. I have since given my husband the Ipad 2, as I like the 7"" form factor of the ereader/tablet devices. I take them with me everywhere. If you were to ask me which I liked better, the Kindle Fire or the Nook HD...well...I wouldn't be able to choose. Amazon has a larger store for books, apps, movies etc....but I like B&N's Nook HD for it's interface, superb screen and customizable home screen. It also has expandable memory, and you can sideload epub books. I also like the look of the Nook HD better. It would come down to personal preference and which store you have the most investment with.

This travel pouch which you wear around your neck is the perfect answer. The middle pocket is big enough to store your passport and any other IDs or documents you need to secure and even has a divider. There are two side pockets so you can divide up your money to big bills and small bills, or use one for money and the other for credit cards, whatever you want. The neck cord is adjustable so it can be easily made to fit anyone. I found this pouch easier to use than the ones you wear across your waist because I was able to access it either by pulling it down below my shirt or up through the top of my shirt (whichever was easier with the shirt I was wearing). The material it is made out of is nice because it never irritated my skin; in fact, I mostly forgot I had it on except when I needed it.

Because the ball gets a good spin on it from the paddle you can throw it in a slightly different direction than you really want it to go and it will curve gracefully through the air.  Please do note that the ball is hard and fairly weighty and can really hurt you or your child.My best throw ever occurred when my brother and I agreed to stand still and see if we could hit the other person.  Keep in mind we are like 100ft apart so that this was not an easy task.  On my very first throw the ball left the cradle fast and furious with a slight downward slant that then gracefully curved upwards toward his face.  The ball would have literally hit him straight in the face if he hadn't cheated at the last second by ducking.

You have a quest to finish (like ""get to room X and kill the bad guy"") and dozens of bad guys in the way.Each player is on the same side and has a set of skills vital to the success of the mission. The fighter might stand in front while engaging bad guys with the healing cleric while a wizard exacts utter destruction over the baddies.Everyone feels like they are vital to the game.

Screen 'bruising.'  The build of the machine is sleek, lightweight, and attractive, with aluminum cladding on almost every surface except the bottom and the touchpad.  However, because the lid is so thin, the screen tends to 'bruise' against the keys.  It's not likely to be a problem with my carrying bag (I keep a padded sleeve *inside* a padded pocket and don't overload with other items), and I certainly hope it's not a problem with me simply grasping the computer to lift it out of its pocket, but it's disappointing all the same in terms of durability, especially since I have had mine only just over a year and tend to be *very* careful and protective.2.  Processor speed.  My machine has an AMD 2Ghz Quad-Core A10-4655M Processor, admittedly a lesser version of what is currently on sale.  It's my first non-Intel processor, and it's noticeably slower, at times much slower than I would like.  Things tend to lock up, although to the overall system's credit (I've largely left the system in factory-release configuration) they do tend to release in a few seconds unscathed.  Very few actual crashes, but the lag is frustrating.  I'm not a graphics user or gamer, either--we're talking about multiple browser tabs in a single window, a couple of moderately-sized PDFs, and 6 or 7 Word files open simultaneously (no specialized programs, pictures, or video), which a processor should really be able to cope with.I think I'd still consider another Samsung machine, but only with a much better processor and with some evidence that the screen isn't going to scratch and blur.

Simon,"[3, 5]","I waited several months to write the review so I could talk about the product over a longer period other than just the first use.Like most people I use the bands for P90X and they work great. When I started the program I was using dumbells and the bands are much better. My results per workout are almost twofold with the bands, since the resistance provides an isometric workout. These bands also give you more flexibility in terms of how much weight/resistance you want compared to the P90X bands.I had 2 concerns when I first purchased them:(1) My workout room gets extremely hot during the summer and I was worried that it would affect the band's elasticity. I've had them all summer and so far I haven't seen any signs of degredation due to the heat.(2) The description of the product has the max weight equivalent as 35 lbs with the red bands, I was worried this wouldn't be high enough for me. However this proved to be an unfounded fear, since when you hold the bands on the muscle contraction it increases the workout exponentially (much more difficult than dumbells)There are two concerns I still have however:(1) For P90X some of the workouts require you to step on the bands. If you are mixing two bands for increased weight it is incredibly difficult to find a good balance for both bands on both arms. In this situation one arm will experience more resistance than the other.(2) My sneakers have tiny, soft rubber, spike shaped treads on arch (maybe only 1/16 of an inch or less in diameter). When I stepped on one of the bands with the arch of my foot I noticed the band got several pinholes from the treads. This worries me because I'm afraid thif at over time these pin holes will grow and one day the bands might break. None of the other bands have this issue since I didn't use the arch of my foot for them, so I recommend that you don't use shoes with miniature spike like treads on them when stepping on the bands.The door latch works perfectly too, doesn't slip out at all like someone people have had concerns about. I haven't used the ankle brace yet.I recommend using gloves with the bands for shoulder press and tricep exercises, as the cloth on the handles will rub against the back side of your hands.Its the perfect price, I used the free super saver shipping, Amazon said 5-8 business days, it came in two.

I found that it was easiest to hold my finger underneath to prevent the USB from sliding back because it doesn't stay in place perfectly without a little help.

Since they offered a trial or demo disk, I ordered a disk and tried it.  It seemed good and I liked all the improvements over version 2.  So I decided to buy the the program.  To Rosetta Stone's credit, this version is a giant step forward in interaction and variation of teaching methods to keep the Vietnamese student involved and interested.  The package includes a headphone & microphone set so you can speak the words you hear, and the computer will let you know if you're pronouncing the words and phrases correctly.  In fact, you can set the program's tolerance level of your pronounciation.  This new version also allows you to type in the words and phrases your hear, thereby helping you to learn how to spell the new language you are speaking.Unfortunately, in spite of all these new improvements, there were two problems (serious problems in my evaluation) that made me return the program for a refund.  The first problem was pronounciation.  Vietnamese is a tonal language; in fact, it has 6 different tones.  Also, there is a significant difference between the North Vietnamese dialect and the South Vietnamese dialect.  This program proportedly teaches the northern dialect, but the pronounciation is not correct.  In version 2, the pronounciation was textbook perfect; each tone was distinct and precise.  In version 4, they've gotten sloppy.  Specifically the high-rising tone used in some words (like con cho' [= dog], con ga'i [= girl], etc.) is pronounced  with a falling, rising tone (like pha?i [= yes] or ho?i [= question].  My wife, who is Vietnamese, confirmed these mispronounciations.The other problem is the method used to type in Vietnamese words.  When Vietnamese people type proper Vietnamese with tone marks, they usually use one of two methods: VIQR and VNI. (Look up these methods on the internet.)  But, Rosetta Stone doesn't use either of these common methods; instead have come up with their own method.  Unfortunately, it is very cumbersome and painfully slow.So, because of these 2 serious problems, I can't fully reccommend this program.  There are many other programs available that teach Vietnamese.  One I CAN recommend is called ""A Little Vietnamese"" by Griesser Software.  This program is unique in that it teaches both North and South Vietnamese dialects and the differences between them.  Unfortunately, it does not work on Macintosh computers, unless you have a Windows-simulator program (like Virtual PC or Parallels).

As I inventory the features, the NOOK seems to be superior. The reason is fundamentally that the navigation is made supremely more intuitive with the touch screen. The on-screen keyboard / menu items are actually useful to the consumers who really could benefit from these devices more than anyone: the elderly. The keyboard, being onscreen, is highly readable, though there is no adjustment for typeface variation or size to resolve reading difficulty, which seems to render other accommodations for the visually impaired redundant. What use is it to adjust the text inside the book, if it is difficult to read the menu and to navigate to the book in the first place? Though it is worth saying again, all items are indeed highly readable even without the adjustment capacity on the menu / keyboard levels. It is an improvement over the Kindle, which has the same weakness compounded with the static keyboard with low-contrast printed letters thereupon, and a more complicated menu system.When looking through the documentation that accompanies the device, and at BN.com, there is absolutely NO mention of the built-in memory whatsoever. 236MB is not a good selling point, but I find this evasive to completely hide this attribute from the consumer until having the device in hand and navigating the settings. It tarnishes my opinion of Barnes & Noble. Were it not for the overall superiority of this device over others, I would question whether or not to do business with them. That said, the ""offense"" is offset in part because I feel that most folks who would consider owning this device will already have a memory expansion on hand, probably left over after upgrading from early models of smartphones or cameras.There is no way to set the ""default"" storage to your memory expansion. The only method I have discovered to direct how memory is utilized without hacking the device is by connecting / synchronizing with a computer and manually placing files in the preferred locations.What really sold me on this device was the touch screen, intuitive / simple menu system, and its ability to use books borrowed from the library. The menus and on-screen keyboard functions, and the basic functions were learned within 2 weeks by my very elderly great-aunt. She had never before used a similar computerized device, though the learning curve is similar to that of a microwave oven. I believe this speaks well to the design team, though also indicates room for improvement.Regarding the ""Social"" features of the NOOK Touch: this is generally a nice feature. One can synchronize with Google, Facebook, and Twitter, posting commentary and inviting discussion and response to the material being shared. THE DOWN SIDE is that this is only supported if Barnes and Noble actually sold the book to the user. Side-loaded material is not up for discussion.There is a lightly functional Web browser embedded in the Search function of the NOOK Touch. It is basically the equivalent of a Mobile Web browser. I have had some mixed success with it. It does work, though I have found it to be rather unstable. Of the 5 tests I've run with it, It has caused the device to crash on 2. This was navigating the mobile version of Facebook. It was not advertised as a feature at all, so the fact that it exists is kind of an Easter Egg. Things to note with it are that the pages it loads are more difficult to read, since the Web is rendered in color and when rendering into gray scale the contrast tends to be low. However, it is useful to look up information in books that may be linked, or to post commentary on your Facebook / Google / Twitter accounts.One item which might prove important to a few, which I discovered to my disappointment is that the NOOK will not recognize a WiFi access point created by your cell phone. I realize that this is not likely a highly common issue, but it was an assumption I had made before purchasing the device for my great-aunt. This issue is not specifically the NOOK. It is because the NOOK is running on Android (according to the developers of the WMWifiRouter application). That said, the Kindle is also unable to access the Internet in this fashion. It's speculative to say whether or not this is a security measure based on my information set, but it is an issue that I'm sure at least a few others will wish to have known before purchasing.A case is a worthwhile consideration. Carrying the NOOK in one's pocket can create some issues with the touch screen, and it tends otherwise to cause the device to crash. However, I find that the so-called fashionable cases are absurdly priced. Consider at least two things before purchasing such items: they are made from cardboard wrapped in fabric; they are being offered for between $20 and $50. If you have an ambitious child, or an impulse to manufacture a cover with the same or better functionality as the covers available for the device, it is absolutely worthwhile to pursue that angle.I would consider buying this device again given the offerings on the market now.",4.0,Convenient Device; Where's the Memory?,1310688000,"07 15, 2011",Electronics,1.0,,

While the older MAP76 model included a database of coastal navigational aids (buoys, lights, nuns, cans, whistles, gongs, lighthouses, etc), this model DOES NOT include any of these.  If you turn on this model and scroll over to Boston Harbor or San Francisco Bay, it will show you where the water is and where the land begins, but nothing more.  No navigational aids whatsoever.  Yes, it will give you lat/lon fixes like any GPS.  And it will give you speed and heading information.  But that's it.  Of course, Garmin tells you that you can purchase the detailed marine charts (they cost $100-$200 each for just a single area...in the Northeast, you would need to purchase many of these to get complete coverage) and this is understood.  But most serious boaters use detailed paper charts and/or a plotter and don't need their handheld for that kind of detail.  What a handheld is good for, however, is to show where you are in relation to a bell or a light you may be running toward in the fog or in the dark or in relation to a known waypoint.  The old version (MAP 76) gave you these bells and lights.  This one does not.  So unless you want to add many hundreds of dollars to your $275-$300 purchase price, this is the wrong model for a handheld GPS as backup.  Get the older MAP 76 instead.  For less than $200, you will have more than you need as a helpful boater's unit and no need to buy electronic charts.  Of course, the MAP 76 is B&W and not color, possibly less sensitive, and lacks all the bells and whistles.  But it is WAY more simple to use.  This MAP 76CSx is very complicated because it has built in all the highway, hiking, climbing, geocaching, urban features and capabilities that you will never use.  Just figuring out the setup takes hours.  Bottom line...Garmin is a great product.  But if you're a serious boater (not wanting to drop a thousand on a complicated handheld) and someopne who navigates with paper charts or a regular chart plotter, you don't want this model...you want the MAP76.

We now enjoy looking for and trying out new and interesting boardgame options.One of our treasured finds is ""Ticket to Ride.""  It is no mystery to board game enthusiasts that this is a great game, but just in case you don't run in those circles or visit those web sites, here's the scoop on this game.What you should know about this game if you are considering it:1) It can accommodate up to 5 players.2) The game works best for players aged 10 and up (though the box says 8 and up).  Our 9-yr-old was able to pick up on this game, but it takes a bit longer to play than her gaming attention span is at the moment, and she likes to play games.3) This game may take up to an hour to play, though quicker play by experienced players can cut that time in half.In this game players are competing rail barons in the year 1900.  At the start of the game each player draws three destination cards that indicate the beginning and ending cities of a RR line (e.g., Denver to New Orleans).  Players choose to keep at least two of those destination cards and they collect colored RR car cards that they can trade in to claim segments of RR lines needed to connect cities on their destination cards.  Players earn points for each RR segment they complete, for completion of the RR indicated on destination cards, and for completing the longest continuous RR line.As as you play you need to beware that as you are working to complete a RR line you could be blocked either accidentally or on purpose (depending on the personalities of your competitors) when another player builds on a RR segment you need.  If that happens, that just means that you need to find an alternative way to get to complete the RR line between your destinations.It takes good judgement to decide when and where to build your RR segments, as well as when to select additional destination cards.Just so you know, on a player's turn they can either collect up to two colored RR car cards, build a RR segment, or draw new destination cards.This is a fun game that can be enjoyable for tweenaged children and grown-ups alike.Since there are way more destination cards included with the game than can be built during any one game, and since the shuffling of those cards, as well as the large number of colored RR car cards is large, the game is never the same twice.Another perk of this game, in addition to it's overal enjoyability is the fact that as you play you can learn some geography of North America (some Canadian cities are also included).Fun and educational.When you are ready to move beyond games like ""Candyland"", ""The Game of Life"", etc., try this one out.Also, just in case you didn't know, there are also other versions of ""Ticket to Ride"" for Europe, Germany, and Switzerland (some of which are stand-alone games, and some of which are expansion games).In any case, this particular game is a solid 5-star option, easily played (once you get through your first few games).I hope this was helpful.",5.0,"Family time, geography, and fun.",1232150400,"01 17, 2009",Toys_and_Games,1.0,,

The NOOK Color has many features that appealed to me like touchscreen, vivid view technology, brightness adjustments, really nice web browser and mp3 player, etc. So I decided to order one with BlueProton cause they ship it to Canada, and I paid 60 dollars more than the actual price at B&N; and expedited shipping taxes on top of that. I didn't care, I just wanted my NC cause honestly I'm just tired of buying AAA batteries for my Clip light to read my Kindle 3 in bed. I noticed I never read in bright sunlight, I'm an indoors type of reader and I also like to browse while I read, mostly wikipedia and google and the Kindle we browser is primitive.Anyways, I got the NC promptly, I was super excited, but then I tried to transfer my epub books to it and noticed that my computer didn't recognize the unit's drive. Nothing popped. I had my iphone and my kindle plugged in and they were right there. I went to a friend's house and nothing popped on his computer either. A third try at a different laptop and same thing: nada. I went back home and kept trying and all of a sudden I started seeing smoke coming out of the USB port and a smell of burned toast. Really strong. I knew that unit was gone and that freaked me out. Everything else worked perfectly, but the USB was pooched. I returned it and they were very professional about it, but said that they found nothing wrong with the device. I bet they just reset it and tested ome of the features without actually testing its hardware. Anyways, I said I didn't want that unit back. Now here I am, with no Nook Color, nobody else sends it to Canada. I'm contacting friends in the US so I can send it to them, buying it straight from B&N; and then they can mail it to me. It's just weird that at this day and age we still can't have items shipped internationally, even when we're willing to pay more money for that luxury.Now I'm again using my Kindle like crazy, since it's all I got and it never fails. But I'm still gonna buy the NC no matter what. I just don't know if I'll sell my Kindle 3 in the future or keep it because it has sentimental value now, hehe.I think that for 249 US dollars, the NC is the best e-reader in the market. Right now the Kindle still leads and the iPad is coming strong, but 2011 will be the year the Nook Color will establish itself as a great competitor for these other two. If Amazon doesn't come up with a color Kindle with touchscreen, I strongly believe they will be the Betamax and VHS of the 2000s. But I really like the Kindle and if they came up with something like a reader's tablet, I would use it instead of using B&N;'s. However, that still hasn't happened and Jeff Bezos says he doesn't want that to happen just now. So I'll purchase a Nook Color and be happy with it.",3.0,Great device but why not ship it to Canada?,1292457600,"12 16, 2010",Electronics,0.0,,

LIke Amazon, B&N; tries to lock readers in to purchasing from their store, but if you're resistant, it's easy to side-load books using Adobe Digital Editions or Calibre on either device. I've used both the Nook and Kindle readers and purchased the Nook ST for my personal use because I prefer to have buttons as well as the touch screen. This proved a prudent choice since the touch screen on the NST started malfunctioning about 6 months in. At first, using a Q-Tip to clean the edges of the screen worked (it's not a calibrated screen, but works using light sensors that can be blocked by dust). Then certain areas of the screen completely stopped working. I could not access my library, etc. I'll spare you the details of my four infuriating chats with B&N; customer service, but I ended up returning my Nook more than two weeks ago for them to look at and replace with a functional unit. I have heard nothing about its status since.Compare this to the customer service I received from Amazon when our work Kindle malfunctioned -- they replaced it without a murmur, after an actual phone conversation with an actual person. I sent in the old unit and we had a new one three days later.I think in a lot of ways the NST is superior to the Kindle Touch -- epub format, side buttons, ability to be hacked and used as a tablet -- but if I end up having to buy another ereader, I will seriously consider converting my ebook library to mobi and purchasing a Kindle, because if (when) something goes wrong with my ereader, I want someone to care. I'm sure I'll eventually get a response from B&N; and maybe a replacement Nook, but the hoop-jumping is a bummer.",3.0,"Great reader, poor customer service from B&N",1356480000,"12 26, 2012",Electronics,0.0,,

The ""lifetime"" belt has had to be replaced every few months, I'm on my third one and that just broke.  The belt is $13, but, over $25 for the labor to put in a new one since it's virtually impossible for a normal person to change it, although the manual does warn you that if their ""LIFETIME"" belt DOES break, you pretty much need to hire someone to replace it.  Even the repair guy said it's one of the most difficult belts to get to that he's ever worked on, he has a difficult time. He also said this vacuum has a reputation for problems.  I contacted Hoover about it and they said that it's a ""lifetime"" belt if it doesn't go through any difficulties, like something caught in the roller.  They suggested I raise the level, too.  If I raise it any higher, the brush doesn't even touch the carpet.  So, basically, the belt lasts a lifetime if you don't use the vacuum the way you need to.  And when it breaks, it costs a fortune to replace.  Also, I'm so disappointed in their lack of customer service. Calling their number just gives you a recording that gives you the number of a repair person in your area.  You never get to talk to a customer service person.  I had to email my complaint to get hold of Hoover instead of a repair person, and there was no apology or sign of interest or acceptance of any responsibility.  I have also had a problem with the switch since almost the beginning, and the hook for the cord broke early on.  And, like the other reviews, it doesn't have any suction on hardwood floors.

Roll a die, move your pawn, answer a question. Questions come in 4 flavors. You have Left and Right Brain questions, which as far as I can tell are not different in any way. Third is 'Spot the Liar' which is a 50/50 shot at a right answer. These questions are written so badly the true answer is always extremely obvious. ""How did this Historic person die? A) Poisoned by a lover or B) Bats trained by a wicked witch drained him of all his blood"" Hum I wonder which of those could be made up. Lastly you have ""Enlightening Round"" cards. With these you must answer 3 questions just to get one point. Then you can risk that point to try to earn an extra turn. So this gives you a chance to work 3 times as hard, and get no extra bonus. FUN! You also start the game with 2 ""Mental Block"" cards that let you retry a question, or make someone lose a turn. Pro Tip kids, save these for the 50/50 Spot the Liar questions. Rulebook doesn't say you can't!The components for the game are fairly low rent. The cards feel very thin and slick. The tokens are cardboard and only one sided. Board is fine, even if a little uninteresting.If you want a fun trivia game that people will actually enjoy stick with Wits and Wagers.The only good thing about Mental Floss is that it comes with an issue of the fairly enjoyable magazine.",1.0,"Boring, low rent trivia game",1262649600,"01 5, 2010",Toys_and_Games,,"{'CS': 0.562411819, 'MNR': 0.0, 'RB': 0.0, 'RC': 4.0, 'PR': 75.0, 'NR': 25.0, 'FR': 0.0, 'RSP': 0.0, 'AW': 353.0, 'RD': 3.482758621, 'RL': 1362.0, 'ER': 1.0, 'PC': 2.667893284}",0.0

My charger worked fine for about 2 months. Between regular usage on my Samsung Epic and letting people in the car with the same port plug in their phone, the charger no longer works properly. In the beginning, I could talk on the phone or have it in any position while charging. Over the 2 months the charger started getting more particular about what position it could be charged in. As of the review it only works with the phone in a horizontal position on my center console. The blue LED status light does let me know when it's charging or not, but this is small consolation when I have a near dead battery and a call comes in. From outside appearances the charger appears fine, but either the wiring near the phone port connector is weakened or the port connector itself is faulty. I have since tested other chargers on my phone and they work fine so it is not a phone or car power outlet problem. If I was stuck somewhere with a dead battery and the price was at or near $5 as it is here, I would buy this. So, other than for emergency or a cheap backup I would spring for something better.Pros- Price. You can't beat the at or near $5 price. Can leave charger plugged even when not in use.Cons- Poorly made. Cord is too short. Great in a pinch only. Will more than likely not function in a few monthsP.S. Another recommendation would be to only use your charger on your phone or the same model. Even though the ports are supposed to be universal, I believe it helped speed up my charger being finicky. Your friends and family may hate you for being ""stingy"" with your charger but at least it has a better chance of working for your phone later.

However I soon discovered that not all books are available on the Kindle and 99.9% of the books I couldn't get on my Kindle are on Nook.  After much research I soon learned that if you want good ebook reader you buy either a Kindle or a Nook.  So I asked Santa for it.I will not tell you I like the Nook better than my Kindle or my Kindle better than my Nook.  Both have excellent features that make them both excellent ereaders.Here's a few on the Nook:  1- It keeps the book title, time, and battery charge visible while reading.  2-It starts up just a bit faster than the Kindle.  3-You can use your own photos for the screen saver and wallpaper.  4-it recognizes the table of contents in PDF books.  5-it reads EPUB file types (meaning you can buy books from Borders.com too and read them)As for the Kindle here are a few features I love about it:  1-I like the real keyboard as the buttons are much easier to push than on screen.  2-It reads PDFS much better than the Nook, more so when you have the PDF converted.  3-the page turns are a bit faster.  4-I prefer the black housing to white.  5-the reading page/screen has no glare at all (the Nook's little color panel on the bottom is very reflective) and it seems the print is a little darker.Both the Nook and Kindle are very easy to purchase and load books on.  I think the thing I was most disappointed in with the Nook are the covers.  They are not enough covers that actually close, like the Kindle and when sticking this reader into your purse or bag, you don't want the cover to open and scratch the screen/reading surface.If you are looking for a great ereader, you cannot go wrong with this Nook or the Kindle latest generation, in my book they are both on the top shelf.  Now if we could just get one that is a smashed together version of both their great features into one unit.Update:  After using both my Nook and Kindle for a while now I've decided I do like the Kindle much better than the Nook.  The page turning buttons on the Kindle are very very light touch, the reading screen does have darker print, and the collections feature is top notch.  Now my Nook, the buttons take some pushing to turn the pages, the reading screen is lighter, and the shelves option is ok.  What I don't care for in the shelves feature is I can't colapse the shelves to just show the shelves and then open them when I want to search in them.  I also don't care for the B&N; Library being seperate from My Documents.  On the Kindle these are all included together and you can sort them out using collections.  With the Nook you must use the naviation screen to switch between them.  I've also had some trouble with the navigation screen on the bottom.  I don't have large fingers and don't wear long fingernails so moving around on the screen should be easy.  However, when I'm tryting to scroll or select something on the touch screen I just can't seem to get what I want.  But when I don't mean to move on the touch screen but accidently touch it, I trigger a menu move.  It's still a very good reader, but when comparing options and usability, I'd choose the Kindle any day over the Nook.  I'll purchase most of my books on the Kindle and what isn't Kindlized will go on the Nook.",5.0,Excellent reader,1293321600,"12 26, 2010",Electronics,1.0,,

Zehui had no issue transmitting music with more bass, but with this unit, it sounded like I had turned the volume to the max and the speakers couldn't handle the bass.  The type of music that I listen to are not hip/pop, rock or rap which has a lot of bass.  I do have the phone BT audio volume turned to the max and likewise fairly loud for the car audio volume (probably because the audio signal is weak). But when I compare the two BT units back to back, the Zehui could handle the audio signal and this unit couldn't. On the other hand, I now use this BT unit with my home stereo system which has its own amplifier. If I lower the phone BT audio volume, it works okey.On a separate note, I had purchased this BT receiver trying to figure out why I couldn't get phone audio from my car speakers.

They all seem to follow the same basic structure which I find to be very helpful in acquiring language skills, and in this case, the basics of Italian language.  I've always wanted to know more about the Italian language but am not motivated to try and become fluent.  Level One for me, is just right.  However, if you are wanting to learn Italian in depth please don't just purchase Level One since it only takes you through some basic elementary language skills.No English is spoken, only Italian and I'm given a lot of visual selections from which to choose the action that represents what I'm hearing in Italian.  I seem to do fairly well having both audio AND a visual component to learning a new language.  Also, I like being able to speak my new Italian words into the included microphone and have the program correct my speech mistakes.  I haven't tried the 3 month on-line service where you can speak with a native speaker (tutor), maybe I would if I were trying to learn the language on a deeper level, but for me I'm happy with just the program itself.  After the 3 months are over you have to pay a fee and I don't like paying fees.I feel fairly confident that anyone who applies themselves regularly to any Rosetta Stone language program will learn a lot of the language being studied.  I find it to be a very natural way to learn a language.  Of course it would be best to be totally immersed in the Italian culture to learn it, but for those of us who don't have that option I think Rosetta Stone does a good job as a cultural immersion substitute.",4.0,Rosetta Stone Italian Level 1,1303171200,"04 19, 2011",Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,1.0,,

As long as you check the threads on its belt loop to make sure they're standing up to normal wear, this thing will never come off (unless you find yourself without your pants, that is).It's slim, cushioned, and due to it's side-zippered design, when you swing your arms as you walk, there's no protruding top flap to brush against.

Sold it last fall and got 1 girl a Kindle Fire 2nd gen, and the other a Lenovo A2107. The Lenovo was absolutely horrid so I wanted to replace it. This summer, when the Nook HD got Google Play, and the prices fell, I sold the Lenovo and got my daughter the Nook HD 16gb Snow. She absolutely loves it! I liked it so much, I got the Nook HD 8gb for myself. I like it much better than my Kindle Fire HD. The size is smaller, and thinner, and lighter, which are great things. And you can put whatever wallpaper you want on it, unlike the Fire HD.I sold the 2nd gen Kindle Fire and gave the other daughter the Fire HD, but she has since switched to a Nook also (HD+). So now I have the Fire HD and the Nook HD for myself. I like the Nook HD better for the reasons stated above. Size and weight are so much smaller on the Nook HD. The screen resolution is also better. There is nothing I don't like about the Nook HD. I did put a GreatShield Glare Screen protector on the Nooks, to reduce the shiny glare. We use them without cases, just sleeves. They are phenomenal tablets.If you or the person you are buying for loves to play games and will likely download hundreds of them, definitely get the 16gb Nook HD. You will want as much space for apps as you can afford, despite the SD card slot. Games have to be installed to internal memory, for the most part. The SD card slot comes in handy for books, movies, photos and music. I got the 8 gb Nook HD for myself, because I don't play games, the only apps I need are for reading, playing music, news, web, stuff like that. I put my files on the SD card and I am set!I don't plan to buy the new Fires when they come out.  They are far too limited, in my opinion. (So was the Nook, of course, until they added Google Play). I have ADW Launcher on all three of the Nooks, though my daughters tend to prefer the standard Nook launcher. What shows up on that home page can be customized to show only what you want it to show. There is also an ""app drawer"" icon that shows the most recently opened apps for easy launching. It really is a great design, and far superior to the tiresome carousel on the Kindle Fires.",5.0,We LOVE the NOOK HD!,1379203200,"09 15, 2013",Electronics,1.0,,

Nice screen and seems much more white than the Kindle Touch I returned.  I did root it to run Android, so it tends to lag in apps that it was never meant to run, but in reader apps, it's great.  It also has a micro SD slot (32GB works fine) which is the main reason I chose it.  That and the fact that it is so easily rooted, with a large support community.  I liked the Kindle's sleek looks more than the Nook, but the screen on this is definitely better for reading (can't speak for the new Kindle Paper White).  I haven't read outdoors with it yet, so no info there.  Now I have a ton of ebooks and, more importantly, all my college text books in PDF format.  In fact now that it's rooted, I can read any format file by getting an app (including the Kindle app!).  Web browsing is okay with Opera mobile.  Email is great.  Video is not possible, but eink offer a couple of months of battery life (even a few weeks would be great) which makes up for any shortfalls.  I leave my laptop home most days now.

Gnoza ""polishsumgai""","[1, 1]","I used to carry a well known name brand multitool until I found THREE superior options ( my decision was based on 40+ years as a fire fighter, police officer and bomb disposal technician ( EOD ). I have owned a number of multitools over the years and abused them all ( that's why the good ones have a lifetime warranty ). The three best for the money in my opinion are the 1. SOG Powerlock , 2. Victorinox SwissTool and 3. SOG Pocket PowerPlier - don't waste your money on anything else - no other multitool can come close to a SOG or Victorinox in performance, functionality and warranty. I do own other brand multitools and have a desk drawer full of them and they are used solely for opening envelopes and packages. When I need a multitool at work I want a `real' multitool that I can depend on to do the job at hand - the following 3 are my choices, depending on the assignment.The first rescue multi-tool worth your money is a SOG Powerlock ( various models are now available to suit your needs - "" including the assisted opening ""). I prefer the S66 because of the tool / implement selection. This folding tool isn't new, a fact that speaks to its highly regarded Compound Leverage mechanism that generates twice the pressure and gripping power of lesser tools. To wit: this thing is the Jaws of multitools. Beyond strength, you'll love the pivoting handle covers that really do improve comfort and dexterity. All the essential tools are intricately positioned for deployment and for you showoffs out there, the PowerLock's ability to open with a quick flick of the wrist is undeniably cool. The PowerLock features removable, pivoting handle covers that improve the comfort profile for your hand. More pressure can now be exerted on those tough jobs! Like the rest of the family in the series, the PowerLock can be opened and closed with a one-handed flip of the wrist. This is a basic requirement from SOG as so often one is holding wires or standing on a ladder and does not have both hands free. All tool components are easy to access and lock in the open position. The Phillips even locks in two open positions. With one of the simplest and safest locking devices ever engineered, just press the back of the lock and close the component into the handle. Included components in the S66 include a plier / gripper, 3"" straight blade, 3"" serrated blade,3 sided file,large screwdriver, Phillips screwdriver, small screwdrive, medium screwdriver, can opener, bottle opener, ""V"" cutter, wire crimper, blasting cap crimper, compound leverage, comfort grips, rulers and lanyard ring. The PowerLock also comes with a heavy-duty, dark leather pouch. A standard design issue with any SOG multipurpose tool is the advantage of it's hex bolt construction. This essential design element gives you the greatest versatility to clean and change tool components ( additional tool components are directly available from SOG for a modest charge) - with hex bolt construction holding the SOG's together - replacing tools is a snap. The SOG features all stainless steel construction ( also available in a black oxide finish #B66) and comes with a heavy duty leather pouch, a Lifetime Guarantee and they are MADE IN THE USA. Street price is around $55.00.The second multitool in the lineup is a Victorinox SwissTool which comes equipped with both a plain edge AND a serrated blade / seat belt cutter which can be life saving in a auto accident.  Victorinox Swisstools are quality unsurpassed , as are ALL of the lineup of Swiss Army Knives. The implements on the SwissTool are well thought out, each tool is individually accessible and locks securely in place. The knife blades are scary sharp and probably the sharpest of any production line knife made today, plus they are stainless steel. The heftyness of the tool speaks of it's quality, ruggedness and ability to do the job. I have broken the plier head jaws on several other manufacturers multitools , never on a Swisstool, including the smaller Swisstool Spirit, they are made to last a lifetime. I have had occasion to send Swiss Army Knives t Made in Switzerland with a lifetime warranty. Street price around $50.00.My most recent addition to the ""Best of the Best multitools "", the third, in my arsenal of multitools and I find it adequate to do 99% of the jobs handled by the two mentioned above. Lighter and more compact than the SOG PowerLock, its big brother, the Pocket PowerPlier ( Model #S44 ) is very easy to carry and use. SOG's Pocket PowerPlier is packed with essential tools that include pliers/grippers, wire cutters, partially serrated blade, Phillips screwdriver, three-sided file, can opener with a small screwdriver, bottle opener with medium screwdriver, an awl, rulers, lanyard and heavy duty leather pouch. Again the PPP's advantage of hex bolt construction leaves all the other multitools running for cover as this essential design element gives you the greatest versatility to clean and change tool components ( additional tool components are directly available from SOG for a modest charge) not offered by other multitool manufacturers. With the interchangability you can replace the partially serrated blade with a 3"" plain edge blade and I also removed the 3 sided file and replaced it with a serrated line cutter. I find carrying the PPP a benefit because of less weight hanging on my belt ( 5.5 ounces vs 9.6 ounces for the PowerLock) . Also noted is SOG's Deluxe Pocket PowerPlier ( Model S45) whichs adds a large screwdriver, 1/4 socket drive however it loses the awl as a tool and weighs in at 5.5 ounces - same as he S44 model. Backed by a Lifetime Guarantee and they are MADE IN THE USA.

It is a little pricier than some of the competition from Casio and Timex. However, it offers some nice advantages over most others, with only a couple drawbacks. I wore mine for two tours in Iraq and it performed perfectly. Not that I truly ever relied on the Comp-Baro-Alti features, because we always had other more advanced devices for that. But it was reassuring to have those capabilities on my wrist at all times. And the basic time, stopwatch, alarm and timer functions were used often and performed well.Pros:User replaceable battery - very helpful in the field and easy to do, saves money.Broad array of functions - easy to manipulate the various features with a little practice and reading the manual.Very accurate - the watch loses very little time over the months and years, good quartz movement.Good water resistance - not a dive watch, but it holds up well, even under several meters of water, which I've done.Comfortable despite its large size - pretty light weight and a large, comfortable band.Easy to read - large face, big numbers.Attractive design - very distinct look.Cons:Not solar-atomic (like Casio Pathfinder) - however, battery is easily replaced and the quartz movement is very accurate.Thicker case - more so than the Casio PAW1300, but not too bad.Bottonology - the button function layout is different than most Timex and Casios, but isn't too hard to figure out.Price - higher than many, but not excessive for what you get.Overall, despite the drawbacks referenced above, I highly recommend the Suunto X-Lander and I would assume the other Suunto models are also good.

The game takes about 1 hour to play.  The only good thing I can say is the artwork is beautiful.  The cover belongs in a frame and should be hung on a wall. I was accused of being vindictive for blocking two other players deliberately, which is not against the rules.  When I suggested modifying some rules, which would make that type of strategy a waste, those two players said no.  I went to bed angry that night for being labeled the villain.  I was still angry the next morning, and I was angry all day at work over the game!  I haven't played it with them since. Two rules I consider most needing to be fixed are: 1. There should be no penalty for incomplete destinations. 2. Allow the use of double paths for THREE or more players. When a player's destination becomes DELIBERATELY blocked, I see the same kind of irritation you get when a player is attacked in the game of RISK, and that attack takes a continent away from them. Also, the small cars are too easily knocked around on the board. If someone offered me some money for the game, it would take 2 seconds for me to sell it.

One of the best things about the game is it's very luck-based so depending on your roll, and the cards you may or may not receive based on the dice, you can go from being on top to the very bottom in a single turn. I've seen people come from behind - at about ten ""VP"" or victory points and win the game in a single round having made a good use of a card and taken out an adventurer.The game was originally designed to be used during a D&D; (Dungeons and Dragons) game the make a tavern brawl a little more fun and interesting, but having played D&D; for years, they can be interesting and tactically-challenging enough without adding a 1-hour card/dice game into the mix.  The game can go very quickly or very slow all depending on the dice and how the players implement their cards.One thing to note is that inside the box, there's a card that says to go to Wizards website to create your own characters and apparently this IS NOT an option. The site's page doesn't exist, nor from my research has ever existed.  I created my own template by scanning a card at 600dpi and implementing my Photoshop skills, and I'll probably upload the template to Boardgamegeek at some point in the near future.  It's fun using characters you've made for Dungeons and Dragons in the game and creating a skillset that make sense for them as a character for this little game, but is not necessary at all. The characters included in the game are all fun to use.I play this regularly with the family and we have two kids, ages 7 and 6 and they have a fun time as well. Keep in mind that the artwork is a bit sexy since the regular audience for D&D; is males ages 10-30, but there's nothing overtly offensive.

The game consists of cards, a quick set up guide, a rule book, and some envelopes.  You will need to provide some paperclips in order to play.  I was impressed by the components.  The cards are good quality, nicely designed, and easy to read.  I liked the colors and the layout of the cards.The one issue that I had with components is that you will be putting paper clips on your cards and moving them up and down.  We used metal paper clips and this scratched the cards.  This doesn't really affect game-play; it's more of an aesthetics issue.  I would make sure that you use plastic or coated paper clips when you play.The goal of the game is to apply to different colleges throughout the game.  At the end of the game you will decide which college to attend based on which colleges accepted you.  After you decide which college to attend you will score points based on how you played throughout the game.  The player with the most points wins.At the beginning of the game everyone draws a character card and a family finances card.  The different characters give special abilities.  For example, the die hard can take five actions when he draws a card that only gives him 3 actions.  Your family finance card can give you some bonus cash to start with.Each turn you draw a productivity card that tells you how many action points you will have.  The cards have amusing flavor text, such as the Up Late Gaming Card; ""It's 3am - time to put down the controller.""  The productivity cards all have what actions can be used for printed on them, which was a nice touch.Actions are used to do many things.  You can draw activity cards.  The activity cards are divided into extracurricular, academics, work, and service.  You can also use an action to level up one of your activity cards.  This is just like leveling up a planeswalker in Magic, the Gathering.  Each activity card has different levels to it.  Some of the levels have icons that represent letters of recommendations, good grades, money, or other bonuses.  To level up a card you spend the actions that it specifies on the card and you move your paper clip up that level.Actions can also be used to draw question cards.  You read the question to all of the players and let them answer it.  The questions are all related to college, such as ""What is the difference between AA, BA, and BS degrees?""  When you ask a question you get to level up an academic card one level.  You also get to decide which player had the best answer to the question and they also get to level up an academic card.  The question cards have answers to the questions printed on them, so that kids can compare the answers they hear with what's on the card.You can also use actions to put cards in your application envelopes and to put your envelope next to a college or event.  There is a series of cards that come out during the game.  These represent colleges and other things, such as college fairs and financial aid.  To apply for these things you use an action to ""submit"" an envelope next to one.  Every turn you look through the envelopes of the players that applied to that school to see who got in.At the end of the game everyone looks through the schools that they were accepted to and decides which one to attend.  You must have acquired enough money to pay for that school by the end of the game.  You then calculate your score based on how you have leveled up your cards throughout the game.  Each school gives you points depending on how many icons you have earned throughout the game.  For example art school will give points for cards that have levels of fine art, while the selective state school gives more points for academics.I played a two player game with a friend who likes Eurogames.  The game is for 3-4 players but we were just trying to figure out how everything worked.  We found that the mechanics worked together well.  My friend liked how asking a question was a good way to game the system, as you could level up a card for one action when some cards required two actions to level up.I played another game with the same friend and two high school students.  One student was a senior and had already applied and been accepted to college.  The other student was a sophomore and hasn't started applying to schools.  Both students said that this wasn't the kind of game that they would choose to play for fun.  However, they both said that they enjoyed playing it and that it taught them a lot about the application process.  They said that it showed how one had to be well rounded and balance things like academics and work.  They also really seemed to enjoy the question cards, which brought up some good discussion.Things I really liked about the game:I liked the leveling up mechanic.I liked the little envelopes.  My 5 year old daughter almost ran away with them when she saw them.I liked how the game forces you to think about different aspects of applying to college.  You are forced to look at your money situation, grades, service activities, and the like.  The students I played with said that it was eye opening to see that they had to focus on so many different things when looking into college.I would recommend this game to anyone who works with college bound students.  Playing the game can be a great springboard for discussion.  I liked how the game made the students think concretely about something that can seem abstract and distant.  College seemed almost like a myth when I was in high school.  It was something that I would eventually go to and that was all I really thought about it.  This game does a good job of providing hooks for students to use when thinking about college.  They can gain some insight to navigating the application process.  Any game that can be fun and teach  at the same time is a good game in my opinion.",5.0,Increase Your College Knowledge,1331251200,"03 9, 2012",Toys_and_Games,1.0,,

Swartz ""DrGerm""","[4, 4]","In my attempts to nerdify my 5 year old girl, I've introduced her to D&D; miniatures and have created table top games with these. She loves the miniatures and rolling dice, but I wanted to increase the complexity of our little games a bit and I had been eye-balling this (and the Wrath of Ashardalon) set and thought I'd give it a go to see if she'd get into one of these board games.First off, I was a little worried that this game would not be durable to withstand a hyper 5 year old girl, but after the initial un-boxing and then about an hour of game play, I can assure you that this product should withstand some decent use. I even let her pop out half the board pieces (she loved doing that) and I was happy to find that these popped out easily without tearing, etc. The miniatures are sturdy enough too (I think they are exactly the usual D&D; Mini's, just not painted).In regards to the actual game, it took me about an hour to un-box and then read the instruction. The basic instructions did not make full sense right away, but after getting into game-play and following the included card with the steps of your round (Hero phase -> Exploration phase -> Villain phase), it sank in fairly quickly. I basically had to walk my daughter through the entire encounter but SHE LOVED IT. She quickly picked up on some of the basic math; i.e. she understood the basic mechanics of attack rolls having to be higher than the targets AC and she was able to do the basic math of a d20 + attack bonus (usually). Of course, what she couldn't do was read any of the cards or strategize her moves; but she was just happy to be playing a game and was eager to just do what Daddy told her to do!Then, let's talk about the treasure cards: she LOVES treasure (I taught her to call these ""Phat Loot"" cards! LOL) and she loved rolling the d20, even if there is no reason whatsoever to roll the dice, she just rolls and rolls.Anyway, Parents, if you are looking to nerdify your little kids without abandon, then don't be turned off by the recommended age of 12+ on this product, I think you can still find this to be a fun game with younger kids and may even introduce them to some basics of table top RPG mechanics.",5.0,Fun.

(However I immediately received an email trying to soliciting a five start review from me from either the seller or the manufacturer so I think maybe it won't be so hyped if they don't use those ""tricks"").Like the title says, the quality is so so, when compared to either the incase revolution folio which I got for close to $80 from BB or the bear motion folio I got from right here which cost like 2 bucks more.Even the packaging tells this, Bear motion one is packed in a reusable zippered zip-loc type bag while this one is in a flimsy single use plastic bag with some glue to hold it in place and some paper with an awful Advertisement on it(it's hard to tell why would they pay to print an Advertisement to sell you something that you have already bought) which basically reads ""you wear clothes, so your device needs to wear devicewear product"", I for one don't really see why that is the case.Then to the case itself, well it seems to be a fine leather case, however it's really PITA to get your ipad into it. Getting out is literally like pulling your ipad apart. I understand pulling ipad out of a folio is not something you do everyday but that doesn't mean it should be so hard. Not to mention if any dust get in (which is very likely considering there's no outer shell and there are multiple exposed areas) and trapped between your ipad and the case. Then pulling it out will certainly result in a deep and long scratch because they are held so closely together.The Velcro strip used to hold the ipad in place is also very flimsy, I don't know how much they could bring the cost down on something as simple as that but they unfortunately chose to be cheap on that. It basically can't hold itself in place, let alone the Ipad. (However the ipad won't necessarily fall out, because of the above mentioned ""hard to get out"". Maybe that's by design? Then they shouldn't have used the velcro strip at all right?)Lack of a outer protecting bag and obvious logo on folio might not be a problem for some (or even for me) but it would be nice to see those, cause the competitor did those right.The bear motion one is also much better made if you place both before you and have a close look.All in all, Isuggest anyone who is interested in an affordable leather folio for their Ipad 3 get the bear motion one instead of this one.

A call to Nook tech support confirmed that the product was defective, and they assured us that a legitimate seller would replace it.  We requested a replacement from Worldwide Distributors, but they refused, suggesting that it was a warranty issue. I then filed a complaint claim with Amazon, who contacted Worldwide Distributors. Their response was to point out that their return policy states that they will not take back electronic products which have been opened. (How else can a buyer find out if it works?) That's a nice gig if you can get it, selling high dollar electronic products with no responsibility whatsoever if they turn out to be worthless junk. Unfortunately, Amazon backed up their claim, based on the ""published"" return policy. In 12 years as a steady Amazon buyer, I've never looked up and read a return policy. It's sad to think that I have to from now on. (When I buy DOA products at my local Radio Shack, they exchange them without batting an eye.) So I'm stuck in a protracted fight, out over $200.00, and own a paperweight that looks just like a Nook Tablet.

For some reason I decided I needed a Stormtrooper helmet to wear with my Utilikilt. I know... an odd combination to some, but makes perfect sense to me. I started looking for helmets here on Amazon and found the one I wanted. Only problem was it costs $150. I actually put it in my wish list to ponder whether I'd be willing to part with $150 for something that I wasn't going to wear that often. Finally decided to go with the economy version and bought this one.First, as others have pointed out, the helmet that ships isn't the one in the photo. The black perforated eye areas actually have smoked gray plastic lenses (thankfully). Most everything else seems to be pretty accurate. Also, as others have pointed out, the helmet is in 4 pieces that don't stay together very well. You'll want some krazy glue or duct tape to make sure you're not fighting with it if you drop it or are a little rough on it. Even when it's put together I can see a bit of a gap on the seam that runs across the top.

I had previously bought bands from a Chinese supplier and the cables all snapped after a few months of use. These bands were cheaper, came with the carrying case and exercise chart, and the quality much better. The connection between the band and the bracket/strap is the key, and these are well-designed and shouldn't break.The only issue I had was that I received 2 handles of different designs. One was smaller in girth and length, and had a smaller ring on the strap. It also didn't have a brand logo on it so I assume it was a previous revision/design. It is annoying to have 2 handles of different size (and strength - I'd rather the newer, stronger version). So I contacted the supplier, and they just offered to return the item for full refund, and I would need to re-order. I was travelling soon and taking these bands with me and I didn't have time to do that. They couldn't send me the proper handle directly, so I was quite disappointed with this.See customer photos to find a picture of the different handles.Good product, but the customer service wasn't above and beyond...",4.0,"Good quality product, different handles received",1376438400,"08 14, 2013",Sports_and_Outdoors,1.0,,

With the price drop they had down to $79 (might have been temporary for Black Friday weekend) I ran out of excuses not to buy it.  I'm still using my old Nook color as an ereader and this price I couldn't resist getting a nice upgrade.Here is what is great about this tablet, you get a decent stock operating system now that B&N; allows access to the Google Play store and apps.  Right out of the box, it is very nice already.  But for tinkerers like myself, the best thing is to set it up with a custom Android ROM, there is a great one called Cyanogenmod 10.1 - this is basically a stock Android 4.2.2 set up to run on the Nook HD - gives you an interface and user experience much like what you get on the new model Nexus 7.  I requires some computer skills and a 4GB or bigger microSD card, took me about 30 minutes to do.There are plenty of tutorials/directions online, it is not terribly difficult for anyone who is even mildly computer savvy.  The most important thing to do for the sake of being able to go back to stock - for warranty or any reason - is to use a recovery tool to first back up the stock B&N; ROM before you flash the tablet with the custom ROM.  The same recovery program that I used to flash the custom ROM has an option right in the menu to create a backup of the stock ROM right onto the microSD card, pretty easy.While I decided to completely overwrite the stock B&N; ROM, there is also an option to set up a microSD card with a custom ROM and you can then basically dual-boot and not even affect the stock B&N; ROM.  Take out the SD card and reboot the tablet and you are back to a totally stock Nook HD.  Again, plenty of tutorials online that explain how to go about doing all of this stuff.Functionally the Nook HD with Cyanogenmod 10.1 is probably 90% of what the 2013 Nexus 7 does at less than half the cost.  The biggest glaring difference is the lack of any cameras, it has neither front or back - but to be honest I never used them on the several years that I have owned tablets except for a couple of times to Skype.  For photos and video I whip out the phone, which is always in my pocket, better sized for that purpose, and equipped with far superior camera lenses and sensors.  The Nook HD with my custom ROM is running a fairly new Android version and is sufficiently fast enough for anything I need it to do, read books, play games, web surf, Netflix, etc.  The screen resolution on the Nook HD is just right for a 7 inch tablet, as somebody who has also owned/owns a Nexus 10, Samsung GS4, and Moto X, I can tell you that anything above 250 ppi starts to really get to a point of diminishing returns.  The added sharpness is barely perceptible and you need a lot more horsepower from your device to power the screen plus you incur more battery drain.On the Nook HD, I can load a full webpage and read text pretty comfortably without having to zoom in.  This is very serviceable for doing just about anything but a high resolution 9"" to 10"" screen is definitely the better way to go for frequently viewing larger content like webpages and digital magazines.  This serves my purpose better since my priority was a lighter and smaller tablet that I slide in the back pocket and can easily hold in one hand to read books, etc.The obvious point I am trying to make is that for $80-$100, you will not find a better 7"" tablet, especially if you mod it with a good Android ROM.  In summary, I'll list out the positives and negatives at the end of this review.  Most of the negatives are honestly minor especially when factoring price, but I'll be critical and point out every little thing that I have observed.  Take the negatives with a grain of salt, I am still rating this as a 5 star product.I would love to be able to really solidify this review further by comparing this directly with the Kindle Fire HD but I'm not sure that is even necessary.  Even without having used a Kindle Fire HD, I find the Nook HD to be a likely easy winner between the two since it is typically cheaper, has a higher resolution screen, slightly faster CPU, offers a microSD slot, and is less locked down even in stock form now that the stock B&N; ROM lets you into the Google Play store (the Kindle Fire HD can also be tweaked to do this and of course you can go the full route of installing a custom ROM on that as well).  You don't lose any of the great Amazon stuff with this tablet.  Download the Kindle app and you can buy and read books through Amazon's Kindle store.  Download the Boat Browser from the Google Play store, turn on the flash plugin in settings, and you can watch Amazon Prime videos.Okay, enough said - here's the summary:PROS:-Price, as long as it is being sold for ~$100 or less.-Sufficiently powerful CPU/hardware specs to do most everything without any noticeable lag or performance issues.  Very zippy with the custom ROM I installed (Cyanogenmod 10.1).  Video playback is excellent, I'm able to stream 720p on my network without issues.-Excellent screen, color and sharpness is superb, gets as bright as I need it to indoors in any lighting (have not tested outdoors).-Build quality seems good, tablet feels tight and solid overall, buttons feel tight and solid also.-Touchscreen is accurate and responsive.-Light and comfortable to hold, soft concave rubberized back is very nice.-Stereo speakers are rear facing but suitably loud and clear sounding without my having to do the 'hand cupping' to direct the sound forward.-MicroSD card slot means you can expand memory up to 64GB or run custom ROMs without having to permanently install them.-Proprietary charging cable has a larger much more robust connector than the flimsy microUSB plug most android tablets use (which I hate despite the advantage of being 'universal' and cheap to replace).CONS:-Having to use an flashed or SD card based custom ROM to get rid of the B&N; limited version of android and get the full android experience (not everyone can or wants to do this).-No cameras-MicroSD card slot cover is total crap, takes a lot of effort to pry open and you feel like you will end up tearing it off by mistake.  Fortunately most people won't need to mess with it more than a few times - once you have your microSD card in there it can be left alone.-Shiny plastic they used around the outer edge of the bezel and the microSD slot cover looks really cheap.  Fortunately the front part of the bezel (which is probably the same plastic) has a nicer looking matte finish.  Design is dull and simple looking.  Not thick but not exactly super thin or 'svelte' looking.-Volume buttons are a little awkward due being positioned a little too close to the corner for comfort and also being tilted away from the index finger because of the beveled angle of the bezel, plus they take a bit of effort to depress.-Proprietary charging cable and it will not charge from computer USB port apparently - because of this it is probably a good idea to buy a spare cable but they are still way overpriced.-Proprietary HDMI adapter for video output is also expensive, way overpriced.",5.0,"Probably the best 7"" tablet choice right now (Dec 2013)",1385856000,"12 1, 2013",Electronics,1.0,,

I'm actually kind of amused by all the Righty complaints here - welcome to our world.  That said, I do think Moleskine should change the design slightly so that the case can be set up in either orientation according to the user's preference.Pros:Beautiful styling.Notebook is very handy.Holds the Kindle very snugly.  I have a silicone skin on mine, and the elastic bands do fit around the skin.Cons:A little pricey.Replacement notebooks are very pricey for what they are.Lacks pen loop.Suggestions:Change inside cover design to allow for ambidextrous notepad configuration.Add a pen loop.Instead of elastic, take advantage of the case-attachment slots on the left side of the Kindle.",5.0,Fantastic case!,1279843200,"07 23, 2010",Electronics,1.0,,

Most of them could be played without actually having to buy anything, and most of the best party games don't require any components at all (like Truth or Dare, Have You Ever, or Quarters. OK, Quarters has components, but not many game companies are going to start selling rolls of quarters and pitchers of beer). The end result is that, while I see lots of party games, I don't tend to like very many of them.The Game of Things, from Hasbro, is one I like. In fact, it's one of the few I break out on a regular basis. It has the potential for a huge amount of hilarious fun, and it's equally playable with a room full of teenagers or a geriatric nursing home. Like nearly every party game ever, it relies on not playing with idiots to have fun, but I think that applies to nearly anything, from Risk to water-skiing (there are exceptions - it can be hilarious to play Red Light, Green Light with a retard).In Things (I'm abbreviating the name because I'm lazy), you've got a big deck of descriptions. These descriptions might be 'Things you would like to do with chocolate', or 'Things you would do if you could change genders for a day'. One person reads the description out loud, and everyone writes a thing that would be an answer, like 'eat it' or 'play Darjeeling.' Then you go around the table and take turns guessing who wrote what.Like most party games, the actual scoring is almost completely irrelevant. You don't really care who wins. The point is to hang out and have fun with people you may or may not like, unless you're playing with my father-in-law, in which case the point is to be as horribly inappropriate as possible (when asked for 'Things you wish you could check out in the library', he wrote 'the librarian'. In all fairness, I wrote 'whiskey and whores,' so it was kind of a tie for worst place).It's tough to write an in-depth review of a game as simple as The Game of Things. You read a card, everyone writes an answer, then you guess who wrote what. That's really it. It's not like there's strategy, outside playing like my son and writing answers that sound like someone else wrote them (like for 'Things cannibals think about while dining,' he wrote, 'I wish I had a good dark beer,' and everyone thought I wrote that. I wrote 'Mmm, tastes like chicken.') But even though it's not very deep, if you can get the right crowd of miscreants together, this can be a lot of fun. I've laughed myself through dozens of games of Things, although it's not always safe to play with kids (especially if you're playing with people who would answer 'Things you should not photograph' with 'your junk'. Like me).Apparently, Hasbro was trying to appeal to collector-types when they made The Game of Things, because it comes in a really nice wooden box. There's no reason it couldn't have come in a cardboard box like every other game, but the wooden slide-top box is a really nice touch. And the pretty box makes people think it must be better than other games, which it really is not, but they don't know that, so they'll play with you.On a scale that goes from Strip Spin the Bottle to Apples to Apples, The Game of Things falls somewhere around Taboo. It's a good time, but not as much fun as being 19 and getting naked with a roomful of pretty girls while you drink yourself into a stupor. But then, you can play Things with your in-laws, and if you play Strip Anything with your in-laws, please don't tell me about it.",5.0,Party Game Review - The Game of Things,1281744000,"08 14, 2010",Toys_and_Games,1.0,,
